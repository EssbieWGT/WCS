May Day is recognized by many countries and organizations as International Workers Day, and hundreds of thousands of people across the U.S. and the world took to the streets to protest, with many condemning the Trump administration, the administration’s aggressive rhetoric toward other countries, fears of global economic turmoil, and hostility toward immigrants’ rights. 
In Alaska, protests took place in at least 21 communities according to reports on social media, on Thursday and others planned through the weekend, from the Arctic region to Southeast Alaska. 
Organizers in several communities spoke with the Alaska Beacon after rallies wrapped up on Thursday, and expressed hope in the unified protest effort and great concern for the impacts of firing federal workers and threatened cuts to essential services, like health care. 
In Petersburg, an estimated 75 people rallied downtown around noon, according to Chelsea Tremblay, one of the organizers with the community group, Petersburg Friends and Neighbors. She said speakers focused on the importance of workers rights, and demonstrators called on Alaska’s congressional delegation to do more, “to stand up for our communities and to keep the separation of powers strong,” she said. “By fighting for the funds that have been allocated to come to our communities, and to stop the loss of jobs.”

Tremblay said Petersburg has been impacted by the federal firings and budget cuts to the U.S. Forest Service in the Tongass National Forest, Head Start, and the end of federal telework options, as well as particular concern around further cuts to the National Weather Service. “That’s a safety issue, right? Or potential funds being withheld from public broadcasting that have already been dedicated, but that’s how people stay connected with the community when they’re out on the boats,” she said. 
She said the group also raised funds for local homelessness services. “We’re stronger together,” she added. “So it feels good to be in solidarity with so many other communities.” 
In the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, an estimated 200 people gathered for a rally in Wasilla, said organizer Dave Musgrave, with the activist group Mat-Su United for Progress. “This was really to lift up unions, and show that we are standing with working families,” he said.
There were speeches, a hot dog roast and a live band that played union songs. “And then people stood along Parks Highway with their signs protesting various things from the (Trump) administration. I’d say the overwhelming concern was the threat to democracy, and our Constitution.”

Musgrave said Mat-Su residents are deeply concerned about federal cuts, particularly any proposed cuts to health care through Medicaid, as about one-third of all Alaska residents rely on the program. 
“That includes pregnant women, that includes single adults, it includes kids,” through the related Denali KidCare program, he said. “And the fallout is going to be for all Alaskans, because it’s not just those on Medicaid. This will cripple our health care system, including hospitals, medical clinics – our whole medical infrastructure is under threat right now.”
On the Kenai Peninsula in Soldotna, organizer Michele Vasquez with the activist group Many Voices said residents are also extremely concerned about job cuts and threats to health care, including for those whose jobs don’t provide them with insurance.
“The folks in between. They work. They work one, two, three jobs, but they’re still working, and they’re still on Medicaid,” she said. “So the impacts to Alaska overall could be very, very devastating.” She said the region is feeling the impacts of job losses, and threatened cuts to services like libraries and public radio sow more uncertainty. “There have been a lot of devastating losses of jobs, and any loss of jobs in Alaska is detrimental.” 
The May Day rally drew an estimated 140 people in Soldotna Creek Park, she said, “in support of workers, union and nonunion.” She said speakers highlighted the importance of supporting disability rights, reproductive health care, and uniting together to push back against the Trump administration. The crowd also raised funds and gathered donations for the local food bank.

Vasquez said some Republicans and Trump voters have joined their protest events over the last month. “Surprisingly,” she said, “It was just shocking to me that they were willing to admit it. And I don’t mean that in a bad way. I think it depends on who they are, what their status is,” she said.
“Mainly, I’ve talked to seniors who are of all political stripes, who are terrified of losing Medicare, of losing their Social Security or their veterans benefits. My husband and I fall into that category, so I can clearly understand why everyone would be fearful,” she said, adding her husband is a retired veteran and disabled. 
“All across political spectrums, we’re all a little scared,” Vasquez said. “Because they’re worried, you know? We’re worried about what happens to our house if we can’t make the mortgage payments? What if we can’t buy food? It’s just, it’s kind of a commonality.”
In Talkeetna, organizer Sandra Loomis said a group of 54 people rallied for May Day, and to protest the Trump agenda. “We marched down Main Street and got a nice picture right there on the river, where you can see Denali behind and did a nice chant, ‘8647,’” she said, referring to the anti-Trump chant to “86,” or reject, the 47th president. 
“People are fed up and just tired of this, all this open corruption from the White House,” Loomis said. “And taking away all our services, taking away our libraries, taking away research, taking away our rights, taking away economic equity. People are fed up and tired of it. It’s way, way, way beyond the pale, and too far, and the blatant disregard of the Constitution and the Supreme Court orders.”

Loomis said Talkeetna residents are also concerned around the federal firings, cuts to programs like Medicaid and the recent cut to Americorps. She expressed outrage and frustration at the Trump administration threatening the press, law firms and universities. Of special concern was Trump’s recent refusal to acknowledge that an image of alleged gang tattoos on a man deported to El Salvador was Photoshopped, “blatantly lying to everyone, right to our faces and like, we know they’re lying!” 
She said the actions go against the core values and principles that the country was founded on. “My family, multiple generations of my family, have fought for the freedoms that we’ve enjoyed,” she said. “One of the things that has made America such an amazing place to live — it’s because we have diversity. It’s because we accept all religions and respect each other.” 
In Juneau, roughly 400 people gathered in front of the Alaska State Capitol, despite the rain, for speeches, calls to protect workers, unions and essential social services, and a performance by the Woosh.ji.een Dance Group. “Get up! Get down. Juneau is a union town!” the crowd chanted, before marching to Marine Park by the cruise ship dock. They also collected donations for the Southeast Alaska Food Bank.  
Organizers said residents are continuing to make regular calls and emails to the state’s congressional delegation, particularly U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who they said has been responsive to their concerns. 
Different groups nationally have said the next national day of action is a People’s Parade planned for June 14, Flag Day.

Initial reactions to the order from the Nebraska federal delegation have been mixed.,"The headquarters of Nebraska Public Media on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s East Campus. (Courtesy of Nebraska Public Media)LINCOLN — President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Thursday seeking to end federal funding for public media. 
It marks the White House’s latest escalation in its political battle with the media, as Trump and some congressional Republicans fulfill a pledge to cut funding to the organizations. Unlike other executive orders that he signed in public ceremonies, Trump signed this one behind closed doors, while flying on Air Force One, Politico reported. 
Initial reactions to the order from the Nebraska all-Republican federal delegation have been mixed. U.S. Reps. Mike Flood, who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, echoed Trump’s criticisms of NPR’s national bias but defended the unique value Nebraska Public Media provides locally. U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, who represents the largely rural 3rd District and U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts had no immediate comment Friday. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, who represents the Omaha-based 2nd District, highlighted how crucial Nebraska Public Media remains to the state. 
Gov. Jim Pillen also offered no immediate comment through a spokeswoman while visiting Washington, D.C., to see the president this week. If Trump’s order withstands promised legal challenges, PBS could lose nearly 15% of its annual revenue and NPR could lose 1% of its budget. While federal funding is a fraction of the budget for the national independent public news organizations, federal funding does help smaller, often rural, local affiliate stations of both afford to operate in places the free market might not serve as well. 
Closer to home, the impact could be significant. Nebraska Public Media could lose up to 16% of its annual budget, which could put essential services at risk, including emergency alert systems. The timing creates a budget hole that the state might be hard-pressed to fill during a budget shortfall.

Trump’s order calls for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit corporation authorized by Congress to receive federal funds and distribute them to support public broadcasting, to “cancel existing direct funding to the maximum extent allowed by law and … decline to provide future funding” to the news organizations.
“Which viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter,” the order reads. “What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.” 
Trump also has claimed that NPR and PBS produce “biased and partisan news coverage.” 
The heads of NPR and PBS have defended their federal funding and coverage before a U.S. House Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, subcommittee meeting in March.
Bacon said, “he respects the great job that NPR and PBS have done in Nebraska.” 
Congress allocates more than $500 million annually to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and specifies its intended use. The funding is administered in two-year cycles, scheduled in advance, a structure designed to shield public media from political pressure. 
CPB officials questioned the legitimacy of the president’s new order. The private nonprofit is already suing the Trump administration over another executive order seeking to fire three of its five board members.
PBS and NPR have called the order unlawful, saying it infringed on the freedom of the press. Both plan to challenge it in court. 
Order ‘limits Nebraska Public Media’
Nebraska Public Media, which is responsible for all public TV and radio stations in the state, receives approximately $4 million in federal funding, representing roughly 16% of its annual budget. NPM General Manager and CEO Stacey Decker said that while the station is still evaluating the impacts of Trump’s latest executive order, NPM is “deeply disappointed.” 
“It limits Nebraska Public Media’s ability to make independent and locally focused decisions about the programming and resources we provide to Nebraskans,” Decker’s statement reads.  “It also severs the strong local-national partnership that is the backbone of public media, delivering trusted, valued and essential programming and services to all Americans.”
The state funds roughly 44% of the NPM budget, according to information published on the NPM website. Nebraska Public Media is tasked with live-streaming the legislative session and public hearings on bills. NPM also is among the few Nebraska news organizations staffing the State Capitol with reporters daily during the session. 
“Even during this challenging time, we are steadfast in our commitment to provide every Nebraskan with trusted, valued and essential programs and services,” Decker said. “Just as we have for more than 70 years.” 
NPM’s ‘unique value’
Flood said the Trump executive order is “an opportunity for America to scrutinize the work of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to stop the liberal bias that has infected National Public Radio, and to rethink how federal funding works for local public broadcasting networks.” 
But Flood, who runs his own private media company that includes News Channel Nebraska,  emphasized Nebraska public media’s “unique value” for rural communities in the state and how it “operates independently of CPB.”

“[NPM] is the backbone of our state’s emergency alert system, and they have gone all-in on delivering quality coverage of youth sports,” Flood said. 
Nebraska Public Media broadcasts and streams local high school and college sports, including from the Nebraska School Activities Association and the University of Nebraska and Creighton University. It also issues essential vital alerts for severe storms and other emergencies. A cut in federal funding could jeopardize those services, according to the NPM website. 
Flood added that he would “ensure [Nebraska] public broadcasting network remains strong” by visiting with NPM leaders to discuss how the order impacts them. 
The Legislature’s Appropriations Committee has a proposal to increase the funding of the Nebraska Educational Telecommunications Commission, the state agency responsible for overseeing and licensing the public television and radio stations that make up Nebraska Public Media, for the next two years. 
Still, the state budget shortfall has grown by $190 million, and lawmakers have less than a month to balance the budget. The committee this week made attempts to close the gap by taking another $135 million from cash funds held by various state agencies and reducing the funding state agencies would get for the next two years.
If NPM loses funding, Bacon said, their “absence” would “leave a void.”

On April 25, the House voted 37-0 to approve a resolution calling for readiness.
House Joint Resolution 15, by Rep. Ky Holland, I-Anchorage, is slated for a hearing on Friday in the Senate Resources Committee.
“House Joint Resolution 15 came about from an early awareness this winter about the very dry conditions that we were witnessing in Southcentral Alaska,” said Holland, speaking to the House.
“A really key part of this resolution is a recognition of how important it is that we do the outreach and we encourage the preparation by residents to be able to be more aware of what they can do to protect their own homes through the Firewise program,” he said.
He added that it’s particularly important for Alaskans to be aware that many of the state’s residential areas have a single way in and out.
“That single route is all that’s going to be available for both our fire response apparatus to get in, as well as for anyone who’s trying to evacuate to get out,” he said. “And we only have to look back at some very tragic, large fires we’ve seen in the last five years that have been exacerbated by these problems of the limited ingress and egress routes to realize how important it is for us to assess those areas.”

A Williams County child who was not vaccinated is believed to have contracted the illness from an out-of-state visitor, the department said Friday. The child is in isolation at home.
Health officials are contacting people who may have had contact with the child and advising people who are not vaccinated to quarantine.
The threat to the public is low due to a majority of North Dakotans being vaccinated against the disease, according to the department.
Molly Howell, immunization director for HHS, said vaccination is the most effective defense against contracting measles.
“Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination is safer than risking measles illness,” Howell said. “The MMR vaccine has been safely used in the United States since 1973.”
Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash.
“Anyone with symptoms consistent with measles should call ahead before visiting a clinic to avoid exposing others,” she said.
The department said there is no specific medical treatment for measles, but antibiotics may be used in cases that have developed a secondary bacterial infection.  
People who were vaccinated as children and adults born before 1957 are considered protected.
The department said two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing infection. The vaccine is recommended for children at 12-15 months and a booster between 4-6 years old.
The department also recommends that families and individuals consult with their health care provider to discuss immunizations.
North Dakota has an 81% MMR vaccination rate among toddlers, and a 90% rate among kindergarten students for the 2024-2025 school year. 
According to public health data, a 95% vaccination rate is generally needed to prevent wider spread in communities.

(Photo provided by Brian Gabriel)Last summer, a quiet revolution unfolded on the shores of the Kenai Peninsula. A group of setnet fishermen — barred and facing economic ruin from their traditional fishery to protect dwindling king salmon — stepped into a new role: scientific collaborators. Testing set-beach seines as an alternative to gillnets, they proved something remarkable. Not only did they catch abundant sockeye; but, without exception, every king salmon encountered swam away unharmed.  
This wasn’t just conservation — it was partnership. These fishermen didn’t just follow protocols; they refined them in real time, applying generations of knowledge about tides, fish behavior, and gear mechanics. The results? A resounding proof of concept that protecting kings and harvesting sockeye need not be mutually exclusive.  
Yet today, this breakthrough risks becoming a footnote. The Alaska Board of Fisheries insists more data is needed before expanding the program — a cautious stance that ignores both the urgency of the crisis and the ingenuity at hand. Here’s what they’re missing: This experiment isn’t just about science. It’s about survival — for fish and fishermen alike. 
Two tests, one solution
The set-beach seine trials face twin imperatives:  

 Biological success – does it spare kings? Early data: emphatically yes.  
 Economic viability – can fishermen earn a living doing it? Unknown — to be determined.  

This second question is where bureaucracy fails. The options being considered by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for the continued experiments treat economic outcomes as an afterthought, as if conservation can succeed without buy-in from those who work the water. Setnet families have already sacrificed their fishery for kings. Now they’re being financially pressed even more as they strive to build its replacement. The board recently failed to take prudent action. Despite conclusive data, it failed to adopt a viable regulation, asked that more data be collected, and yet refused, when asked by fishermen, to provide any enabling guidelines to the Department of Fish and Game regarding how to proceed to gather that data.  The confusion created by the board has left the department in a delicate predicament: stating it can issue permits but must restrict, or even prohibit  the sale of fish — which flies in the face of common sense, not to mention, elementary economics! 
A ready workforce, a wasting opportunity
The solution is staring us in the face. Work with the fishermen who have brought this concept to the table. Implement their creative solutions to expand the study and allow the sale of fish sufficient to recover the expenses of doing the hard work of continuing the set-beach seine study. Six to eight permit holders working in groups for the next two seasons could definitively:   

increase by many times the data on live king release success and  survival;  
pioneer efficiency tweaks only fishers would spot; and  
document real-world methods to use, problems to solve, costs and profits — the make-or-break metrics. 

Without this, we’re conducting half an experiment. If the economics don’t work, this is just academic theater. We’ve got the skills to make it viable. But for that to happen, we would have to be given the chance.  
The clock is ticking
Every summer without action deepens two crises:  

ecological – kings continue to decline while a proven alternative gathers dust and  
human – fishing families sell permits, leave the industry and take their irreplaceable knowledge with them.  

Gov. Mike Dunleavy and Fish and Game Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang could:  

 Issue six to eight experimental set-beach seine permits to organized fishermen groups. Action would have to be taken now; there is little time left for the fishermen to prepare for this vital work this season. 
 Allow the commercial sale of sockeye catch by the fishermen to pay for the cost of doing the work and demonstrate the true viability for the future.  
 Formalize co-management, embedding fisher expertise in study design.  

This isn’t about relaxing conservation — it’s about accelerating it with the people who matter most. The kings need allies. The fishermen are ready. All they need is permission to get back to work.

(Photo courtesy of the House of Representatives)In a near-unanimous vote, the Florida House gave final approval Friday to a bill tightening restrictions against state employees’ participation in political campaigning.
The bill, HB 1445, is narrower than what the Florida House first proposed. The lower chamber wanted to bar state employees from soliciting contributions for political parties, committees, or candidates during working hours.
The Senate changed that language, replacing it to prohibit contribution solicitations that are coercive, explicitly stating that state employees suggesting someone make a political donation is OK under the bill.
The language lawmakers agreed upon also stops state employees from participating in any political campaign, not just those for elective offices, when they’re supposed to be working.
Throughout the legislative session, the involvement by state officials in Gov. Ron DeSantis’ political campaign against last year’s failed ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana and restore abortion access prompted legal challenges came under scrutiny.
The move to restrict politicking from state employees came after NBC News first reported that state employees in the governor’s office called lobbyists to request donations for a political committee aligned with DeSantis as he and First Lady Casey DeSantis hinted that she was considering a run for governor.
Although the proposal from Republicans Rep. Debbie Mayfield of Melbourne and Sen. Erin Grall of Vero Beach is on its way to the governor’s desk, DeSantis has already said he would veto it.
“They’re pulling it out of their rear ends and trying to jam it through this process. Over my veto pen,” DeSantis said of the proposal during an April 15 press conference in Pensacola.
DeSantis’ main criticism of the bill at the time involved a provision requiring agency heads to live in Tallahassee, which the governor referred to as a “swamp.” However, the final version cuts off reimbursement for agency heads to travel to Tallahassee. For example, state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo lives in Pinellas County.
Final passage of HB 1445 came well into the evening of the 60th day of the legislative session and with little debate. Mayfield reminded the chamber that the sole vote against the bill when the chamber first passed it on April 16 came from Delray Beach Republican Rep. Michael Caruso, a staunch DeSantis ally.
Caruso was also the sole vote against the bill on Friday.
Two provisions that remained intact in the compromise between the House and Senate require people appointed to universities’ boards of trustees and the board that oversees Florida’s public higher education institutions to live in the state or have graduated from the specific school they serve, or from any state university for the statewide board.

But that’s just the start of a $25 million-plus public investment on the main business corridor of a community known historically as a landing place for the state’s immigrant population.
Leaders of the Adelante II initiative gathered Friday at the 24th and N Streets plaza and offered a progress report, this time sharing a stage with a host of elected officials and business representatives and reinforcing a theme of collaboration.
“Together we’re bringing the heart of our community forward — adelante,” said Itzel Lopez, CEO of the Latino Economic Development Council, a lead partner on the project.

Currently a paved parking lot that shifts to fiesta grounds on certain occasions, the plaza is to be transformed via a $25 million state award from the North and South Omaha recovery grant program. Its projected opening is in 2027.
Douglas County and the City of Omaha each committed $500,000 from pandemic funds to the effort as well.
Key features include an amphitheater, stage, playground areas, open lawn, shaded family gathering area and signature art. 
The plaza makeover is the anchor of the Adelante initiative, which includes other components:

Before the year’s end, project leaders expect to have secured a site in the district for a multi-tier parking garage, with ground floor retailers, that will more than replace parking currently at the plaza lot. 
Following that will come new sidewalk, streetscape and wayfinding improvements along the main 24th Street corridor to help create a uniform vibe from Q to F Streets, Lopez said.

Lopez said her organization is hoping to raise additional funds for other improvements to the corridor, including a building that would house the LEDC, employment and other programming.
Overseeing the Adelante II redevelopment is Canopy South, a nonprofit that calls itself a “community quarterback.” 
In addition to the 24th Street area improvements, Canopy South is leading the Q Street Collaborative initiative, which received a separate $39 million from the North and South Omaha recovery grant program for several other projects in South Omaha. 
In all, the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in January 2024 awarded 130 groups and businesses a total of nearly $235 million through the North and South Omaha grant program. 
Cesar Garcia, CEO of Canopy South, said the City of Omaha is handling the acquisition of Adelante’s new garage site that is to offer parking for shoppers and workers of the area. He said choices have been narrowed to a few and negotiations are ongoing.
He said the plaza is a city-owned public space and will remain so once the plaza is revamped. Programming at the plaza likely will be a collaboration between the city and community organizations, Garcia said, though details are being worked out.

Also speaking at the Friday event was Douglas County Board Chair Roger Garcia; Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert; Omaha Public Power District CEO Javier Fernandez; South Omaha Business Improvement District President Ross Pesek; Nebraska Department of Economic Development’s Javier Saldaña and LEDC President Armando Salgado.
Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, former State Sen. Tony Vargas and Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes were among several dozen people who gathered at the plaza for entertainment by Mariachi music and dancers. 
Among others were City Councilmen Pete Festersen and Ron Hug;  U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.; Denise Powell, who has announced her candidacy for Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District as a Democrat; merchants and community members.
“The Latino community is at the heart of South Omaha’s story, and today we celebrate that legacy,” said Canopy South’s Garcia, stressing that the improvements are for all of Omaha and tourists to enjoy. 
“This is about investing in places that create the future we want for generations to come.”

Georgia chair because he has experience running in statewide elections and an ability to rally donors. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder (File)The Democratic Party of Georgia is set to elect a new state chair on Saturday to compete against Republican-controlled state and federal governments.
A new leader will be selected by the Georgia Democrats to replace Atlanta U.S. Representative Nikema Williams, who resigned in March following internal pressure from key members of her party, including U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff, who expressed doubts about her ability to devote sufficient attention to promoting the party’s platform.
Ossoff plans a bid to retain his Senate seat in 2026 and he expressed his desire for a change in party leadership after the Democrats’ poor performance up and down the ballot in last year’s election. 
President Donald Trump’s administration’s reshaping of the White House agenda looms large in the wake of his return to office, which raises questions about the role of Democratic party leadership in winning close elections.
Seven candidates are competing for the Democratic Party of Georgia chair and plan to deliver speeches in Atlanta seeking support for their bid to lead a party that recently enjoyed historical success with two Democratic senators winning the 2020 election as well as the state’s pivotal role in putting former President Joe Biden in the White House.
The field of candidates hoping to lead Georgia Democrats includes Gwinnett County state Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, former Augusta Mayor Hardie Davis and Rome City Councilwoman Wendy Davis, and perceived frontrunner Charley Bailey, a former candidate for attorney general and lieutenant governor.
The current party chair Matthew Wilson said Democrats are excited about the state committee meeting on Saturday. 
He said they have seven great candidates running for chair, a treasurer’s race, and other votes to determine key strategies. 
“The party is primed to stand up against Republican policies rolling out from Washington, D.C.“The benefit to being a big tent party like the Democratic Party is  that we have lots of different voices from all corners of the political spectrum. We’ve got conservatives, we have moderates, we have liberals, we have progressives, and it is going to be a big job for the new chair to make sure that we are united moving forward in a strategy that centers, again, what matters most, and that’s electoral victories,” Wilson said.
The 2026 election will include races for the 236-member General Assembly, U.S. Senate as well as constitutional officers including governor after Republican Brian Kemp is ineligible for a third term.
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said there is a built-in advantage for incumbent state officials since 2023 legislation allows top Georgia lawmakers to set up their own political action committees during the legislative session.
Democrats have signaled the importance of the next chair by making it a full-time role, especially with many statewide positions and key Senate races up for grabs in Georgia, Bullock said.
The success of Democratic candidates will depend on their ability to coalesce behind a strong candidate and avoid bitter primaries, he said. 
“Its potentially going to be a big year in Georgia giving  Democrats a shot at winning some of the statewide constitutional offices,”. “They haven’t won an open seat statewide constitutional office in this century.”
Bailey is the perceived favorite to become the next party chair because he has experience running in statewide elections and an ability to rally donors by not having certain skeletons that would be easy for Republicans to take advantage of, Bullock said.
“He can learn from the challenges that he had to overcome as a candidate,” Bullock said. “ He is advising others who maybe have not had the kind of scrutiny that a person gets when they start running statewide so he can give advice in terms of here’s some things you don’t want to say you believe in.”
Brian Robinson, a Georgia Republican strategist, said Democratic candidates will need to overcome the perception that Georgia is well-run by Republicans. Democrats could sway voters by taking advantage of national issues such as Trump’s poor approval ratings on the economy as he’s followed through on plans to impose steep tariffs. 
A new Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found that a majority of registered Georgia voters currently disapprove of Trump’s policies on the economy, tariffs, NATO and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs. The poll, however, revealed the support for Trump’s policies were sharply partisan, with 85% of surveyed Republicans approving compared to 97% of Democrats opposed.
“Republicans in Georgia are going into 2026 with a lot of things out of their control,” Robinson said.  They’re going to  nee focus on the things they can control: get out to vote, raise money, and pick candidates who can win. But we know that there’s a headwind for the party in the White House.”
“If Trump’s approval rating is the low 40s or high 30s, that’s a prime opportunity for Democrats in the state, if they can have discipline to pick good candidates who don’t scare the middle, don’t scare independents, and can win (support) from some swing voters in the metro Atlanta area,” Robinson said.
The big question for 2026 is whether Kemp enters the GOP field of potential challengers to Ossoff’s re-election bid.
“Is Brian Kemp heads and tails the best choice for Republicans as the most competitive candidate?” Robinson asked. “Yes, absolutely and anybody who says different is not a serious person to talk about politics.”
“But that second tier of GOP candidates will become the first tier at that juncture,” Robinson said. “They will get nominated, and they will have a lot of money behind them from a lot of organizations.”
State Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones, an Augusta Democrat, said the next party chair needs to be able to work closely with the local parties. 
“I think the key is to work with the county parties and make sure you have a good brand name as far as 2026 is concerned,” the Augusta Democrat said. “ I think all of them are basically committed to that.”
Sandy Springs Democratic Sen. Josh McLaurin is optimistic about the party having a groundswell of support for officials fighting for party ideals. 
“They want to see energy, the Democratic base does, from its leadership, because what we don’t want is to treat this like it’s just normal politics, like the Trump deportations and the tariffs and all of this is just kind of business as usual,” McLaurin said.

Community groups, labor unions, student and faith communities rallied across Vermont and around the nation on May Day, commemorated as international workers’ day in a demonstration of mass solidarity.

Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerWILLISTON — Immigrant rights, trans rights, worker rights and support for Palestinians were forefront at a May Day rally in Williston Thursday evening. Organizers estimated 2,500 people marched to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s facility on Harvest Lane and then to Hannaford Supermarket in a peaceful protest that condemned recent actions of President Donald Trump’s administration.“I’m here because I believe in social justice and human rights,” said Joanna Cole, a former state representative who lives in Shelburne. She came to participate in the rally with her partner, Sarah Flynn, outside the ICE facility.“I do not want any immigrants forced out, especially illegally,” she said, referring to recent student arrests and ICE raids in Vermont. “I think it’s horrible so many people are being kidnapped off the street and being thrown in jail.”“It smacks of Hitler in Germany and of McCarthyism in the U.S. and I don’t want to be any part of it,” Cole added.Community groups, labor unions, student and faith communities rallied across Vermont and around the nation on May Day, commemorated as international workers’ day in a demonstration of mass solidarity.From the ICE data center in Williston to the Statehouse in Montpelier and beyond, Vermonters denounced “billionaire profiteers” and actions of the Trump administration that has launched a concerted effort to dismantle government and the rights of workers, immigrants and other vulnerable groups nationwide.As Cole spoke, drumbeats and chants on Williston Road heralded the arrival of a large march organized by Migrant Justice joined by multiple labor and advocacy organizations. “An injury to one is an injury to all,” read the handmade banner held by three people up front flanked by another three people holding Palestinian flags and one waving the stars and stripes.“We are here at ICE, the same people who took our brother Mohsen, who we freed yesterday,” said an organizer wearing a red and white kaffiyeh, a scarf often worn to show solidarity with Palestinians.During a speech she called for “No ICE and no deportations” amid loud cheers outside the red brick federal building where a handful of federal workers stood guard in full uniform with marked cars during the peaceful rally.Student supporters, hospital union leaders, a representative from Vermonters for Justice in Palestine and another from the FreeHer campaign gave short speeches in front of the federal building, punctuated by drum beats, chants and cheering from the large group.Jacob Berkowitz, president of UVMMC Support Staff United at the University of Vermont Medical Center, said he joined the rally to “stand up and speak for those that cannot,” such as immigrant workers, those who are poor and those who face violence everyday.
While Trump has been in power for just more than 100 days, his mass deportation plan has had significant impact in Vermont, from the recent arrest of eight migrant dairy workers at Berkshire and the detainment of a Palestinian student in Colchester to revoking the legal statuses of some resettled groups, freezing funding for refugee support and jeopardizing local jobs. And it continues to try to prevent a detained Tufts student’s return to Vermont.“This lays bare a fundamental truth. Prisons and police have always been weapons of class warfare,” said Jonathan Elwell, an organizer from FreeHer Vermont, a prison abolition group, in a brief speech. “No matter how hard the goons who run them try to frame prisons as apolitical tools of public safety or spout progressive promises of rehabilitation, we know the truth. They are always deployed against those who are dispossessed, differentiated or dissident.”Protesters waved signs signaling their opposition to Trump, ICE, prisons, capitalism, the muzzling of free speech and democracy: ‘Power to the workers, not the billionaires,’ ‘ICE is terrorism,’ ‘Respect the Constitution.’ ‘Good dogs eat fascists,’ read a cardboard sign attached to a brown dog’s harness.“I’m making it a point to go to a lot of protests just because I do not like what the Trump administration is doing. I am especially upset about deportations without a trial,” said Monica Hawkes, who came from Jeffersonville to join the Williston protest.Continuing on, the march ended around the boundaries of the Hannaford Supermarket on Marshall Avenue around 8 p.m., with Migrant Justice advocates and allies demanding the grocery chain join the Milk With Dignity campaign in a continued effort to fight for the rights of farmworkers.Migrant Justice launched the campaign in 2019 to promote fair wages and dignity on farms and demands that Hannaford improve conditions on the farms that supply its dairy products. The nonprofit representing immigrant farmworkers statewide filed a complaint in the Netherlands last month outlining human rights violations in Hannaford’s supply chain. The U.S. grocery chain is a subsidiary of Ahold Delhaize, a Dutch-Belgian multinational company. “I think a huge place that unites us is that we are all working people and we are powerful if we are in solidarity,” said Bex Love from Northfield.Love sported black-and-white cow print and helped hold up a towering makeshift white cow, made to support Milk With Dignity, with her friend Izzy de Buy Wenniger, of Burlington, at the picket line near the grocery store. There, security guards blocked marchers from going on the property.On the sidewalk outside, speakers once again lined up to share their thoughts.Thousands in Williston marched in support of immigrant and farmworker rights on May Day 2025. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDigger“Under Donald Trump, our lives are under attack,” said a Franklin County farmworker who identified herself as Maribel. Her comments, spoken in Spanish, were translated by Will Lambek, a spokesperson for Migrant Justice. Despite working long, hard hours, farmworkers like herself are not given the dignity of a fair wage, health care or safe housing, Maribel added, and corporations like Hannaford continue to exploit them.As she called for solidarity on the packed sidewalk in the fading light of the waning day, allies applauded, a child drummed on an upside down paint bucket, and a passing car honked in support.Read the story on VTDigger here:  From ICE to Hannaford: Vermonters rally on May Day for human rights and social justice amid escalating Trump administration attacks, rollbacks.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/May-Day-2025-1-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 20:03:59.962112

Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, talk while walking in the hall of the Capitol on May 1, 2025. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers on Friday approved an Ethics Commission budget full of major policy changes — though they abandoned a controversial proposal that would have imposed a deadline for ethics complaints.
The budget, totaling nearly $1.4 million, was forwarded to both chambers for a vote that morning following final amendments from a six-member conference committee. The Senate approved the budget by a 44-2 vote, while the House passed it 71-19.
The Ethics Commission sought money in Senate Bill 2004 for a fourth staff member for the 2025-2027 budget cycle, which the Legislature ultimately rejected. That employee would have focused on education and communications. The Senate initially approved the request, setting aside $250,000 for a two-year salary, benefits as well as other costs. The House later axed this funding — a move the conference committee sustained.
Legislators did agree to fund a $50,000 case management system to help the commission track filings, which staff say will help them work more efficiently.
Other noteworthy provisions in the budget include a handful of changes intended to fix bottlenecks in the Ethics Commission’s complaint process.
Some lawmakers who worked on the budget this session complained that the commission sometimes takes years to resolve complaints. Some complaints are more than two years old.
Meanwhile, the commission has received a flood of new filings since Jan. 1. As of April 28, the board had received 68 complaints since the start of 2025. That’s more than the commission received in all of 2024.
Some, though not all, of the policy changes in the budget were originally proposed in bills that died earlier this session, like House Bill 1360 and House Bill 1505.
Generally, the Ethics Commission is opposed to adding policy into the budget bill, said Executive Director Rebecca Binstock. She said she worries some of the provisions will add red tape to the commission’s work, though she expects at least a few to help the board’s work go more smoothly.
“The commission’s position has always been that we prefer a clean budget,” Binstock said.
Ethics commissioners say bill would impose an arbitrary cutoff for investigations

One provision in the bill approved Friday would allow the commission to informally settle ethics complaints directly with the accused. Previously, the commission could only act as a mediator to broker informal resolutions between the accused and the filer — which sometimes doesn’t work if that filer’s demands were unrealistic. The commission must attempt to mediate between both parties first, however.
Another requires the commission to develop time management standards for processing complaints, which Binstock said the commission supports and wanted to pursue anyway.
Until Thursday, the budget included a mandate for the Ethics Commission to dismiss complaints after 180 days. It was added as part of an amendment brought by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, who said it is needed to make sure the commission’s investigations don’t drag on indefinitely.
“It’s just a matter of fairness to the accused,” Nathe said previously. “They shouldn’t have to sit there with this hanging over their head for years at a time.”
The Ethics Commission opposed the six-month window as a threat to its work, arguing that many complaints cannot be effectively probed within that timeframe and that it would incentivize people accused of ethics violations to obstruct investigations to run out the clock.
In place of the deadline, the conference committee added a clause that states an individual accused of a violation may petition the commission at any time to dismiss the complaint against them. The Ethics Commission will have to draft a policy implementing this language.
Some lawmakers said the root of the commission’s backlog of complaints stems from a lack of resources, and that the budget does not address this problem.
Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, unsuccessfully brought a budget amendment to more than double the commission’s staff, arguing that the funding is necessary for the body to do its job effectively.
“I think the activity thus far indicates that we have a lack in that we don’t have another staff person,” Mathern said on the floor Friday. “However, we’ve made some progress, and hopefully by the next time we meet next session, we can get that other staff person to help us all do a great job.”
Voters created an ethics commission in North Dakota. Then the Legislature limited its power.

A separate amendment brought by Rep. Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo, requires the commission to publish an annual report providing details about its work, including the number of complaints filed and what the commission has done to resolve them.
The bill also allows people accused of violations to discuss complaints against them.
Another section protects lawmakers from being prosecuted with a conflict of interest crime for voting on bills so long as they observe the proper legislative conflict of interest rules or heed the informal advice of an Ethics Commission staff member.
The bill advances to Gov. Kelly Armstrong for his consideration.

Nevada was awarded about $15 million in funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) this year, but had not received the remaining 10% of its allocated funding before the Trump administration fired every employee responsible for administering the funds.
The Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday they would release the nearly $400 million in LIHEAP utility assistance funding that had not yet been distributed to states by Thursday.
“I am committed to ensuring that our programs run efficiently. With today’s announcement, all available LIHEAP funding for this fiscal year will be released. We will continue to work with our state, tribal, and territorial partners to ensure this funding reaches eligible families,” said Andrew Gradison, Acting Assistant Secretary for Children and Families.
Utility advocates and Democrats in Congress raised the alarm about last month, warning that the gutting of federal workers and the program could leave the funds in limbo.
After news of the mass firing last month, Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen and several other Democratic senators sent a letter to HHS demanding the agency release all of the LIHEAP funds that Congress has appropriated.
“By terminating all 23 employees tasked with overseeing LIHEAP, it is now unclear how these funds will be administered. In our view, that is unacceptable,” read the letter. “Failure to disburse these funds constitutes an illegal impoundment of bipartisan, congressionally appropriated funds and will put the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable people in America at risk.”
Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program received more than half its funding from LIHEAP last year, making it a vital source of utility assistance funding for the state.
Last year, Nevada received more than $17 million in LIHEAP funding to help 12,000 low-income households in the state keep their power on. A portion of those funds were also used to help low-income households pay for upgrades that improve energy efficiency and lower power bills in the long term.
The Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program paid out another $13.8 million in benefits last year from state revenue generated from Nevada’s Universal Energy Charge which helped another nearly 6,000 households pay their utilities. 
Still, as temperatures rise there is a growing demand for utility assistance funding in the state. Nearly 32,000 Nevadans had their power disconnected by NV Energy for nonpayment in 2024, according to data from the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
In Southern Nevada, where temperatures reached 100 degrees or higher for 64 consecutive days in 2024, air conditioning is a life-saving necessity.
The state’s ability to provide energy assistance could be reduced even more in 2026, as LIHEAP was among 60 programs President Donald Trump asked Congress to defund in a budget request Friday.
Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program begins July 1st and applications are accepted through June 30th. Applications are evaluated year round or until funding is exhausted. Eligible households receive an annual, one-time per year benefit customarily paid directly to their energy provider.
Those interested in applying for LIHEAP can visit energyhelp.us or call the National Energy Assistance Referral (NEAR) hotline toll-free at: 1-866-674-6327.  
Households can easily identify if they may be eligible for assistance by using the LIHEAP Eligibility Tool on energyhelp.us.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thermostat-1024x735.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 20:03:59.962112

‘Penguin Day’ returns to the Capitol
Just before gaveling into session on Monday, state lawmakers had a chance to meet with a delegation of visitors from South Africa — by way of Mystic.
Green/blue and Blue/blue, two African penguins from the Mystic Aquarium, served as animal ambassadors for the aquarium’s annual “Penguin Day” at the state Capitol. The names of the pair derive from colored beads on their wings that staff use to identify individual birds.
Each of the penguins took turns with a caretaker outside of their mobile enclosure, posing for pictures with staff and lawmakers. Petting was not permitted, for the animal’s safety. State Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, beamed as she leaned in for an up-close greeting with Green/blue. “What a great day,” she exclaimed.
Welander said her eldest son, who recently graduated high school, is planning to study marine biology in college. “If I missed Penguin Day, he’d never forgive me.”
The penguins’ visit also offers aquarium staff a chance to engage with lawmakers about various legislative issues and to raise awareness for their animal rescue program. Lobbyists for the aquarium were also on hand, answering questions and snapping photos.
“We advocate for a lot of the positive environmental measures, things like decreasing plastic pollution, public education, encouraging public advocacy and responsible environmental stewardship along the coastlines,” said Allison Tuttle, the aquarium’s chief zoological officer.
While wild penguins live almost exclusively south of the equator, Mystic’s animal rescue program fields over 100 calls each year for stranded seals, sea turtles and other marine animals in Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York.

Special Education
The Special Education Committee on Tuesday approved two identical bills that would adjust the funding model for special education across the state and provide more oversight of the programs.
The bills are the newly formed committee’s signature pieces of legislation this session and aim to address what districts say is a lack of state investment in special education and problems for students in the programs. The committee passed a House and Senate bill, which will next be considered by the Education Committee. Lawmakers will decide later which is the best avenue for passage.
The bills had some changes following a public hearing last month. The Office of the Child Advocate would have a bigger role in oversight of special education programs and cost-setting. The costs would also be set on an individualized rate rather than a universal rate. A previous moratorium on new special education providers has been removed, and there is a requirement for the state to conduct randomized audits of restraint and seclusion use for special education students.

Gun violence prevention
U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal held a press conference Friday after President Donald Trump removed federal funding for programs supporting gun violence prevention. Though Connecticut gun reform and mental health organizations are not currently on the list of programs that are receiving the funding cuts, Murphy and Blumenthal expressed concern that funding removal could affect Connecticut.
“You are not serving any constituency by cutting funding to these groups,” Murphy said, adding, “We are going to litigate this issue.”
They were joined by Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam, Rev. Henry Brown of Mothers United Against Violence, a gun violence support group, and Andrew Woods and Johanna Schubert of Hartford Communities that Care, a nonprofit focused on community support and violence prevention.
“This is a defunding of public safety in communities like Hartford,” Arulampalam said, adding “any one shooting in the city is too many.”

Contraception for minors
The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill enabling minors to receive contraceptives, prenatal care and pain management during labor without the consent of an adult. The bill has undergone significant changes since its original draft, which was met with fierce criticism by organizations like the Family Institute of Connecticut. Originally, the bill would have removed state regulations on abortions and abortion clinics — which, among other things, required doctors to report data on abortions to the state, prohibited third trimester abortions and allowed healthcare providers to refuse to perform an abortion for moral or religious reasons. All of these provisions were removed.
“There is no longer anything about abortion in this particular bill,” Democratic Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey of Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, said Thursday. McCarthy Vahey cited the 2023 Connecticut school health survey, which shows that 28% of high schoolers have had sexual intercourse. While over half used a condom, only 1 in 10 used both a condom and some form of contraception.
Rep. Nicole Klarides-Ditria, R-Seymour, said the goal of the bill was to ensure that young people could get medical care without being afraid of repercussions. “I would venture to say this bill is going to prevent pregnancies. It will prevent abortions because it’s going to enable our minors to get contraception to prevent pregnancies,” she said.
The bill also precludes medical personnel from sharing information about the services a minor received without the consent of the minor patient. Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said the bill’s open-ended language could open the door to preventing doctors from sharing information about other issues. He proposed an amendment that would require a parent or guardian — or, in some cases, another trusted adult over the age of 21 — to be notified after a minor received an abortion. The amendment was rejected, and the bill was adopted 117-27.

Birthing centers
The House this week voted to pass a bill that requires the state’s Office of Health Strategy to craft a strategic plan for increasing the number of birthing centers and hospitals in areas with high percentages of Medicaid recipients and limited access to facilities.
The OHS commissioner must report to legislators by Jan. 1, 2027 on recommendations and state appropriations needed to stand up more birthing centers and hospitals in underserved areas.
An amendment adopted during the bill’s debate eliminated a mandate that the state Department of Social Services increase Medicaid reimbursement for doulas as part of the Connecticut’s bundled maternity payments.
The issue of maintaining or adding birthing services in underserved areas has received considerable attention. In late 2023, state officials approved the closure of Windham Hospital’s labor and delivery unit, ending a three-year saga that pitted community members against one of Connecticut’s largest health systems. A study this year concluded that opening a freestanding birthing center in that area is not feasible because there isn’t enough demand to sustain it.
In 2023, the legislature passed a law to allow freestanding birth centers in the state, and to date there is just one, located in Danbury. Each center needs about 115 annual births to break even and 500 births to be financially viable, according to industry benchmarks.

McCoy, 37 — who has been staying off the streets by sleeping in a blue bus offered by the Nomad Alliance, a nonprofit that helps unsheltered Utahns — said he was recently diagnosed with a lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He’s been told that he has maybe five to 10 years left to live, “and there’s no cure for it,” he said, so all he can do is focus on medical treatment that helps him stay comfortable through the remainder of his life.  
“If I were to lose my Medicaid, pardon my language, but there’s no way in hell I’d be able to afford any of that,” he said. “I’ve been on the streets my entire adult life. … I have a hard enough time trying to feed myself.” 
Friday’s public hearing at the Multi-Agency State Office Building in  Salt Lake City was the first of two scheduled as part of a 30-day public comment period the state officials are required to hold before submitting a proposed waiver to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in June. 
Advocates sound alarm as Utah looks to impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion

That waiver, as currently drafted, would ask President Donald Trump’s administration to allow Utah to reinstate work requirements on the state’s Medicaid expansion program. Currently, about 75,000 adult Utahns are enrolled in the state’s expansion program, which allows Medicaid eligibility to Utahns whose annual income is up to 133% of the federal poverty level (roughly $20,800 for an individual or $42,760 for a family of four, according to national thresholds). 
The waiver would permit a list of exemptions to the work requirement, excluding those working at least 30 hours a week, those who are 60 or older, pregnant, physically or mentally unable to meet the requirements, parents with a child dependent under the age of 6, among others. And it would allow Medicaid recipients to claim “good cause” for circumstances not on the exemptions list, such as hospitalization or a death in the family, according to state officials. 
However, of those 75,000 adults enrolled, an estimated 7,900 would not fall under an exemption and would be subject to work requirements if the state submits the waiver and it’s approved by federal officials. That means those 7,900 could lose their Medicaid coverage if they don’t start working or submit documentation to the state that they’re applying for at least 48 jobs during a three-month period. 
Along with McCoy, concerned Utahns and low-income advocates came to Friday’s public hearing to express concerns about the Utah Department of Health and Human Services’s decision to re-submit the Medicaid work requirement waiver. 
Previously, when the state’s first waiver was submitted in 2020, the work requirement was approved at the time under Trump’s first administration, but just months later it was suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, in 2021, when Utah’s waiver was up for renewal, former President Joe Biden’s administration required the state to remove that work requirement.

Now, with Trump back in the Oval Office, Utah DHHS agency leaders have decided to resubmit it. The move adds Utah to the list of states looking to impose work requirements on certain Medicaid recipients under a Republican-controlled Congress and Trump, wanting to encourage people to find work and reduce their reliance on public assistance. 
However, several low-income advocates told state officials during Friday’s hearing that mandating work requirements on vulnerable populations — especially those who are medically frail or experiencing homelessness — would at best saddle them with unnecessary paperwork they don’t have time for and at worst cause them to lose their medical care. 
Kseniya Kniazeva, founder and president of Nomad Alliance, said many of the homeless Utahns her nonprofit helps rely on Medicaid coverage. 
“Without Medicaid, they would suffer,” she said, worrying that imposing work requirements would mean the difference between life and death for many of Utah’s homeless. 
“The population that I serve cannot work 30 hours a week while they’re on the streets,” she said. “If they could, they would get a job and they would get health care through their job. That’s why Medicaid is here, it’s for people who cannot work because they have chronic health conditions or mental health conditions.”  
Kniazeva said for many Utahns experiencing homelessness, almost all of their energy is spent on dealing with keeping a roof over their head and staying safe and healthy — not looking for a job or jumping through administrative hoops to keep health care coverage.

“We cannot remove crucial health care for this population,” she said. “Forcing them to apply to 48 jobs in a three-month period? … When their whole entire life is consumed by trying to find food and water and a bathroom today, how are you supposed to think about applying for jobs so you can keep your medical care?” 
Most of them don’t even have phones, she said, let alone access to a computer. 
“For the love of God, please,” Kniazeva said. “This is not what Jesus would do.”
Stephanie Burdick, consumer representative on the state’s Medical Care Advisory Committee, said even though the state’s proposed waiver includes a list of exemptions, still requiring Utahns to prove they qualify for an exemption creates too many administrative obstacles for vulnerable populations. 
“This mass surveillance of poor people and mass surveillance of sick people, it infringes on basic American rights,” Burdick said, her voice straining with emotion. “Why should they have to prove to you that their health conditions meet your definition (of qualifying for a work requirement exemption)?”
Burdick questioned why the Utah DHHS is moving forward with re-submitting the waiver when it has not received a new mandate from state legislators to do so. If state leaders really want to increase employment for Utahns, she said they should focus on voluntary job programs, not make health care coverage contingent.
“Do not force this kind of government bureaucracy on Utahns’ health care,” she said. 
Jennifer Strohecker, the state’s Medicaid director, repeatedly thanked those who attended Friday’s meeting and said their input would help inform the final version of the state’s waiver application. 
“These enrich our process and allow us to really consider multiple angles when evaluating this policy proposal,” she said. 
Friday wasn’t the only opportunity for Utahns to weigh in to the proposed waiver. There’s another public hearing scheduled for May 14 at 4 p.m.. at the Multi-Agency State Office Building, located at 195 N. 1950 West in Salt Lake City. Utahns can also submit comments on the state’s website or email them to Medicaid1115waiver@utah.gov.

Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan died Friday morning at 91, more than two decades after leaving office for the last time and 12 years after his release from federal prison.

He died just one day after being put into hospice care in his native Kankakee.

Ryan, a Republican, served  one term as governor from 1999 to 2003, and spent the last decade or so of his life speaking about and ultimately writing a book on his 2000 decision to put a moratorium on Illinois’ death penalty and then commuting the sentences of 167 death row inmates in the state’s prison system to life sentences.

“I can’t really believe that there’s ever gonna be a system devised where an innocent person couldn’t be executed,” Ryan told Capitol News Illinois in a 2020 interview. “You gotta have a perfect law if you’re gonna have ... death as a penalty. So I just figured the best way to do it was to do away with that opportunity.”

But Ryan’s time as governor — and his entire 35-year career in politics — was ultimately overshadowed by his time as secretary of state in the 1990s. During his two terms leading that office, Ryan oversaw a license-for-bribes scheme that led to the deaths of six children in a fiery vehicle explosion and 79 federal indictments, including his own.

Before that, Ryan served as lieutenant governor alongside Gov. Jim Thompson, whose law firm would later represent Ryan pro bono in his corruption case. He also spent two years as Illinois House speaker, capping a decade in the General Assembly.

A pharmacist by trade, Ryan began his political career in the late 1960s on the Kankakee County Board.

License-for-bribes conviction

The former governor spent nearly six years in prison and on home confinement after his 2006 conviction on corruption charges stemming from an investigation into a freak accident on a Milwaukee expressway in 1994.

The Willis family, who’d been driving from Chicago to a vacation in Wisconsin, were engulfed in flames when their minivan exploded after a taillight fell off a semitrailer truck and punctured the van’s fuel tank. The explosion killed the six Willis children, while the Rev. Duane Willis and his wife Janet were badly burned.

An investigation into the crash revealed that other motorists had tried to warn the semi driver about the dangling vehicle part, but he didn’t understand English, even though federal law requires truck drivers be proficient in English to get a commercial license.

After Wisconsin authorities passed along the information to the Secretary of State’s office, an internal investigation found the truck driver may have paid a bribe to get his license. But Ryan squashed the probe and fired the investigators.

The feds, however, picked up the investigation while Ryan was running for governor, finding a systematic operation in which bribes paid for commercial driver’s licenses were funneled into Ryan’s campaign fund.

Even as secretary of state employees were being indicted in what came to be known as Operation Safe Roads, Ryan claimed to know nothing about the scheme and was elected governor over Democratic then-U.S. Rep. Glenn Poshard in 1998.

But as the investigation reached a fever pitch and the cloud of suspicion over Ryan grew, he chose to not run for a second term as governor in 2002. That paved the way for Democrat Rod Blagojevich’s victory over Republican Jim Ryan, who suffered from sharing a surname and party with the then-governor.

Ryan was indicted in 2004, convicted in 2006 after a lengthy trial and went to prison in 2007 following a monthslong appeals process, making him the third Illinois governor to serve time. Several years later, Blagojevich would follow.

Death penalty moratorium

Since his 2013 release from prison and subsequent stint on home confinement, Ryan dedicated the last years of his life returning to a subject he’d become passionate about as governor: the death penalty.

Ryan parlayed his speaking engagements into a book, co-authored with a former Chicago Tribune reporter and published in 2020. The book, titled “Until I Could Be Sure: How I Stopped the Death Penalty in Illinois,” detailed the former governor’s debates and deliberations leading up to his decision to put a moratorium on the state’s death penalty in January 2000.

Just before leaving office three years later, Ryan commuted the death sentences of 167 Illinois prisoners, which garnered international attention.

Ryan’s ascent to the governor’s office coincided with emerging DNA evidence technology and a wave of exonerations across the country, including in Illinois. The state would later become known as an outlier for false confessions and exonerations. But at the time, Ryan’s stance was controversial in a tough-on-crime era of politics.

In his 2020 interview with CNI, Ryan said the majority of his staff tried to dissuade him from making moves on the death penalty, which wouldn’t be officially abolished in Illinois until 2011.

But Ryan said the uncertainty of decisions made under the death penalty system bothered him, especially in the wake of the exoneration of death row inmate Anthony Porter in February 1999, when Ryan was a month into his term as governor. Porter was freed after journalism students at Northwestern University uncovered evidence of his innocence.

“The whole system was just prone with error,” Ryan said. “It’s just — you got error in every corner.”

Former Illinois House GOP Leader Jim Durkin, who in 2023 stepped down from the post Ryan held decades before, told CNI he’d gotten to know the former governor better in his later years through Ryan’s son Homer.

Durkin said when he’d meet up with the Ryans in Kankakee while campaigning for fellow House Republicans, their lunches would often be punctuated by locals who'd wanted to say, “‘Hello, governor’ — not ‘Hello, George’ ... They loved him.”

“He made a mistake and he did his time,” Durkin said. “And he didn’t express or show any bitterness toward anyone involved in his case. Just wanted to get on with his life. That shows a strong man who takes responsibility.”

Illinois Senate Minority Leader John Curran, R-Downers Grove, echoed Durkin’s accolades that Ryan was a “master of bridging the gap” both between Republicans and Democrats and between organized labor and management.

“He was a bold leader who wasn’t afraid to reach across the aisle and bring people together for the greater good,” Curran said. “His investments in infrastructure, technology, and education to help create a brighter future for Illinois will long be remembered.”

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.
23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Phil Pouech, D-Hinesburg, speaks as the House Transportation Committee takes testimony at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, February 12, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIdaho is not a place, as far as I know, that comes up in the Vermont Statehouse all that often. But the House Transportation Committee has been considering a proposal first enacted in that state — and that supporters here say would make it safer to ride bicycles in busy areas.Rep. Phil Pouech, D-Hinesburg, is urging his fellow committee members to add language into this year’s miscellaneous motor vehicle bill that would allow cyclists to treat stop signs like yield signs — essentially, letting them coast through intersections when no drivers or pedestrians are present. The policy is often called an “Idaho stop,” because the Gem State (yes, that’s what they call it) was the first in the country to put such an idea on the books. Today, 11 states have enacted similar laws, according to Local Motion, a Burlington-based advocacy organization for cyclists.Pouech’s amendment would also allow bikers to follow pedestrian signals, instead of normal traffic lights, at intersections. Both that measure, and the “Idaho stop,” were part of companion House and Senate bills introduced earlier this year that have not advanced on their own. The motor vehicle bill, S.123, has already cleared the Senate and is now being considered in House Transportation. On Friday, the panel heard from several witnesses who said they support tacking Pouech’s proposal onto the DMV bill, which is one of the “must-pass” bills each year. Jonathon Weber, programs director for Local Motion, told the committee many cyclists already do what the amendment proposes to legalize because they know that it makes them safer.Following pedestrian signals allows cyclists to clear through intersections before vehicles start moving, reducing the likelihood of crashes, he said. Meanwhile, he said, letting cyclists avoid stopping at an intersection — and in many cases, avoid having to unclip their shoes from their pedals as a result — would also reduce the time that they spend in such crash-prone areas. Weber pointed to research published last year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation, which found that existing stop-as-yield laws were associated with reduced crash rates, particularly at intersections in suburban communities.“We believe that Vermonters shouldn’t have to break the law in order to perform a safe and helpful behavior out on the streets,” he said Friday.Much of the language in the annual DMV bill is proposed by the state Agency of Transportation — and the legislation contains many relatively minor changes to motor vehicle laws. The agency isn’t taking a position either for or against Pouech’s proposal, he said Friday.House Transportation is expected to take up the issue again Tuesday, he said, when it could vote on his amendment and then on the bill as a whole.— Shaun RobinsonIn the knowAbout 95% of people incarcerated in Vermont will one day leave prison.

Along with creating new state-level flood response and preparedness and responsibilities, the bill has a variety of measures geared toward helping those communities keep as much of their revenue as possible.The bill would also create a new “municipal grand list stabilization fund,” which for five years would reimburse municipalities for lost property taxes on flood buyouts, since properties purchased by communities for flood mitigation or recovery represent a loss in potential property tax revenue. It also puts in place a new state-led flood buyout program to replace or add onto the flood buyouts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Another provision would allow communities to keep a larger percentage of their local options tax, 75% rather than 70%, Waszazak said. The remaining portion goes into a state fund that provides tax relief to municipalities for state-owned property.Read more about what municipal leaders in central Vermont have to say about the bill here. — Erin PetenkoVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Vermont’s House Transportation Committee weighs bicycle safety proposals.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/house-transportation-5-20250212.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 19:06:08.418813

At an ecosystem meeting, officials explain that progress and decisions about continued protections have been put on hold pending confirmation of Brian Nesvik, Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  
The post Yellowstone grizzly managers — dispersed and reduced by DOGE — shine little light on delisting battle appeared first on WyoFile[...]","CODY—Two days of discussion about the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population passed before anyone inquired about the status of the species the meeting was focused on. 
Under a court order in January, the Biden administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service proposed continuing with Endangered Species Act protections in the Yellowstone region and all other portions of the Lower 48 where grizzlies reside. Shortly thereafter, pro-delisting leadership was installed by the Trump administration: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director who’s now nominated to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
For months, there’s been little official word about what’s going on with Fish and Wildlife’s proposal, though the agency delayed the deadline for the public to provide feedback. In Cody this week, the topic was barely broached at the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s semi-annual Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee meeting. It only came up because a member of the public, local resident Dewey Vanderhoff, asked “where we’re at in the overall picture with delisting” during the meeting’s closing minutes.

Hilary Cooley, Fish and Wildlife’s grizzly bear recovery coordinator, pointed out the proposal on the table — and said she couldn’t say much more. 
“As far as what happens with that proposal, we’re waiting for leadership to be installed,” Cooley said. “Acting leadership is not interested in making decisions right now.” 
As of Friday, 27 pending nominees appeared above Nesvik on the U.S. Senate’s Executive Calendar, which suggests the wait could drag on. The Trump administration also appointed another Wyomingite — mule deer advocate Josh Coursey — to a high Fish and Wildlife Service post, albeit one that doesn’t require Senate confirmation. 
Even if expected Fish and Wildlife Service leaders don’t attempt to pull back the existing continued-listing proposal administratively, legislative efforts are underway to delist grizzly bears, including from Rep. Harriet Hageman.

Wyoming-sanctioned grizzly hunting bill fails to overcome concerns about Endangered Species Act violations 



The gathering of Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear managers in Cody differed from typical meetings because of the turmoil and turnover the Trump administration has brought to the federal government via its Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Most federal members of the committee attended remotely due to travel and spending restrictions. There were also new faces, goodbyes and discussion about what the diminished Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team can realistically accomplish going forward. 
“One way or another, the USGS is not going to have the resources they’ve had in the past,” Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Administrator Ken McDonald told the group. “At the November meeting, we better have a plan for the following spring.”
Biologist Matt Gould, the study team’s new leader, told the group that, despite changes in capacity, the committee’s science arm will continue with grizzly monitoring, data collection and administering the new population model to assess bear numbers — last estimated at 1,050 in the ecosystem’s core.

The Cody meeting was the last as a full-time employee for Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team Leader Frank van Manen. The longtime federal biologist retired earlier than expected, though he is staying involved in an emeritus role. He helmed the group for 13 years.
“I know there are some challenges ahead, but keep up the good fight,” van Manen told the group. “This endeavor has been successful for 50 years, for a good reason: Agencies working together.”

(Getty Images)Advocates for people held in an immigration detention center in Estancia, N.M. say sewage is again backing up into their cells, and they do not have access to clean drinking water.
The Town of Estancia, where the prison is located, posted on social media on Monday asking residents to conserve water. The well serving the community is not producing enough to meet demands, Torrance County Manager Jordan Barela said in a statement on Thursday.
Tiffany Wang, an attorney with the Oregon-based Innovation Law Lab who regularly speaks with people held inside the Torrance County Detention Facility, told Source NM they’ve reported since Monday there has been “absolutely no access to water,” leaving them unable to flush toilets or take showers and exacerbating illnesses and hygiene issues.
“Several reports indicate that stagnant human waste has sat in sites across the facility and that people are resorting to desperate measures such as fasting in order to avoid defecating and defecating on paper plates to put into the trash instead of using toilets, which they are unable to flush,” Wang said.
In addition to detaining migrants, the Torrance County lockup holds people facing federal charges and serves as the county’s jail. It’s owned and operated by private prison company CoreCivic. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracts with the county to provide space to hold detained people, and Torrance County contracts with CoreCivic to facilitate the agreement with ICE. President Donald Trump is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with CoreCivic and other private prison companies, Stateline reports.
Spokespeople for CoreCivic and the county government on Friday acknowledged a shortage of water, but denied allegations that the prison doesn’t have any or that sewage is flooding the cells.
Ryan Gustin, senior director of public affairs for CoreCivic, told Source NM any claim that Torrance has been without running water since Monday “is completely false.”
While the prison changed its operations to reduce water consumption, Gustin said, drinking water is always available in the cell pods and staff have given people bottled water. Wang told Source inmates have told her that this is limited to two bottles per day.
“At no point have those in our care been without drinking water,” Gustin said. He said laundry and showers have been “placed on a schedule” but remain available to everyone.
The ongoing conservation measures are meant to ensure the town doesn’t reach critically low levels in its water storage tank, Barela, the county manager, told Source NM. She said the prison’s water tank “has never been empty,” people held there “have had enough water to meet basic water needs during this time,” and the well is being repaired.
Wang said the possibility that some limited amount of water remains in the facility’s tank “does not change the truth that people detained inside TCDF say they have now gone since Monday without running water to meet their basic needs.”
CoreCivic, county deny evacuation
Innovation Law Lab on Tuesday informed ICE El Paso Field Office Director Mary De Anda-Ybarra about specifically where the problems are happening inside the prison, according to emails the group shared with Source NM. De Anda-Ybarra responded the same day by asking for more information and then the next morning, told them “we are looking into the matter.”
Wang said following the law lab’s letter to the ICE field office, the detained men told her officials  evacuated them from one dormitory with a history of sewage flooding. She said prison staff are making detained people clean the feces themselves without personal protective equipment.
CoreCivic and the county also deny these allegations. A spokesperson for ICE did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
“There are also no sewage flooding issues, nor have we had to relocate any residents,” Gustin said.
Barela said she is unaware of any “systemic issues” when it comes to sewage backups in the prison, and maintenance issues are addressed as they come up. “To my knowledge, TCDF has rectified all building maintenance issues within a reasonable time frame after becoming aware of the concerns,” she said.
Wang said Torrance has a “well-documented record of failing plumbing infrastructure,” and shared a map of flooding issues in nearly every cell pod.
“Claims that CoreCivic and Torrance County are unaware of systemic sewage flooding issues are disingenuous and false,” she said.
In interviews with legal advocates and researchers, people detained inside Torrance have described cells “inundated with dirty water” in 2024; entire cell pods flooded with raw sewage in 2023; and broken sinks and water fountains in 2022. New Mexico’s Congressional delegation cited these issues and others when they repeatedly asked former President Joe Biden to close Torrance, but he refused.
‘A public health crisis’
Wang said people detained in Torrance already have various illnesses that would be exacerbated by a lack of potable water, including a gallbladder infection requiring an operation, epilepsy, vision issues and diabetes.
Gustin said CoreCivic hasn’t received any reports of incarcerated people or staff becoming sick as a result of the water problem.
Wang said the county and CoreCivic’s comments “fly in the face of numerous testimonies from detained individuals and their families stating that the facility has been without water for flushing toilets or showering since Monday.”
“It is remarkable, but unfortunately not surprising, that CoreCivic and Torrance County officials are currently attempting to claim that plumbing and water issues are unfounded or have been resolved,” she said. “It speaks to the impunity and dishonesty with which CoreCivic, ICE, and Torrance County collaborate to operate TCDF.”
Wang said it’s shameful that CoreCivic and the county “continue to profit at the expense of the health of detained individuals and the wellbeing of the town of Estancia.”
“ICE and CoreCivic should halt further transfers of people into TCDF, which is in the midst of a public health crisis, release all the people currently detained inside, and finally shut TCDF down,” she said.

(Photo of black bears in North Carolina by NC Garry Tucker/ USFWS)Several black bears spent the winter tucked into dens in northeastern Iowa, which wildlife experts say is a “step up the ladder” toward an established breeding population of bears in the state. 
Black bear sightings in the region have been fairly regular over the past decade or so, but with the prospect of more bear sightings to come, Vince Evelsizer with Iowa Department of Natural Resources said he wants to make sure Iowans “get off on the right start.” 
“That starts with all of us having a better understanding of bears, and what motivates them,” Evelsizer said. 
DNR met with police departments, sheriff’s offices, conservation boards and other officials in northeastern counties, to help prepare them in the event of a bear-related call. 
Evelsizer said this type of education around bears will lead to a better understanding of how to deal with bears, “for the sake of the bear and for human safety sake.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The department has also partnered with the organization BearWise, to provide messaging on how to live with bears. Bear Wise, which was developed by state agency bear biologists, has basic tips for residential and outdoor bear interactions. 
People in residential areas in “bear country” can do things like take down bird feeders, secure any food left outside, including pet food and garbage, and clean their outdoor grills when bears are active, from spring through fall. 
Bears have incredibly strong senses of smell and can smell a tasty snack from more than a mile away, according to BearWise.
Loud noises and big arm movements are the best way to scare a black bear away if it turns up in a yard or across a hiking trail.
Black bear attacks are “extremely rare” according to BearWise, but Evelsizer said it’s best to “give black bears space.” 
Over the years, he said the department has reported a handful of instances of bears hit by cars or shot in the state. 
There are no legal protections for bears in Iowa, though a bill was introduced in the House this year to create a program for hunting and trapping black bears, and establish penalties for the unlawful taking of a bear. 
“It is up to the people of Iowa to decide if they would like to see protection (for the bears) or not,” Evelsizer said. 
A natural resurgence 
Black bears, which can be cinnamon, brown, blonde or black in color, were once common across all of North America. European settlement in the country eliminated much of the population, and drove the bears to more remote areas, away from human settlements. 
Gradually, however, the populations have come back. Iowa’s neighbors to the north, Minnesota and Wisconsin, are now home to an estimated 16,000 and 24,000 black bears, respectively. 

Bear fact: Bears are not considered “true hibernators” because their body temperature only drops about 12 degrees during their winter slumbers, according to BearWise. During the 4-6 months the bears spend snuggled in a den, they do not eat, drink or go to the bathroom. The National Park Service reports that during a bear’s torpor, they can still wake suddenly if they sense danger. 

Evelsizer said the bears began to reside in the driftless region of the two states, which is why some have wandered into Iowa. 
“It’s interesting that this is actually going on in our modern world,” Evelsizer said. “After so many years … the book is still being written.” 
Black bear visits in past years have mostly consisted of males crossing over during mating season and then looping back up to Wisconsin or Minnesota. Evelsizer said the handful of black bears that stuck around this year through Iowa’s winter have already emerged from their winter torpor. 
Evelsizer said overwintering females would be the next step toward an established breeding population in Iowa. 
Iowa is still dealing with individual bears at this point, with an average of about five bear sightings a year and eight sightings last year. 
“My hunch is that they’re more adaptive than we think, and that we may see more than we thought we ever would,” Evelsizer said.

Flood-related expenses and lost revenue could resound for years — and not just in Barre.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  As Barre voters prepare to weigh in on this year’s budget, flood woes from years past still linger.","Kaycen Hedges tries to clear mud from Third Street in Barre on Thursday, July 11, 2024, after overnight flooding. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe most fateful decision made about Barre City’s fiscal future might not be made by voters at its Town Meeting Day election on May 13. Rather, it’s the decisions made by state lawmakers, federal agencies and the Trump administration at large that have already affected Barre’s coffers as it slowly pulls itself up from two major flood events. “Our recovery and the impacts (are) not felt across just one year. We need sort of an off-ramp, and we need multiyear assistance,” Barre City Manager Nick Storellicastro said. “I mean, that obviously didn’t translate to this year.”Voters will soon decide whether to support the $14.8 million 2026 budget proposal, representing a property tax rate increase of 5.87%. Barre City voters moved its Town Meeting Day to May in 2024 to better fit the back end of the state Legislature’s calendar. The budget Storellicastro helped to prepare this upcoming fiscal year had to work without the roughly $1 million in state flood aid that the city received in 2024. Barre City was one of the hardest-hit communities in Vermont during the 2023 flood event, and was hit again, less hard, the following year.So far, the city has received only $50,000 in direct operational assistance for this upcoming fiscal year, which runs from July 1 to June 30, from the state. “We’re never going to turn down money from the state. But obviously, the difference between $50,000 (and) a million is a big deal,” he said. “We probably could have used a number with six figures in it, it would have been something more meaningful.”Barre City officials ultimately chose to make up its budget deficit by cutting its bulky waste removal service, leaving positions unfilled and raising certain city fees and taxes, among other measures. The city also benefited from a small boon: Longtime Barre resident Eugene Cozzi bequeathed a large trust to the city upon his death in 2024, $75,000 of which will be used this year to help support cemetery operations, Storellicastro said. However, the fate of a bill that would provide flood-affected municipalities some fiscal relief is still up in the air. H.397, currently in the Senate Government Operations Committee, has a variety of measures geared toward helping communities keep as much of their revenue as possible. Rep. Teddy Waszazak, D-Barre City, said that as the state’s financial situation has gotten worse due to Trump administration cuts across the country, he worked on H.397 to “put smaller pieces” of funding together for municipalities. He said the bill would create a new state-led flood buyout program to replace or add onto the flood buyouts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “We need to build up our state systems,” he said. “We can’t assume FEMA will be there,” as the Trump administration has cut back on key FEMA programs. The bill would also create a new “municipal grand list stabilization fund,” which for five years would reimburse municipalities for lost property taxes on flood buyouts, since properties purchased by communities for flood mitigation or recovery represent a loss in potential property tax revenue.Storellicastro told the Senate Committee on Government Operations on Tuesday that 60 Barre property owners have applied for buyouts. Of those, Barre has approved only 27. “Barre City is four square miles,” he said. “Anytime we give up a parcel to a FEMA buyout, that is gone forever from property tax revenue, from development, from housing, from whatever you want to call it. So we only decided to move forward with very targeted buyouts of clusters along the river because those properties have mitigation value to the city as a whole.”Another provision in the bill would allow communities to keep a larger percentage of their local options tax, 75% rather than 70%, Waszazak said. The remaining portion goes into a state fund that provides tax relief to municipalities for state-owned property.Town officials beyond Barre support those changes, while acknowledging they have limitations. Tom Leitz, municipal manager for Waterbury, said the extra 5% in local options tax would mean an additional $60,000 in revenue for the town. “I think we’ll be back asking the same questions of the Legislature in a year or two, but I’m still really happy to get an additional 5%,” he said. “That’s a big win for us.”Liz Scharf, Middlessex Select Board chair, said the town was in the process of approving 12 buyouts that could translate to a loss of $60,000 in property tax revenue per year. “It’s not something we can rely on in perpetuity,” because of the five-year time limit, she said. “But it obviously would be helpful to have that.”Yet the town’s challenges go well beyond buyout funds. Middlesex is still waiting on more than $5.4 million in FEMA reimbursement for the emergency repairs it made for the 2023 flood. The money has been coming in “at a snail’s pace,” she said. The delay has left Scharf with a daunting fiscal bind. “Usually, a town like us would have $200,000 to $400,000 of reserve funds, just for things, right? Like, ‘Oh, yeah, this broke down and we didn’t have the money for it.’ We have zero reserve funds,” she said. Meanwhile, “everything in our town is falling apart,” she said: the town hall, the town shed, a town-owned truck. Just recently, she got a picture from the town’s foreman of a road that appears to be sinking toward a gorge, the kind of damage that could cost thousands to repair. The town has been borrowing funds to keep up, but Scharf is worried its credit will max out soon.“I don’t know what to do in the next storm,” she said. “I don’t know how we’re going to pay for the next road repairs, because we just don’t even have the money to front it.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  As Barre voters prepare to weigh in on this year’s budget, flood woes from years past still linger.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/barre-storm-folo-9-20240711.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 19:06:08.418813

Tucked in between the conservative, rural north Georgia mountains and the more liberal Atlanta suburbs, Cherokee has a relatively large population that is relatively conservative, which makes it a gold mine for Republicans running statewide races. Last fall, Cherokee voters gave now-President Donald just under 70% of their ballots, more than 112,000 in total, helping him flip the state back for Republicans after it narrowly went to former president Joe Biden in 2020.
That’s why it was a little unusual to see top Georgia Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Harold Jones and state Sen. Jason Esteves, who recently launched his 2026 gubernatorial campaign, speaking to large crowds at events in Cherokee Thursday.
Getting Shigley with it

Jones, who represents Augusta, made the trek to downtown Canton to show support for the woman he hopes will be his newest colleague. He was joined by other top Democratic senators including Sens. Josh McLaurin, Elena Parent and Sheikh Rahman as well as state Rep. Shea Roberts.
Debra Shigley, a Harvard-educated attorney, small business owner and mom of five announced Thursday she is running to replace Republican state Sen. Brandon Beach, who was picked by Trump to become the next U.S. Treasury Secretary.
Shigley said her campaign will emphasize honesty, transparency and kitchen table issues.

“That’s the voice I’ll bring to the state senate, a voice that knows what it’s like to juggle diaper changes with Zoom calls and soccer practice, a voice that understands struggle, believes in solutions and refuses to give up on Georgia families,” she said.
But before Shigley can deliver her first floor speech, she’ll have to fight off the winner of a crowded Republican primary. The candidates so far include Cherokee County Commissioner Steve West, trucking company founder Jason Dickerson, Army veteran and small business owner Grant McGarry and firefighter Brice Futch.
The eventual GOP primary winner will enter the general with a distinct advantage – the district, which includes parts of Cherokee and north Fulton counties, heavily favors a Republican. Beach, a stalwart conservative and Trump ally, won the district with around 70% of the vote last year.
Democratic leaders say despite that disadvantage, they feel good about Shigley’s shot.
That’s because it’s an off-year, special election, which will likely take place during summer vacation season. That is likely to mean a low turnout race, and Democrats are betting their base, peeved at the news out of the federal government, will be more energized to cast their ballots.
“I think the way the winds of the country are blowing right now, and also in Georgia, is to see that the Republicans are really not about helping families and doing things for people,” Jones said. “So, number one, I think that’s the reality, and then number two, we have a great candidate. So when we put those two things together, I really do believe it’s flippable.”
Where’s Barry?
  Congressman Barry Loudermilk
Democrats have held rallies with crowds numbering in the hundreds in south Cherokee, including outside the Woodstock office of Republican Congressman Barry Loudermilk.
On Thursday evening, Cherokee Democrats and the Atlanta-North Georgia Labor Council hosted a mock town hall in Loudermilk’s name at a Woodstock church. The congressman’s place was taken by a cardboard cutout of Waldo, the elusive red and white stripe-wearing fellow from the Where’s Waldo books, with Loudermilk’s face pasted on, the joke being that Loudermilk can’t be found by his constituents.
More than 200 people packed into the Allen Temple AME Church to ask questions, not of Loudermilk, but of Esteves and McLaurin as well as fellow Democrats Sen. Sonya Halpern and Rep. Lisa Campbell.
The questioners came from a left-of-center perspective, largely expressing fear and anger at federal policies ranging from immigration and economics to health care and the environment.
A major theme was the demand that lawmakers do more to counter Trump’s agenda.

Shawn Kwak, a naturalized citizen and former Republican, said even though he served in the U.S. Navy, he cannot prove his citizenship because he doesn’t have a birth certificate, which impacts his ability to vote and get a driver’s license.
“I don’t see the fight in the Democratic Party,” he said. “I’m holding back a lot of anger right now. My family and thousands of people across this nation are right now struggling to hold on, to hide, to keep themselves out of the line of fire. I’m not afraid to stand up. I fought for this nation. I was a Republican. I am armed and I’m military-trained. We are out there this weekend fighting again. I don’t see you guys out there with us. I hear you talk a lot of talk, but I don’t hear the issues that are important, that we are getting attacked right now. I’m afraid that if they question my rights, I can’t prove my citizenship anymore.”
Speaking after the event, Esteves acknowledged the frustrations some Democrats have with the party and said he will focus his campaign on policies that will help Georgians.
“The Democratic Party is not on the ballot, Jason Esteves is on the ballot,” he said. “So I’m going to focus on my race. I’m going to focus on making sure that we have candidates up and down the ballot that are focused on the issues that Georgians care about. And ultimately that comes down to keeping and growing of hard-earned money in people’s pockets. And I’m not going to focus on what’s happening at the national level. Obviously what’s happening in D.C. with Donald Trump and Elon Musk is causing a lot of chaos down here. And we’re going to have to navigate through that. But at the end of the day, what Georgians want is someone who’s going to focus on them.”
Dems moving north?
  Sen. Jason Esteves. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Esteves said he was encouraged by the big crowd in Cherokee and that he sees chipping away votes in red counties as critical for Democrats running statewide.
“What we have to do is make sure that we’re meeting voters where they are across the state, regardless of what the vote totals were in prior elections and talk to people about the issues that they care about,” he said.
Democrats like Biden and Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff who have won statewide races racked up big numbers in Atlanta and its suburbs like Cobb County, Cherokee’s neighbor to the south.
Once a Republican stronghold, Cobb has moved more to the left over the last few decades as younger people and more minorities moved in seeking good schools and affordable homes within reach of Atlanta’s jobs and amenities.
That same dynamic could be just getting under way in Cherokee, said Nate Rich, chair of the Cherokee County Democratic Party.
“Cherokee’s definitely a slower burn because we are like that next layer of counties out beyond the north metro arc, right? So I don’t know that Cherokee’s gonna be this dramatic collapse of dominoes that Cobb was back in ‘16 and ‘18, but we’re doing the work now in preparation. We’ve got a lot of organization, we’ve got a lot of good energy, we’ve got some great candidates, so we’re feeling really good about it.”
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said that cautious optimism may be warranted.
“Looking at what’s happened over the last, not quite a generation, in terms of presidential voting, virtually all the precincts in the southern third of Cherokee have become a little more Democratic,” he said. “It’s not so consistent in gubernatorial elections from 2010 to 2022, but still, generally, South Cherokee is becoming a bit more democratic now. Still, it is, overall, a huge win for Republicans, but yeah, Democrats are showing some strength in the southern part of the county.”
Speaking to reporters at the Democratic town hall, Woodstock Republican Rep. Charlice Byrd said not so fast. She said it’s true that a lot of new people are moving into areas like Woodstock, Acworth and Canton, but the county still has a strong Republican majority and will for the foreseeable future.
“It shifts to the left, it shifts  to the right, then it comes back to the middle, then it goes one way or the other again,” she said. “I feel very confident that Cherokee County will remain red for quite a while yet. I mean, we haven’t seen anything drastic. There was a drop in when we did the redistricting, the lines changed a little bit, but it’s still pretty red. And as I see it now, whoever is running as a Republican, they need Cherokee County.”

Byrd and fellow Woodstock Republican Rep. Jordan Ridley, who are seen as on the more conservative side of the House GOP, sat in the front row for the Democratic town hall.
“Their big thing is like, ‘Barry, why are you hiding?’ We want to make sure no one thought we were hiding,” Ridley said. Ridley added that he doesn’t think that is a fair assessment of Loudermilk.
Ridley echoed Byrd’s assessment of the parties’ future chances in Cherokee and predicted Shigley will have a more difficult race than she and Senate Democrats might think.
“That’s going to be a hard hill to climb, and if for some reason they do catch lightning in a bottle, they get extremely lucky, we come back to a full election cycle in ‘26, and they’re not going to hold that seat,” he said. “So if they do get lucky, they’re gonna lose it in 12 months. They know that, we know that, so I don’t see them putting a lot of money in – let’s just be realistic, if you’re winning by 70% the other party’s not going to hold it, it’s going to flip right back.”

“There is nothing more personal than an individual’s genetic information,” said Idaho’s Republican Attorney General Raúl Labrador in a March 24 consumer alert, “and allowing that to be sold off to the highest bidder raises serious consumer protection concerns for privacy. I want to make sure that 23andMe customers in Idaho have every opportunity to protect their genetic data.”
North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, agreed in a March statement.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” Jackson said. “You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
 What state and federal laws protect the privacy of your genetic data?

Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.












There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company




23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”

 HIPAA doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, , Idaho, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
Labrador similarly encouraged Idahoans to look at all genetic testing companies to see if they store a customer’s data.
Consumers may use the Consumer Reports App to request that direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies, including 23andMe, delete any personal data, the Idaho attorney general’s consumer alert said.
“Consumers who have submitted genetic samples to other companies should determine if their genetic information has been stored by that company,” the alert said. “If your data has been stored, you may request the company destroy any stored information either through the Consumer Reports App or through the company itself.”
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.

 What states are doing to regulate genetic testing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.

Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images) A central Iowa investment advisor accused of defrauding investors in a million-dollar Ponzi scheme is appealing the revocation of his business licenses.
Des Moines investment advisor Cory J. Dawkins of Elite Wealth Partners is asking a Polk County judge to review and overturn a decision by the Iowa Insurance Division to revoke his license and registration as an investment advisor and insurance producer.
Dawkins is also seeking an immediate stay of the license revocations, at least until a final decision is rendered in the case, to avoid “substantial and irreparable harm” to his business and reputation.
In court filings, Dawkins says he has spent his entire professional life in the insurance, banking and financial services industry.
“Since the Iowa insurance commissioner’s investigation began, my business has suffered an approximate 87% revenue drop,” he told the court. “Several negative articles about me have appeared online since the commissioner’s investigation began. These articles present a distorted view of the situation by falsely suggesting that clients have lost all their money and portraying me as the mastermind behind the investments.”
Dawkins said there is a “significant possibility his clients many recover their investments” and that he had “no decision-making authority in the underlying investments at issue.” He adds that if he is barred from the securities industry, efforts to recover his clients’ money  will be “substantially curtailed.”
Without court intervention, he argues, he will be forced to close his business, will be unable to pay the $2.3 million in restitution ordered by the division, and will have to file for bankruptcy protection.  He adds that with his professional identity being “intrinsically linked” to his role as a financial advisor, the revocation of his license “would cause me severe psychological distress that extends far beyond financial considerations.”
A hearing in the matter is now scheduled for May 30, 2025. The Iowa Insurance Division is seeking dismissal of the case, arguing that by statute Dawkins had 30 days to seek judicial review of its decision, but filed his case after 33 days had passed.
SEC said business was ‘actually a Ponzi scheme’
In 2022, the Iowa Insurance Division formally charged Dawkins, Elite Wealth Partners and EWP Permian Basin Fund II with securities fraud; performing unregistered activity as securities agents; committing acts that constituted grounds for discipline as investment advisors; and fraud or dishonest conduct as demonstrated through incompetence, untrustworthiness and financial irresponsibility.
According to the Iowa Insurance Division, Dawkins offered high-risk, unsecured investment opportunities that were not in his clients’ best interests. The division alleges the scheme was launched sometime before May 2019 when Dawkins spoke to a Polk County couple about investing in EWP Permian Basin Fund II, whereby the couple’s money would be used to back a company that was purportedly purchasing oil wells.
According to the division’s findings of fact, EWP was not actually buying wells and had no assets to secure the notes that were issued to investors. The representations made to the Polk County couple and to other subsequent investors by Dawkins were “untrue” and amounted to securities fraud, according to the division.
EWP, the division found, was set up as a vehicle through which people could invest in an entity called the Heartland Drilling Fund. Dawkins failed to review Heartland’s financial statements and “exhibited significant uncertainty” as to which oil and gas interests were actually held by Heartland, the division found.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the division noted, would later conclude that promised returns to investors “were little more than an illusion and were actually a Ponzi scheme.”
Dawkins and Elite Wealth collected thousands of dollars in fees related to their investment transactions. Dawkins, however, had a conflict of interest by acting as both an investment advisor and a self-interested promoter of EWP, the division concluded. He also was alleged to have steered investors to a “very high risk” entity called the Carson Oil Field Development Fund II without disclosing all of the risks involved.
By 2021, the division found, Dawkins and Elite Wealth should have known they were recommending investments “that had numerous characteristics of a fraudulent Ponzi scheme,” with initial investors being paid from proceeds generated by newer investors.
Division cites ‘heartbreaking’ effect on investor
One of the alleged victims in the scheme was a 19-year-old Iowa State University student whose father had recently died of cancer. The division said it found her subsequent testimony about her dealings with Dawkins to be “simply heartbreaking.”
The young woman, whose name is redacted from public filings in the case, had invested $188,000 of her father’s money with Dawkins, according to the division.
“We needed money to pay for a funeral,” the woman testified at a hearing. “We simply had my dad’s body in a freezer for two weeks. So, we were really struggling, and we owed a whole bunch of our family members money. And we just kind of proceeded because we were so desperate for funeral money to pay for his gravestone and to pay the mortgage on our home … I guess my dad already chose that investment. So we just kind of went with whatever he had … And if he trusted Cory with that market on that, then I just went ahead with it.”
Dawkins, the division found, later accepted no responsibility for steering the student toward the high-risk investment, stating that Dawkins “absurdly claimed” that although he was a fiduciary, his introduction of the EWP investment opportunity to the student was not a recommendation of any kind.
In its findings of fact, the division said it found Dawkins’ testimony at a hearing on the matter to be “wholly untrustworthy, leaving us with the unmistakable impression that Dawkins was willing to say practically anything” to avoid accountability.
The division stated that losses by 15 investors, including interest, totaled $2,371,618.
Iowa Insurance Commissioner Douglas Ommen revoked the investment advisor registrations of Dawkins and Elite Wealth, revoked the insurance producer licenses of Dawkins and Elite Wealth, and permanently barred EWP from issuing or offering securities of any kind in Iowa.
Ommen also ordered EWP to pay $2.3 million in restitution, with $1.9 million of that amount payable immediately, and the remaining $400,000 payable no later than March 31, 2026. Ommen’s order also specifies that Dawkins and Elite Wealth are also held liable for the $2.3 million in restitution.
Dawkins has not responded to requests for comment from Iowa Capital Dispatch, but SEC records indicate he, Elite Wealth and EWP have denied all of the division’s allegations.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gavel-cash.jpg,,,2025-05-02 18:07:50.593998

(Photo courtesy the Doña Ana County Clerk's Office)Money can’t buy you love, but it can get you a $55 New Mexico marriage license this summer.
New Mexico Marriage license fees will more than double next month from the current $25 fee thanks to Senate Bill 290, sponsored by Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) during the legislative session held earlier this year. Out of the total new charge, the county clerk’s office keeps $20; another $20 will go to the state’s Children’s Trust Fund; and $15 will benefit each county’s general fund.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the bill on April 8 and the fee increase goes into effect on June 20. 

According to the fiscal impact report, the fee increase is estimated to bring in an additional $195,000 in revenue each year – including about $32,500 for the Children’s Trust Fund, which currently receives most of its revenue from special license plate sales. The fund is administered by the Children, Youth and Families Department’s Family Services Division. Trust fund grants are awarded to “community-based organizations” throughout the state working to help prevent or treat child abuse and neglect. 
Doña Ana County Clerk Amanda López Askin told Source NM that the marriage license fee has not increased since the 1990s, and previous efforts to pass an increase failed. 
“This is my seventh year that I’m starting [as county clerk]. We have been pushing for an increase that was, I think, reasonable, but also would be impactful for each of the counties in terms of their funds,” López Askin said. However, she noted: “It’s not just about increasing revenue. It’s also about collectively supporting children across the state.”
New Mexico’s license fee will still be on the lower side, compared to neighboring states such as Texas and Arizona, which both charge over $80, according to the Doña Ana County Clerk’s Office. Doña Ana County Chief Deputy County Clerk Caroline Zamora said many people from El Paso, Texas travel to her office for marriage licenses because of the cheaper fee.

David Wasinger watches the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate appears on the verge of rekindling a 50-year-old fight over the role of the lieutenant governor, triggered in part by the five hours of budget debate this week.
At the start of Thursday’s session, Lt. Gov. David Wasinger recognized himself to speak, then quoted state Sen. Joe Nicola expressing his frustration at the short time allowed to read and understand the $49.7 billion spending package.
Wasinger said he was traveling in the state during the budget debate and heard similar complaints. 
“The perceptions of the folks are the same perception that the senator has outlined,” Wasinger said. “So to give you a heads up, I will be, either yet this session be taking a far more active role, or it may happen next session, because I think some rules need to be changed within this chamber.”
Wasinger did not mention during his speech that his office budget was cut in the Senate Appropriations Committee, chaired by state Sen. Lincoln Hough of Springfield, who Wasinger defeated in the 2024 GOP primary. He lost one of the eight staff positions in his office, which is already the smallest of all statewide elected officials.
 Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, R-Shelbina, speaks during a March GOP press conference at the midpoint of the legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Friday morning, Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin — who by the rules holds the power to choose committee members, refer bills and decide parliamentary questions — used a social media post to slap back at Wasinger’s remarks.
Wasinger was out of line giving a speech in the Senate chambers, O’Laughlin said, because that is  “a right reserved for senators.”
“He advised that he would be introducing new rules maybe next session,” O’Laughlin wrote. “Uh…..no. He does not have the authority to do this because he is not a senator. He also advised that he would be using the senate caucus staff. Also no.”
If Wasinger wants change, she wrote, “one way to be helpful is to not insult the entire Senate body in a five-minute speech.”
Wasinger, like Nicola, never held public office before winning election in November. His campaign promised he would be “challenging the Jefferson City establishment” if elected but he has not attempted to exercise the kinds of powers generally inherent in the job of presiding over a parliamentary body.
In his speech from the dais, Wasinger said that while he ran as an outsider, he had remained silent because he wanted to observe the chamber.
“I didn’t want to come in and, you know, begin throwing hand grenades,” Wasinger said.
If Wasinger tries to exert some sort of authority over the Senate, he would run headlong into a five-decade old Missouri Supreme Court ruling that diminished the already meager role of the lieutenant governor. 
 “Full-time Phelps” case

In 1972, Bill Phelps was elected lieutenant governor, the first Republican to win the office since 1928.
 Lt. Gov. Bill Phelps in the official photo published in 1975. (Source: Missouri Official Manual)
He promised he would be a “full-time” lieutenant governor, despite the lack of actual responsibilities in the office. Along with being ready to take over upon the death, disability or impeachment of the governor, the officeholder is “ex officio president of the senate.” In that role, the Constitution says, the lieutenant governor may join in Senate debate when it sits as a committee of the whole and cast the deciding vote in the case of ties.
As Phelps took office in 1973, the Senate changed its rules to put all substantive powers of the presiding officer in the hands of the president pro tem, elected from the members. The rules even allowed the president pro tem to dismiss the lieutenant governor from the dais.
And when then-state Sen. Bill Cason took the gavel from Phelps over his objections on the final day of the 1973 session, Phelps took the case to the Missouri Supreme Court.
At first, the case was only over the rule allowing the pro tem to relieve the lieutenant governor of the gavel. That rule, the 6-1 court said, was unconstitutional.
The pro tem must yield, Judge James Finch wrote, when the “lieutenant governor is present and desirous of exercising his role as presiding officer of the senate.”
That didn’t end the controversy.
The opinion was issued in November 1973, just before the start of the 1974 session. The courts were forced to issue a clarification when Phelps also contended the rules giving the pro tem the power to name committees, assign bills and rule on parliamentary questions were invalid.
The court quashed that argument. The lieutenant governor may hold the gavel if he or she wishes, but cannot use any power inherent in the role of presiding officer because those duties had been assigned elsewhere under the rules.
The Senate has the power to write rules to govern its proceedings, subject only to limits in the Constitution, the court decided.
“The powers and functions referred to…are not given to the lieutenant governor in (directly by the constitutional) or anywhere else in the Constitution,” the unanimous court ruled.
In a statement Thursday afternoon, Wasinger said he hopes to reduce the amount of time “wasted on the senate floor” where “arcane senate rules stall progress on or completely block good legislation that would improve the lives of Missourians.”
His goal, he said, is to remove those impasses.
“Many other states have made reforms to their senate rules, and it is time Missouri does so as well,” Wasinger said. “This isn’t about any individual senator – it’s about a system in Jefferson City in much need of common sense reforms.”
O’Laughlin, in her response to his speech, said Wasinger needs to learn the lesson she learned, that it takes more than certainty about the wisdom of an idea to accomplish anything in the Senate.
“Lesson One: Develop a personal relationship with each senator and offer to help navigate what is an extremely complicated system,” O’Laughlin wrote. “This is how you get something done. Ultimately it’s the ONLY way.”
A mocking voice from the rank and file of the Senate showed Wasinger will have more, not less, work to do after his speech. As he closed his speech, he invited members to contact his chief of staff, Katie Ashcroft, with any ideas for reforming the rules.
State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, responded in kind on social media.
“If you have any ideas how @davidwasinger could do his job better,” she wrote, “please let Karen in my office know.”

(Photo By Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)What began as a session focused on how to spend Virginia’s projected multi-billion surplus has ended with Gov. Glenn Youngkin yanking nearly $900 million out of the state budget — bracing for the economic aftershocks of President Donald Trump’s new administration.
At the start of the 2025 legislative session both Youngkin and members of Virginia’s General Assembly had their eyes on how best to use the windfall. But after Trump took office in late January, Youngkin announced Friday that he was setting aside a $900 million cushion to prepare for potential federal impacts. 
A good portion of the money stems from cutting one-time capital projects at colleges and universities and other public facilities which Youngkin said are still in the planning stages and haven’t yet entered construction. 
Amid Trump’s cuts to federal workers, congressional plans to trim federal funding, and fresh tariffs rattling international trade, Youngkin has repeatedly emphasized “short-term risks” and “short-term disruptions” as reasons to hold back spending. 
“As President Trump rightfully resets trade imbalances and restores fiscal responsibility in DC,” Youngkin said as he announced he was signing the state budget on Friday. “Those short term disruptions, I think, require us to be responsible and not spend 100% of this forecasted surplus today.”
House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, commended Youngkin’s actions as “prudent” in a statement issued on Friday. He added that “Virginia is better positioned to weather whatever comes next.”
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surrovell, D-Fairfax expressed frustration in a call with reporters Friday afternoon. 
“I’m glad to see the governor is finally agreeing with us that the Virginia economy has some serious risk due to the actions of President Trump and Elon Musk,” Senate Surovell said on the call following Youngkin’s announcement. 
However, he criticized Youngkin for not conferring with lawmakers on his budget cuts. 
“He should have had a dialogue with us during the session so he could try to reach a mutual understanding or compromise about it, instead of showing up at the last minute, $900 million out of our budget,” Surrovell said. 
 Signed and vetoed bills 

Meanwhile, the governor may have pleased many lawmakers by deciding to sign bills he had previously tried to alter.  
When the legislature convened last month to review his amendments, they chose not to accept many of the amendments or substitutions he proposed when they sent the bills back to him for final signature or veto. They’d also accepted his recommendations in part on some of the bills as well.
“There are a lot of bills that I think are very interesting that I hadn’t seen before that we tried to make a little better,” Youngkin said. “Didn’t get the amendments passed, but I’m going to sign them because I think they actually are pretty decent bills.” 
For instance, Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico saw several of his returned bills signed to include an overhaul of Standards of Learning testing procedures and a bill to require social media companies verify the age of users and place time limits for minors under 16. Delegates Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax and Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, respectively carried the House versions of the bills.
The governor also vetoed bills that had been sent back to him with his amendments rejected. 
Such was the case with proposals from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, that would create a right to contraception in Virginia. The lawmakers have stressed in recent years that state-level protections could be needed if two U.S. Supreme Court cases upholding contraception rights were overturned. 
After the fall of Roe v. Wade, the federal case that had protected abortion access, Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting the court’s previous contraception rulings. While his counterparts have not signaled similar interest, some states have sought to restrict contraception, while others have worked to shore up protections. 
Like last year, Youngkin tried to amend Hashmi and Price’s bills to line up with the Supreme Court, which the lawmakers  said “gutted” the bills and missed the point. The Democratic-controlled legislature rejected his substitute, and he later rejected their bills altogether — just as he did this year. 
 Other budget bits

Meanwhile, on Friday, Youngkin celebrated some of the ways the state budget will support people, including investments in maternal health, which drew cheers from attendees. Both Youngkin and Democratic lawmakers had emphasized the need for legislation and funding to address maternal health disparities in the state, and the governor has already backed several bills carried by Democrats as well. 
The budget also includes $50 million for disaster response relief in Southwest Virginia and $50 million for community flood protection funding. A years-long effort — which had previously failed — to budget $50 million to overhaul Richmond’s combined sewage overflow system survived this time around. 
Following Richmond’s water crisis earlier this year, when water treatment plant failures left the region with unsafe drinking water for nearly a week, Youngkin also announced  plans to invest $25 million in drinking water infrastructure. 
He received applause from the audience when he mentioned the budget’s investment in education — $834 million in public education, which includes lifting support caps, investments for English language learners, investment in special education, and $7.5 million earmarked to help reduce child care waitlists. There’s also $134 million, he said, to fund “much deserved bonuses for our teachers.” 
Youngkin also emphasized that the budget includes funding for Medicaid — a program that may still face some jeopardy in the state amid federal actions. Should congress cut federal spending, Virginia’s 2018 expansion, which affects roughly 630,000 people, could be at risk. 
Some lawmakers have suggested that a special session might be needed to figure out how to cover those costs if that happens, while Youngkin said Friday he believes there are ways to streamline the program’s operations in the state to look for “waste, fraud and abuse.” 
As it’s his final year as governor, Youngkin said he plans to address his cuts to capital projects in a “caboose budget” later this year. In that proposal he can outline what he envisions the legislature with as they head into the  2026 legislative session under whoever the new governor ends up being. 
“We can postpone the final appropriation for these very worthy projects and enable the General Assembly to take it back up in January,” Youngkin said. “I would really like to include them in my introduced caboose budget, and then the General Assembly can get to work.”

Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) on Friday described President Donald Trump’s May 1 executive order eliminating funding for NPR and PBS. Entitled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,” the order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease current and future direct and indirect funding “consistent with my[...]","Longtime KUNM volunteer DJ Don McIver pictured hosting the station's afternoon Freeform program (Megan Kamerick/KUNM)“Unlawful” and “illegal” is how U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) on Friday described President Donald Trump’s May 1 executive order eliminating funding for NPR and PBS.
Entitled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,” the order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease current and future direct and indirect funding “consistent with my Administration’s policy to ensure that Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage.” It also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary to determine whether PBS or NPR “(or any successor organization)…are complying with the statutory mandate that ‘no person shall be subjected to discrimination in employment . . . on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.’ In the event of a finding of noncompliance,” the order continues, “the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take appropriate corrective action.”
Luján, the ranking member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Media, said in a statement the “unlawful” order, signed “in the dark of night,” will “strip New Mexicans of vital access to public programming that educates, entertains, and keeps us safe. For decades, NPR and PBS have delivered news, entertainment, and much more to New Mexicans, especially in rural and Tribal communities. Public media, like NPR, PBS, and their local affiliates, provide critical information to New Mexicans in all corners of the state — including during disasters and emergencies when our rural communities rely on public media the most.”
Moreover, Luján’s statement noted, “this illegal executive order is an attempt by President Trump to strip New Mexicans of vital public services that thousands rely on day-to-day. The President is disregarding CPB’s authority and working to prevent New Mexicans from accessing free news, educational programming, and emergency alerts. Defunding NPR and PBS will leave New Mexicans in the dark when they need information the most.”
Local NPR affiliate KUNM General Manager Richard Towne, in a statement provided to Source, agreed with Luján’s characterization of the order, writing:
“In my view, the EO does not have the legal basis for enforcement.  This is because CPB is an independent non-profit corporation, not a government agency.  The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 protects CPB against political meddling through Congressional funding for two years of funding.”
Towne notes that the CPB is currently funded by Congress “with White House approval” through Sept. 30, 2027, so Trump’s executive order bypasses Congress.
Trump’s order impacts approximately $540,000 in CPB funding for KUNM over the next two years, he said. For public radio and television together, the impact is more than $11 million over the next two years, he noted, adding: “This is not chump change.”
New Mexico PBS General Manager and CEO Franz Joachim sent Source a similar comment, also noting that Trump’s EO “is a clear violation of the 1st amendment and the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as a firewall against federal interference how our federal funding is used.” Federal funding of public media, he added, “is essential and irreplaceable. Government should fund the free distribution of information that saves lives and changes lives. 
Towne also shared a letter he received Friday afternoon from CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison that says while Trump’s executive order “is concerning, we believe it has no effect on CPB, since CPB is not a federal agency subject to the President’s authority.” As such, “CPB will not be adding any additional conditions or restrictions on our Community Service Grants. Payments will continue to go to our grantees per their grant agreements.”
Harrison’s letter also noted that a few days prior to the executive order, the Trump administration “sent emails to three members of CPB’s Board of Directors stating they are fired effective immediately. We immediately filed a lawsuit to say the Administration has no authority to terminate any of CPB’s board members. A U.S. District Court Judge ruled in favor of holding a hearing on our motion for a temporary restraining order, which seeks to block the president’s actions until the case can be fully heard. The hearing is scheduled for May 14. 
That being said, Harrison acknowledged rumors that the administration intends to try to pull back $1.1 billion from CPB’s forthcoming budget,. The CPB board met Friday to discuss these issues.
“I am proud of the resilience and dedication I have seen across the system,” Harrison’s letter concludes. “Your efforts ensure that public media remains a cornerstone of our shared democracy. Together, we will navigate these challenges, guided by our shared commitment to service, education, and community.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kunmdj-1024x473.jpg,,,2025-05-02 18:07:50.593998

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state’s attorney general called Friday for Oklahoma’s commissioner of mental health to be fired, a day after the agency she oversees warned lawmakers that it will not be able to pay its employees later this month.  
Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the governor needs to fire Commissioner Allie Friesen, who heads the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, after legislators revealed they had learned that the agency expected to run out of funds as early as Wednesday. On Friday, they said the agency shifted that payroll shortfall date to May 21.
The payroll issue is the latest in a series of reports of financial disarray and shortfalls at the agency, which has an annual budget of about $610 million and slightly more than 2,000 employees. The agency is the subject of a handful of probes, including from lawmakers, the state auditor and inspector, and a “special investigator” who will be appointed by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt.
The agency reported a $43 million deficit and requested $6.2 million to make ends meet through the end of the fiscal year, but officials haven’t been able to explain how they reached these numbers or publicly answer questions about their payroll costs, drawing the frustration of state lawmakers.

Drummond on Friday called the disarray at the mental health department a “financial meltdown” and “nothing short of government malpractice.”
“Gov. Stitt should have fired his failed agency head months ago when we first learned of her incompetent leadership,” he said in a statement. “I am calling on Gov. Stitt to immediately terminate Commissioner Allie Friesen and seek guidance from industry experts so he can appoint a new leader who is up to the job.”
Stitt appointed Friesen to the role in January 2024 and said Friday that she continues to have his support. Friesen has blamed many of the financial issues on her predecessors.
Stitt said in a statement Friday that Drummond should focus on prosecuting criminals rather than those he has “targeted as political enemies.”
“I’ve tasked Allie Friesen with the difficult job of shining a light on an agency that has operated in darkness for far too long,” he said. “Anytime bureaucracy is disturbed, those committed to the status quo will try and stop (the) truth from being revealed. The same thing is happening to President (Donald) Trump as he tries to clean up the bureaucracy in D.C. Commissioner Friesen is going to continue to do this work.” 
In a later statement, he said the issues emerging from the agency are the result of “years of mismanagement” and did not happen overnight. Stitt outlined a plan of action in a letter to legislative leaders, including bringing in a “highly respected, independent financial expert” from outside the agency to temporarily take control of the department’s finances, officially naming a special investigator, and directing the head of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, along with mental health agency officials, to conduct a “top-to-bottom review of all Medicaid and federally funded functions within the agency.”
Friesen did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Drummond’s call for her termination, but said in an earlier statement that agency leaders are working with Stitt’s office and state leaders to “navigate a difficult but necessary period of operational and fiscal reform” and ensure continuity of services and stability of the workforce. 
“This process, while challenging, is essential to strengthening financial systems, improving oversight, and ensuring operational integrity,” Friesen said. 
Payroll issues
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, said he received a call Thursday afternoon from the agency’s legislative liaison informing him officials don’t have enough money to make payroll next week.

Lawson, who chairs a special House committee investigating the agency’s finances, said Friday that payroll issues have just now surfaced as a result of “significant mismanagement” or “unique budget practices” within the department. 
“So tracing money, where it’s coming from and where it’s going, has been challenging and problematic for staff,” he said. “And as they’ve continued to do their work, they’re discovering more problems, and being unable to meet payroll is just the most recent one.” 
The payroll shortfall will likely affect how hundreds, if not thousands, of state employees feed their families, Lawson said. He said based on his understanding, the payroll issues only affect state employees and not provider contracts. 
Lawmakers previously pointed out that in the last year, the agency hired 20 employees with salaries of $100,000 or more. Another 12 had their salaries raised to that level and 13 were hired with salaries under six figures. The average employee at the mental health department earns just under $52,000. 
Lawson said his committee plans to meet Monday morning in light of the payroll shortfall to question mental health leaders. He said it is possible the Legislature could make an emergency appropriation, but to do so would require support of two-thirds of the House and Senate. A recommendation could come after Monday’s hearing and after Republicans and Democrats meet privately to assess interest and need. 
The special House committee Lawson chairs has now met three times to probe the agency’s disarray and has questioned the qualifications of its interim chief financial officer and why the financial issues exist. 
He said it’s unclear if the $6.2 supplemental appropriation the agency has requested will be enough to get them through the fiscal year, which ends June 30. 
“You know, we’ve got a lot of questions on if we appropriate this money,” he said. “Is it indeed the right amount? Does that indeed get us through the rest of the fiscal year?”
The House wants “good and accurate” information, which can take time, Lawson said, but he’s glad the department proactively reached out.

“The last thing I want is to make a bad situation worse and ask a department who has identified budget problems to make rash decisions or quick decisions that are not good decisions and give us more bad information,” Lawson said. “I do feel like there’s a lot going on at that department to make good decisions, but unfortunately, I think it’s going to take a lot of time.” 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert wrote that he’d had a previous meeting with agency leadership and was assured there would be no cash flow issues before the end of May, according to an email sent Thursday night to House lawmakers, which was obtained by Oklahoma Voice.
He wrote that Friesen first learned of the payroll shortage at 3 p.m. Thursday. 
“We are out of time and will not accept any more delays. Individuals at ODMHSAS have known about this shortfall for months yet it is the final month of (the) legislative session and we still do not have answers. This is unacceptable,” he said Friday in a statement. “We will get to the bottom of how this happened and who is responsible. The people of Oklahoma deserve better than this dysfunction. Our top priority remains maintaining vital services while also being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Kate Zanger has worked in higher education for 49 years, more than half of that time at Clarke University in Dubuque. The vice president for student life is set to retire at the end of the spring semester.
In her career working at universities in Washington, D.C., and New York, Zanger said she has never seen actions taken against international students like the mass changes to Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) statuses and visa revocations that swept across the U.S.
This is a “time of fear” for international students, said Zanger, the principal designated school official at Clarke working with the Student and Exchange Visitor program. While many students’ statuses have been restored at this point, officials working with impacted students say there will be social and economic consequences down the road.
“For U.S. citizens, this time is kind of frightening, because of everything that you hear that’s going on with the government,” Zanger said. “Imagine being an international student trying to figure this out.”
Iowa universities confirm more than a dozen impacted students
Of the 40 Iowa public universities, community colleges and private institutions contacted by the Iowa Capital Dispatch and the 28 that responded, 13 acknowledged having some number of university students or recent graduates with changed SEVIS statuses.
The only state university to provide specific numbers of international students was the University of Northern Iowa, reporting two students with terminated — and reinstated — SEVIS statuses. Representatives from the University of Iowa and Iowa State University both stated there were students at their institutions who have seen their status change, but declined to say how many students and how many have been reinstated.
At least four UI students have been impacted by student status revocations, and are suing the Department of Homeland Security for the actions taken against them. According to reporting by the Iowa State Daily, at least two ISU students have seen their visas revoked.
Other colleges confirming impacted international students include Coe College, Clarke University, Eastern Iowa Community Colleges, Mount Mercy University, Luther College, Graceland University, Des Moines Area Community College, Southeastern Community College and St. Ambrose University.
All respondents saw either one or two student statuses change, and all but two students across all of the institutions have seen their statuses restored.

Some students have also seen their visas revoked with much more aggressive language than in the past, said Karen Edwards, Grinnell College dean for International Student Affairs and principal designated school official.
Grinnell College refused to give specific numbers of impacted students, however, Edwards said around 20% of the student body, or around 340 students, are international, and some have seen both their SEVIS status change and their visa canceled.
While Edwards said F1 student visa revocation as a result of criminal activity is nothing new, and because these visa holders have “duration of status benefits,” they are not required to immediately leave the country if their visa is revoked, but they will have to reapply for a visa if they do travel abroad.
In the past when students were notified of their visa revocation, Edwards said information would be included explaining all of this. Now, language on these notices is “harsher,” she said, warning the holder that they are subject to detention or deportation to a country not their own.
Edwards said the termination of SEVIS records is incredibly troublesome, as it is the record giving international students lawful status to study and complete other requirements and enabling information access and sharing for universities when needed.
“When a SEVIS record is terminated, for example, someone who’s here can’t record their address update, or can’t reduce their course load in their final semester, or can’t submit other applications, a transfer to a new program or graduate level,” Edwards said. “So it really does immediately mean they can’t function as a lawful F1 student here.”
Even alumni who have continued to stay in the U.S. lawfully under their visa and SEVIS status have been impacted, Edwards said.
Uncertainty and fear for students
Moving away from campus. Trying to find legal representation. Missing a commencement ceremony and having to figure out how to retrieve an earned degree. These are some of the hardships endured by international students with terminated SEVIS statuses and revoked visas, according to university officials.
At St. Ambrose University in Davenport, two students saw a change in their SEVIS status and chose to leave the campus. Ricki Grover, international student advisor and study abroad coordinator, said in an email the university provided financial support to the students through its student emergency fund, helped them connect with legal resources and ensured they’d be able to complete their coursework over the summer.
While these statuses have now been reinstated, Grover said the students have not returned to campus.
Some universities have legal experts on hand to help impacted international students, Zanger said, but smaller colleges like Clarke don’t. She said she reached out to larger institutions to see if an attorney would be available to represent the one Clarke student who saw their status terminated, but no one had the time. It can be difficult to find an immigration lawyer who has the expertise to work with students, she said.
Students have told her they’re choosing to stay in the U.S. for the summer out of fear that they won’t be let back in to finish their studies, and Zanger said she’s recommended all international students carry with them the correct documents when traveling.
Others have said if they can’t reenter the country, then they don’t really want to be here anyway.
“We try to assure them that we want you here at Clarke, we want you to graduate from Clarke, you bring a lot to our campus community,” Zanger said.
The one student at Graceland University in Lamoni who saw their visa revoked was supposed to walk in the university’s commencement ceremony on April 27, but couldn’t, despite their visa being reinstated that weekend. Graceland spokesperson Shane Adams said in an email the university will work with the student to ensure they still receive their degree.
“We were disappointed that the student was not able to walk with their classmates on Sunday,” Adams said in his email.
National actions could cause drop in international enrollment
International student enrollment in U.S. universities has been increasing over the past few years, with the 2024 Open Doors Report citing an increase of more than 25,000 students between the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years.
The U.S. has traditionally been viewed as a welcoming and supportive space for students, which Edwards said has made the country a higher education destination for those wishing to study abroad. She worries about how actions taken against international students will impact what she called the country’s fifth-largest export — higher education.
“I think right now, given the climate in the U.S. … if I was coming from another country, I might think twice about studying in the U.S.,” Zanger said, “which is very sad, because our international students bring a lot to each of the campuses they are part of.”
According to data from nonprofit NAFSA: Association of International Educators, in the 2023-2024 academic year alone, international students supported more than 378,000 jobs and contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy. International students in Iowa have contributed nearly $272 million to the state economy and close to 1,900 jobs.
Beyond any economic impact these actions could have, Edwards said the diplomacy, goodwill and innovations that come with international students and the global perspectives and connections they bring will most likely be damaged.
“If we are less viewed as an education destination, that really places our whole way of thinking and learning at risk and it turns us into an isolationist space, as opposed to a global space with thinkers from all over the world,” Edwards said. “That’s what drew me to the field. That’s what makes me passionate about what I do and I see it at work here, because students from all over the world sit in the same classroom, (and) whether they’re talking about English literature or whether they’re doing a science project, it just brings a new voice to the table that helps everybody.”

The suit accuses the companies of receiving personal information through California’s state health insurance exchange.


One day after an investigation by CalMatters and The Markup, LinkedIn and Google were hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging they improperly received confidential data from trackers on California’s health insurance exchange website. 
A California congressman, citing the investigation, then called on the federal Health and Human Services Department to investigate the exchange’s sharing of data to LinkedIn.
In the article, published this week, CalMatters and The Markup revealed how trackers on the website, coveredca.com, sent information on visitors to LinkedIn through a tool called the Insight Tag. As visitors filled out forms on the site, the trackers sent LinkedIn information about them, including whether they were pregnant, blind, transgender, or had experienced domestic abuse. The trackers also monitored information on visitors’ searches for medical providers and how often those visitors used prescription drugs.

How the state sent Californians’ personal health data to LinkedIn 
April 28, 2025April 27, 2025 




The government entity that operates the exchange, Covered California, has since removed the trackers. A spokesperson said they had been used as part of an advertising campaign that began in February 2024.
The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California, cites forensic testing by CalMatters and The Markup, as well as research by the plaintiff, to allege that LinkedIn and Google received health data from web trackers on coveredca.com without the knowledge or consent of users. The plaintiff in the suit is an anonymous California woman who alleges she filled out information on Covered California around June of last year, and had that information sent to LinkedIn and Google.
A proposed class action, the lawsuit seeks to represent everyone who had information transmitted to the tech companies by Covered California. The firm representing her, Bursor and Fisher, has a speciality in class-action suits, including in data privacy, and touts receiving a $100 million settlement from Google for alleged privacy violations in 2022. 
“LinkedIn and Google intentionally intercepted sensitive and confidential communications between Covered California and its customers,” the suit, which seeks to represent others similarly situated, reads. “LinkedIn and Google failed to receive consent for these interceptions.”
“LinkedIn and Google failed to receive consent.”Proposed class action lawsuit filed in federal court over sharing of sensitive data from California’s health insurance exchange.
The suit alleges that the tracking runs afoul of California and federal laws, including the California Invasion of Privacy Act, which requires consent before “communications” can be sent to third parties. The companies made similar violations under the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, according to the suit.
Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A LinkedIn spokesperson referred to the company’s previous statement, saying that its policies “expressly prohibit customers from installing the Insight Tag on web pages that collect or contain sensitive data, including pages offering health-related services.” 
Millions of people in the state have received coverage through Covered California, set up under the Affordable Care Act as a way for Californians to quickly and easily shop for insurance and compare plans. In a statement posted online after publication of the  CalMatters and Markup story, the organization said it was “reviewing the nature and extent of sensitive consumer data and information that was inadvertently shared with LinkedIn.”
Since the tracking was revealed, the story has also drawn the attention of lawmakers. Rep. Kevin Kiley, who called the sharing of data “incredibly disturbing,” sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services asking it to investigate whether the tracking may have violated privacy laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Kiley is a Republican whose California district stretches from suburban Sacramento to Death Valley.
Among other questions, the letter asks the agency to determine how many people were affected by the tracking, and how “something like this [can] be prevented in the future.”

(Image courtesy of HOK Architecture)Construction is ramping up at a new state psychiatric hospital as Washington works to meet continued demand for treatment of people accused of crimes.
The state broke ground in October on the new 350-bed facility at Western State Hospital in Pierce County. Work began in December, but picked up last month and passersby will start to see the building develop in June, said state Department of Social and Health Services spokesperson Jessica Nelson. 
For years, the Department of Social and Health Services has been under court oversight to improve unconstitutionally long wait times for mental health treatment and evaluations for criminal defendants who are incompetent to stand trial. The new hospital is key to complying with a court-ordered settlement in the case known as Trueblood.
Washington is required to conduct an evaluation within 14 days and offer inpatient competency restoration treatment within seven days. The state has long struggled to meet those guidelines and has paid hundreds of millions in fines as a result.
At the groundbreaking for the new hospital in October, then-Gov. Jay Inslee noted the rise in need for these services over the past few years. 
“This exponential growth was not sustainable unless we really put pedal to the metal on our building programs with what we’re doing today,” Inslee said. “So we have invested tremendous resources to respond to this tremendous challenge.”
In February, the most recent month for which comprehensive state data is available, the average wait time for a jail-based evaluation was about 11 days. Inpatient evaluations took five to six days. Admissions for treatment took nearly seven days at Eastern State Hospital, near Spokane, and less than six days at Western State. In years past, this could take over a year. 
The new Western State Hospital will be the latest addition to the state’s bed capacity. 
In 2023, the state acquired and opened a psychiatric hospital in Tukwila for patients under civil commitments, freeing up space for criminal defendants at Western State. 
Last year, the state added another 86 beds at Eastern and Western State hospitals. 
In their capital budget passed last weekend, state lawmakers included $282 million for the final phase of construction at the new hospital. The budget now sits on Gov. Bob Ferguson’s desk. 
The hospital is aiming to help shift the focus at Western State more toward people entangled in the criminal justice system who need treatment and away from civil patients. Under that system, civil commitments would transfer to community-based facilities to get help.
Construction is expected to be completed between 2027 and 2029.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerSam Hartnett is a reporter with Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.A bill to help farms recoup losses due to extreme weather could bring forestry businesses into the mix as it makes its way across the Legislature.S.60 sets up a farm relief fund that lawmakers seem to agree should be accessible to loggers as well. Only farms would qualify for the money under the Senate’s initial plan, which came together after floods and freezes in recent years devastated Vermont agriculture.Over the last two years, “persistently rainy conditions made many forested areas too wet to harvest,” a rep from the Professional Logging Contractors of the Northeast told legislators last week in the House committee dealing with agriculture and forestry. Those conditions came alongside damage to roads and bridges due to flooding. Heavy mud seasons and warmer, wetter winters in particular can inhibit both the harvest and transport of timber, leaving loggers stuck.Lawmakers had already been looking at including foresters in the bill when the testimony came. Shortly after, a draft doing just that was introduced.“We expect the loggers impacted would be a fraction of the claims, but their losses from adverse  weather events cause great hardship, and giving loggers the opportunity to apply for emergency funds seems fair,” said Rep. Michelle Bos-Lun, D-Westminster, who had sponsored a nearly identical House bill that covered foresters.A typical forestry outfit’s business model looks a lot different from the average farm, but people in both industries are subject to extreme weather events hurting bottom lines. “Loggers have historically been left out of these relief bills,” said Rep. David Durfree, D-Shaftsbury. Flood relief efforts like the Business Emergency Gap Assistance Program didn’t extend funds to loggers as their losses were considered revenue loss, according to the logging organization.The inclusion of foresters raises questions about who or what would receive payments. Loggers often use sub-contractors for loading logs or trucking timber, and legislators need to determine if or how the fund could compensate those workers.“Clearly, there are different circumstances for a farmer than there are for a logging contractor, and the biggest one is that the logging contractor doesn’t generally own the property they are working on,” said Dana Doran, the rep from the logging group, told the House Committee on Agriculture, Food Resiliency and Forestry.In a phone call Monday, Doran was confident lawmakers would find a way to ensure everyone involved in a logging operation could be compensated.He believes the important part is setting up legislation to provide much needed relief for struggling foresters.As laid out earlier this year, the fund would help farms recover losses or reimburse them for unexpected costs. Those could include wages, wiped-out income from destroyed crops or repairs to roads. It would cover up to 50% of uninsured or uncovered losses, up to $150,000 per year for a farm. A review board would make the final call, with a turnaround coming at most 30 days from officials receiving an “administratively complete application,” under ideal circumstances.The updated version of the bill in the House committee in late April included two forestry operators on the review board alongside the previously planned group of state officials, farmers and farming orgs. Forest fires have also been added to the list of eligible extreme weather events.Legislators also added a limit on the proportion of the fund a single farm or forestry operation could receive at 5%. The maximum funding a single entity could receive from the program remains capped at $150,000. The bill is now being considered in the state Senate.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Proposed farmer relief fund for floods and more could now include loggers.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/logging-2-20230202.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(USFWS)The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks is asking anglers in the state to help with ongoing trout research projects.
Working with Montana State University, biologists are in their second year of tagging trout in the Big Hole, Beaverhead, Ruby and Madison rivers. The ongoing research project is aimed at understanding trout population declines in those waterways, and overall health concerns for fish in the Upper Missouri River Basin.
Anglers are asked to report any tagged fish that they catch, essentially working as “citizen scientists” to provide information on environmental conditions and other factors that contribute to the survival and mortality of trout.
“This is a great chance for anglers to take an active part in this research that will benefit the fishery,” said FWP Fisheries Manager Mike Duncan in a press release. “We need your help. Please report the tagged fish you catch.”
Each fish tag — colored blue or yellow — has a unique number and will be attached near the dorsal fin.

FWP says that anglers who catch a tagged fish should use clippers to remove the tag as close to the skin as possible while minimizing handling time and exposure to air for the fish, then submit a report for each tagged fish they catch from the four rivers mentioned above. These reports will include information such as the tag number, date, location, condition of the fish, gear type used, and whether the angler released or harvested the fish.
A how-to video on the process is available on FWP’s website.
FWP operates a rewards program as an incentive for anglers to take part and report tags. Reported blue tags will be entered into regular drawings for gear and fishing trips, while reports of yellow tags are each worth $100.
Some fish may still be carrying tags from last year, according to FWP, which may be covered in algae and less noticeable to anglers, but the same reporting process and reward opportunities apply to older tags.
Reports can be submitted by visiting mtcfru.org/msutag or by calling 406-994-2384.
Anglers and other river recreationists may also meet staff from MSU while on the river. These creel clerks will be interviewing recreational river users as part of the ongoing research effort.
The research project in 2024 after annual sampling the year before found fish numbers to be at or near historical lows in sections of the Upper Missouri River Basin. Since then, FWP has been working closely with MSU to study fish mortality, recruitment and health.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13982951691_6da005c3eb_o-1024x714.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

Proceeds from the event fund educational programs that offer a chance for a better life. 
Held every Sunday in October and one weekend in April, the infamous prison rodeo is one of the highlights of the year for the hundreds of men incarcerated at the Louisiana State Penitentiary who participate in the events. 
Despite its controversies, the rodeo’s most ardent supporters are its participants, for whom the event is a rare bridge to the world outside Angola’s thousands of acres and an opportunity to financially support themselves and their education. 
Andrew Hundley, executive director of the Louisiana Parole Project, which assists formerly incarcerated people as they reenter society, likened Angola to a college campus. It’s an apt metaphor for Hundley, who completed correspondence courses at LSU while he was incarcerated at Angola. 
“There are a lot of opportunities there to use your time wisely, or use your time not so wisely,” Hundley said. “For the people who want to use their time wisely, they’re more than a dozen vocational programs that are there, from automotive repair to collision repair, carpentry, welding, plumbing, small engine repair, you name it.”

‘Wildest Show in the South’
The rodeo is unlike any professional rodeo. For starters, the 75 or so men who compete don’t receive any training. For many of them, the first time they mount a bull is just seconds before the gates open. 
While the men do receive safety vests and helmets, the lack of training makes it more dangerous than a traditional rodeo. After one event at the April 26 rodeo, one incarcerated person was seen falling multiple times trying to get out of the arena after his event, eventually having to be helped out of the mud. 
This rodeo — nicknamed “the Wildest Show in the South” — is also different because it offers unique events that add to the spectacle — like bull pinball. 
It works like this: a rodeo clown sets down hula hoops in the arena, and an incarcerated person stands in each one. A bull is released and the last man remaining in his hoop wins. 
A clown identified only as Rudy exchanged banter with the rodeo emcee over the arena’s public address system.
“Now what would make a human being get in one of them hoops?” Rudy asked during the show.  
“It’s kind of like trying to sign up for the Darwin Award,” the emcee replied, referencing the rhetorical honor given to people who contribute to evolution by removing themselves from the gene pool, usually through a foolish and dangerous act. 
The prison has held its rodeo since 1965 and has been the subject of frequent criticism. 
Operating as a farm on the site of a former slave plantation, Louisiana State Penitentiary has a brutal history. For much of its time, it has been known for indiscriminate violence. Even after significant reforms throughout the late 20th century, it is still the subject of controversy. 
Workers on the prison’s “farm line,” who pick the vegetables that help feed the prisoners, are currently suing the state, alleging dangerous working conditions. Inmates at Angola can earn a maximum of $8 a week, regardless of the type of work they do. 
Despite the danger and outside criticism, none of the dozen incarcerated men or formerly incarcerated men the Illuminator interviewed at the rodeo had a negative thing to say about the event. 
Assistant Warden Anne Easley sat in on all interviews the lluminator conducted at the rodeo. Only incarcerated people with trusty status, meaning they have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have good disciplinary records, were participating in the event and therefore available for interviews. 
In addition to rodeo participants, interviewees included inmate-instructors and incarcerated people selling crafts they made using skills learned at the prison. The craft fair, held outside the rodeo arena, has an atmosphere not unlike a flea market. It offers handmade goods including furniture, art and jewelry. Merchandise sales support the incarcerated people financially or finance prison organizations such as sobriety groups. 
“Y’all come to this rodeo to find out how people feel about it. If all of your views on a rodeo are negative, and you’re not getting all negative answers, then something’s off, right?,” Jeffrey Hilburn, editor of The Angolite, the prison’s news magazine, said in an interview. “But if you come here and you find out that an inmate who’s making a hobby craft … he’s going to get a good percentage of that money.” 
“His family doesn’t have to send him that money. His family can pay their taxes, gas bill, save enough and buy a dozen eggs for $10,” added Hilburn, who serving time for the 1991 second-degree murder of Mark Jones in Richland Parish. He was recently denied parole. 
But support for the rodeo, while widespread among incarcerated people and formerly incarcerated people, is not universal. 
Norris Henderson, now executive director of Voice of the Experienced, an organization that advocates for incarcerated people, was once held at Angola. Henderson was exonerated after 27 years of incarceration. As a volunteer in the prison infirmary, he saw first-hand the injuries of the rodeo participants. 
“To me, the rodeo was just this form of exploitation,” Henderson said. “This is kind of like the Roman Coliseum, where people come to cheer, not the humans in the arena, they come to cheer the animals? 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
‘This whole place has made me a different person’
The career training programs the rodeo finances are run by inmate-instructors, who are required to have the same certifications as those who teach the same courses at a community or technical college. 
There are 17 different career and technical education programs at the prison. According to a fact-sheet included in a souvenir rodeo program, the inmate-led reentry training and mentoring program saves the state $4 million a year. 
Among the instructors is Luther McFarland, the only incarcerated person with teaching certification from the American Welding Society. He is also certified by the National Center for Construction Education and Research.

Like most other instructors at Angola, McFarland is a “lifer,” meaning he’s serving a life sentence. McFarland, who does not have the possibility of parole, was convicted of the 2004 second-degree murder of Coulton Lyell Jr. in Metairie. 
McFarland has a welding certification from Baton Rouge Community College, which he received before the school ended its program at Angola due to budget constraints. McFarland said he has taught welding at Angola since 2010. 
“It really helped me build character … when you’re coming from the streets and you got guys from New Orleans … coming with some mindset,  it was really a challenge, but we got through it,” McFarland said of his time as an instructor. “It wasn’t easy, but we got through it.”  
The instruction has to start with basics, as many of his students have never handled basic tools. But eventually they get trained up enough to do serious work, McFarland said. Several of the barbeque grills he and his students had welded were on sale that Saturday. 
“We learn how to just get the guys up to a par so when they go home, they have the mindset to be able to work in this type of environment and know what to expect from them because it’s the same way,” McFarland said. 
McFarland said his work training his students to be welders when they’re released was the start of his legacy. Though not eligible for parole, he hopes he will receive clemency. In order to receive a sentence commutation, an individual must receive a favorable vote of the Pardon Board as well as approval from the governor. 
Two of McFarland’s former students came to visit their former instructor at the rodeo, including Austin McCraine, father to a newborn. McCraine served time for theft. He said he came back to the rodeo to pay homage to his friends and mentors. 
McCraine worked in welding for a year before moving up to a pipefitter’s job, which typically calls for more skills and experience – and pays better.
“I’ve been working there for almost a year now,” McCraine said. “This whole place has made me a different person.”

Students at the University of South […[...]","The Horseshoe of the University of South Carolina campus, Monday, Oct. 30, 2023 in Columbia, S.C.(File/Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The federal government has restored the visa status of more than a dozen international students at South Carolina colleges. Still, a lawsuit filed by a University of South Carolina international student from Nigeria, arguing he was denied due process, continues amid ongoing changes to U.S. immigration policy.
Students at the University of South Carolina, Furman University and Clemson University were among more than 1,800 international students across the country who had lost their legal status changed with little to no explanation from the federal government in recent weeks.
After a flurry of legal challenges in federal courts nationwide, the government began reversing those terminations late last week and said it would issue new guidelines for canceling a student’s legal status.
Among those who saw their status reinstated, at least for now, was Matthew Ariwoola, 32, of Nigeria.
“Matthew’s status was revoked with no notice and no explanation. Just as suddenly, with just as little explanation his status was restored,” said ACLU of South Carolina spokesman Paul Bowers, whose organization is representing Ariwoola in court. “The reason we’re still fighting this is to defend his due process rights.”
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security previously referred the SC Daily Gazette to the U.S. Department of State. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ariwoola, a fourth-year doctoral chemistry student at USC, was scheduled to graduate in December.
But on April 8, USC staff informed Ariwoola and at least 11 other students they could not continue studying or teaching due to the change of their immigration status in a Homeland Security-maintained database.
USC staff then recommended in an email to Ariwoola included in court filings that he “depart the United States as soon as possible because you no longer have legal status in the United States.”
U.S. District Judge Jacquelyn Austin stepped in, granting and then extending a temporary order through May 16, to prevent Ariwoola’s detention or deportation while the case makes its way through the court system.
USC and Furman have since confirmed the status changes of impacted students — two at Furman and a dozen at USC — were reversed. Clemson did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette about the status of impacted students at the Upstate university.
Just days after the reversals, the federal government revealed its expanded policy on reasons international students’ legal status can be terminated. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement document, filed this week in a federal court in Texas, said reasons for termination now include the revocation of the visas granted to students to enter the U.S.
Historically, students whose visas were revoked or expired have not lost their legal residency status and could stay in the U.S. to finish school. It only prevented their leaving the U.S. and returning without reapplying.
Ariwoola’s student visa expired in February.
Remarks made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in March suggested the new administration’s stance would differ from past standards.
“Your visa is expired, your visa is revoked, you have to leave,” he told reporters. “There is no right to a student visa.””
Under the new guidance that has come in in court proceedings, Homeland Security officials also seem to have stripped students of their status simply if their names appeared in a criminal or fingerprint database, The Associated Press reported.
In the case of Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems at the University of Texas in Arlington, Department of Homeland Security officials told the judge employees ran the names of student visa holders through an FBI database that lists missing persons, the names of suspects and arrests, even if charges were dropped or never filed.
In total, about 6,400 students were identified.
Police arrested Ariwoola in 2023 on a warrant out of Georgia for alleged “theft by deception,” a crime which can involve the use of in-person or cyber scams to steal from a victim. But according to the ACLU, Ariwoola had never contacted the accuser, and the prosecutor had dismissed all charges.
Even so, Ariwoola has no way of knowing for certain if that’s why the government changed his status. The attorneys have yet to fully respond to Ariwoola’s allegations.
Because Ariwoola’s status was restored, government lawyers wrote in court filings that they intend to ask the judge to dismiss the lawsuit if the student does not withdraw it before June 20.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SC26-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Religious leaders in Washington will be required to report child abuse or neglect, even when it is disclosed in confession, under a new law signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson on Friday.
“Protecting our kids, first, is the most important thing. This bill protects Washingtonians from abuse and harm,” Ferguson said, noting Washington is one of five states in which clergy are not currently mandated reporters.
It took Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, three years to get the bill to the governor’s desk. Making sure disclosures during confidential conversations between a penitent and religious leader were not exempt was critical, she said.
“You never put somebody’s conscience above the protection of a child,” she said.
Senate Bill 5375 passed by margins of 64-31 in the House and 28-20 in the Senate. It takes effect July 27. 
It adds clergy members to the state’s list of individuals legally required to report suspected child abuse to law enforcement or the Department of Children, Youth and Families.
Clergy would join school personnel, nurses, social service counselors, psychologists, and many others with a duty to report when they have “reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.”
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
While disclosures in confession or other religious rites where the clergy member is bound to confidentiality are not exempt, religious leaders will retain their privilege to not be compelled to testify in related court cases or criminal proceedings.
More than half the states make clergy mandatory reporters and most exempt what is heard in a confessional. Washington will join several states, including New Hampshire and West Virginia where such conversations are not exempt.
“It says the church is not above the law, especially when it comes to protecting children,” said Mary Dispenza, a founding member of the Catholic Accountability Project and member of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. “We know children will be safer as a result of passing this law.”
Removing the confessional privilege proved the most divisive provision in legislative debates. 
It’s the chief reason the Washington State Catholic Conference opposed the legislation. They said it would force priests to break the seal of confession, considered a sacred promise to never reveal any of the information disclosed.
Most Republican lawmakers were opposed to including the confessional, too. They argued in hearings and floor debates that abusers would do more harm because they would no longer be able to freely confide and seek forgiveness.
Keeping the confessional in the bill did not give Ferguson pause.
“Not for me,” he said. As a Catholic, “I’m very familiar with it. Been to confession, myself. I felt this was important legislation for protecting kids.”
Frame has said her push for the legislation began after reading an InvestigateWest account of a lawsuit alleging a Jehovah’s Witnesses congregation in Spokane covered up abuse of children by an elder.
Momentum grew as Catholic and Jehovah’s Witness survivors shared their stories with lawmakers and argued for including the confessions, she said. 
“This is going to protect children in other religious communities, especially Jehovah’s Witnesses,” said Marino Hardin of Seattle, who worked to pass the law on behalf of abuse victims. “I believe that a lot more children will not fall through the cracks.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ferguson-clergy-bill-signing-may-2-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

Erik Smith, Gov. Laura Kelly and Kansas Bureau of Investigation Director Tony Mattivi, standing left to right. Sarah Meeks, left in red, was wife of the late Derby Police Department Detective Charles Meeks, who died in a traffic accident in 1976. His name was added this year to the state monument. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Sarah Meeks said she was the one expected to perish in the head-on collision during a late-evening rainstorm on US-54 in southwest Kansas.
When an elderly motorist drifted across the yellow line at 9 p.m. May 5, 1976, about 2 miles east of Bucklin, Sarah Meeks woke up just in time to see blur of the oncoming car’s rapidly approaching headlights. Force of the impact threw her into the windshield and caused extensive head trauma. Her husband, Derby Police Department Detective Charles Meeks, initially was treated for a broken arm and shattered leg. But, tragically, Charles Meeks passed away four days later. His wife survived.
“I was the one who was supposed to be dead,” Sarah Meeks said. “When they did the autopsy, they found it was a brain bleed that did him in.”
Sarah Meeks recounted those harrowing moments Friday after the annual service in Topeka honoring men and women who had their names carved into the Kansas Law Enforcement Memorial on the Capitol grounds.
The 307th and 308th names etched into the circular memorial were that of Meeks, who died at age 34 while driving to a firearms competition as a representative of the police department, and Leavenworth County Deputy Sheriff Glenn Curtiss, who was shot and killed at age 26 during a scuffle with the suspect in an Oct. 29, 1924, bank robbery in Linwood.
Gov. Laura Kelly and Tony Mattivi, director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, spoke of the state’s good fortune that no names would be added to pay tribute to law enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice during 2024.
“Today, we’re fortunate that for the first time in several years we’re not mourning new line-of-duty deaths in Kansas. That is a blessing,” she said. “But it does not change the solemn responsibility we have to remember those that did give their lives. To all families of fallen officers, you carry a burden few can understand.”
Kelly said the service acknowledged courage demonstrated by law enforcement officers who responded to crimes, of course, but also intervened when people were stricken by mental illness, addiction, homelessness and other challenges evident in society.
The death of Meeks and Curtiss were memorialized in speech, prayer and song. A pipe and drum corps’ offered a rendition of “Amazing Grace.” A line of officers delivered the traditional 21-volley salute. More than 100 uniformed law enforcement officers from Kansas stood at attention on the memorial’s perimeter.
Mattivi, representing the KBI, said Kansans had a duty to recognize women and men who lost their lives while engaged in work to protect communities.
“We mourn the officers whose lives were cut short. We remember their sacrifices in the name of justice.” Mattivi said. “We promise to stand together as brothers and sisters in blue and do everything possible to avoid other senseless tragedies. To each of you, who stand in the same line of fire and risk your lives every single day, thank you.”
Sarah Meeks and her son, Charles, who was 9 years old when the detective died, joined other families in placing flowers on the memorial wall where names of the deceased reside. Both wife and son appreciated the opportunity, after nearly half a century, to take part in the commemoration of lives lost.
“We’ve been to Washington, D.C., and seen the name on the monument there,” Sarah Meeks said. “This is great. He always wanted to be in law enforcement.”

(Photo by Michele Jokinen/Minnesota House of Representatives Information Services)Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill creating new safety standards for workers who use scuba equipment to remove underwater weeds from lakes, following the deaths of two young and inexperienced divers.
Brady Aune and Joe Anderson died two years apart in remarkably similar accidents that their parents blame on the carelessness of their employers. They allege the companies didn’t provide adequate training or safety equipment that might have saved their lives.
Neither man was certified in scuba diving. In fact, neither had been scuba diving before they were handed oxygen tanks and weighted belts and sent to pull out weeds in deep murky water with little to no supervision.
“Brady and Joseph were two remarkable young men whose tragic, preventable deaths are a stark reminder that workplace safety cannot be an afterthought,” Walz said in a statement announcing his signature on May 1, International Workers Day.
The law, which had Democratic and Republican authors, requires workers who use scuba equipment to have an open water scuba diver certificate, or more advanced certificate, from a nationally recognized agency.
Commercial diving operations must also ensure a standby diver is available when another worker is in the water, and that workers are trained in first aid and CPR.
Companies must require workers to wear a buoyancy control device that can inflate automatically like the yellow emergency vests on airplanes, as well as an illuminated dive beacon and other safety equipment.
The law took effect immediately.
Aune was 20 years old when he drowned in Lake Minnetonka in Spring 2022 on his fourth day working for $16 an hour for Dive Guys, an aquatic weed removal company owned by Matt Wilkie.
Investigators found Aune’s weighted belt was on backward, so he wasn’t able to remove it, and that just one of the five employees on the job was trained in scuba diving.
Anderson was 18 years old when he drowned in Lac Lavon in Dakota County in 2024 while working for a different company, Your Lake Aquatic Plant Management. It was his third day on the job and his first time diving underwater.
His parents say he was a strong swimmer, but he received just 15 minutes of training the day he died, from a co-worker who wasn’t scuba certified. Anderson’s supervisor also wasn’t trained in CPR, and while first responders were able to resuscitate him, he died three days later in the hospital.
OSHA fined Dive Guys $128,450 and Your Lake Aquatic Plant Management $730,000, which the company is appealing.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031125-PHOTO-workforce-MJ-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Teachers would be able to count years of experience in another field toward their paycheck under a bill the House passed this week.
The bill went back to the Senate, where it is likely to pass, sending it to the governor’s desk for his signature. Both the House and Senate passed the bill unanimously.
If the bill becomes law, certified teachers would be able to count every two years of work experience as one year of teaching in a similar subject matter. While that won’t fix the ongoing shortage of school staff on its own, it could make a difference when combined with other changes, supporters said.
SC Senate advances bill on teacher contracts called a ‘huge win’ for K-12 educators

“Quality teachers, to bring them in, we need tools in the toolbox,” said House Education Chairwoman Shannon Erickson, R-Beaufort. “And this is a tool in the toolbox.”
Prior work experience would not count toward a teacher’s other benefits or retirement.
Pay is often a leading deterrent for people looking to become a teacher after years in a different field. Because teachers in the state are paid based on their years of experience and highest college degree, a career-changer would start at a district’s lowest pay level for their educational experience.
That can come as a shock for someone who has spent years working in a private industry. Even people who have considered teaching might decide not to pursue it or leave after a few years because they can’t afford it or don’t want to take the pay cut, teachers’ advocates said.
At the same time, having teachers with lived experience in a field, including the expertise that comes with that, can be valuable for students, said Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association. For instance, a fellow teacher at Blythewood High School worked for Westinghouse Electric Company before bringing that knowledge to a chemistry classroom.
“All around, this policy is an easy win for teacher recruitment and retention,” Kelly said.
A new teacher with five years of other work experience and a bachelor’s degree could expect to see a starting salary about $2,000 higher than before the bill passed, according to a financial analysis of the bill.
Teachers who have been in the profession for years but started out on a different career path will also be able to request a bump in the state salary schedule from the Department of Education.
SC House budget plan raises teacher pay by $1,500 instead of $3,000

The department estimates that at least 9,400 teachers would be eligible for the credit, according to the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association remained skeptical about how many people would change their minds about teaching because of the bill. Even if it attracts a few teachers, though, that would be worth it, she said.
The key will be making sure those new teachers have the training to succeed in the classroom as well as in the private sector, she said. All teachers who receive the higher pay must also receive a teaching certificate before going into a classroom.
“If it will entice people into the classroom, we’re all for it,” East said. “However, we need to make sure career-changers have the support they need to be an effective teacher.”
Both the House and Senate passed a version of the bill last year, but it failed to reach the finish line after the House tacked on a separate education bill that the Senate then removed.
The bill House members attached, known as the Educator Assistance Act, headed to the governor’s desk this week after passing both chambers. Advocates expect that bill, which aims to cut down on red tape teachers face, to also bolster recruitment and retention.
As would a proposed increase to the state’s minimum pay for teachers, bringing it to $48,500 for first-year educators, advocates have said. That pay bump, included in both the House and Senate spending plans, is locked into the state budget.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ChildcareGetty-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)An environmental organization and a Native American advocacy group say two important Black Hills cultural and historical sites face threats from exploratory drilling projects.
One of the projects is proposed by Rapid City-based Pete Lien and Sons. It wants to conduct exploratory drilling for graphite on national forest land near Pe’ Sla, also known as Reynolds Prairie, which is a high-elevation meadow in the central Black Hills. Graphite is used in electric vehicle batteries, lubricants, pencils and other products.
Pe’ Sla is a ceremonial site for Lakota people, and it figures prominently in traditional Lakota creation stories.
“Drilling at Pe’ Sla would be like drilling under the Vatican or at a sacred site in Jerusalem,” said Taylor Gunhammer, an Oglala Lakota, in a news release. “Under any circumstances, it is not a place to be considering mining.”
Dakota Gold will conduct pre-permit study for potential mine in Homestake area

In response to questions from South Dakota Searchlight, a representative of Pete Lien and Sons said the U.S. Forest Service is reviewing the plan’s potential impact on sites of cultural and historical significance in the proposed project area, and questions and concerns should be directed to that agency. 
Gunhammer is a local organizer with NDN Collective, a Native American advocacy group in Rapid City. NDN and the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance are encouraging people to submit comments on the Pete Lien and Sons project and another project that could affect Craven Canyon in the southern Black Hills.
That’s where a Canadian company, Clean Nuclear Energy Corp., plans to conduct exploratory drilling for uranium on state-owned land located seven miles north of Edgemont. Uranium is the primary ingredient in nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants.
The Black Hills Clean Water Alliance and NDN said Craven Canyon contains 7,000-year-old cultural and historical sites of importance to Indigenous tribes, historians and archeologists.
A representative of Clean Nuclear Energy Corp., Mike Blady, said in email correspondence with South Dakota Searchlight that the proposed exploration area has been explored and mined previously. A letter to the company from state regulators last year said the area is within a quarter-mile of the edge of Craven Canyon, but Blady said the area is over a mile away.
“We are aware of the cultural significance and are doing everything in our power to ensure that there is no collateral damage,” Blady wrote. “We have consulted with the state and federal government as well as hosting an open house for Indigenous groups and are confident that there will not be adverse effects.
Meanwhile, another company, enCore Energy, hopes to mine uranium in the Edgemont area. Its various state and federal mining permit applications have been bogged down in administrative and court appeals for years.
The Clean Nuclear Energy Corp. drilling proposal will be considered by the state Board of Minerals and Environment. The Pete Lien and Sons proposal is under consideration by the supervisor of the Black Hills National Forest. Both proposals are open for public comment.

Vaillancourt, 53, of Rutland is brought in to Rutland criminal court for her arraignment after being charged with manslaughter and cruelty to a child arising from the January death of 6-month-old Harper Rose Briar at the defendant’s state-certified in-home day care facility. Pool photo by Robert Layman/Rutland HeraldThe Vermont Supreme Court has upheld the convictions of a former Rutland child care provider found guilty on charges of involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to a child in the death of a 6-month-old baby more than six years ago. Stacey Vaillancourt, 59, was charged in 2019 with giving a fatal amount of a sedative found in over-the-counter antihistamines to Harper Rose Briar, who was in her care. Vaillancourt was convicted of the two charges against her by a Rutland County jury following a trial in December 2023, and was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. She appealed her convictions, and Friday the five-member Vermont Supreme Court in a unanimous decision affirmed the jury’s guilty verdicts. “Defendant has not identified any grounds to disturb the jury’s verdict,” Justice Nancy Waples wrote in the 17-page ruling.“First, there was sufficient evidence presented for the jury to convict defendant for both involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to a child with death resulting,” Waples wrote. “Second, the verdicts against her are not inconsistent and do not violate double-jeopardy.”Rutland County State’s Attorney Ian Sullivan prosecuted the case at trial along with Deputy State’s Attorney Daron Raleigh. Deputy State’s Attorney Evan Meenan argued the appeal for the prosecution before the Vermont Supreme Court in March.“I hope today’s decision brings closure and a sense of justice to everyone who loved Harper during her all-too-brief life,” Sullivan said in a statement Friday.Dawn Matthews, an appellate attorney with the Vermont Defender General’s Office, argued Vaillancourt’s appeal. Matthews could not immediately be reached Friday for comment.The Pittsford infant died Jan. 24, 2019, at the child care facility that Vaillancourt ran out of her home on North Street in Rutland, according to charging documents filed in the case. Authorities had been called to Vaillancourt’s child care facility that day for a report that the infant was not breathing, the filings stated. Harper was taken by ambulance to Rutland Regional Medical Center, where she later died.It was Harper’s third day at the child care facility when, the charging documents stated, Vaillancourt gave her a fatal amount of diphenhydramine, an “over-the-counter (sedating) antihistamine used for treatment of allergic reactions.”An autopsy report from the chief medical examiner’s office showed that Harper’s death was a homicide caused by “diphenhydramine intoxication.”Vaillancourt’s defense had contended the state case was based on circumstantial evidence and also raised the possibility that another person could have administered the medication. Among the arguments in her appeal, Vaillancourt’s attorney stated that Judge Cortland Corsones erred at the trial by allowing into evidence two short videos of Harper because they were “unduly” prejudicial.“Here,” Waples wrote in the high court’s ruling, “the State argued that it had to prove causation, so videos showing (Harper’s) developmental capacity were relevant because they demonstrated that she did not have the capacity to either give herself medicine or protect herself from harm.”The high court rejected Vaillancourt’s argument regarding the videos.“Any emotional response generated in the jurors from the videos does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the videos,” Waples wrote in the decision.As of Friday, Vaillancourt was incarcerated at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility, the state’s only women’s prison, in South Burlington, according to the state Department of Corrections.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Supreme Court upholds convictions for Rutland child care provider in baby’s death.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190319_rhd_infant_death-daycare_Vaillancourt-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

The board alleges Amber Herzmann, 44, was working as a travel nurse from June 2024 through September 2024. On Sept. 10, 2024, the board alleges, her employment contract was suspended due to suspicion of medication misappropriation.
The board alleges a review of her charts suggests she was administering the narcotic painkiller fentanyl to women after they gave birth, although the drug is typically prescribed to patients during active labor. Multiple patients denied receiving the medication or the number of doses of medication Herzmann claimed to have administered, according to the board.

Herzmann’s employer later submitted a report to the Drug Enforcement Administration indicating 14 vials of fentanyl and two syringes of hydromorphone were lost or were suspected of being stolen.
The board charged Herzmann with misappropriation of patient medications. In resolving the case, the board agreed on April 10 to let Herzmann retain her license as a registered nurse, and Herzmann agreed to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, a program that offers assistance to health care professionals with substance abuse issues.
Court records show that on April 24, two weeks after the board approved that settlement agreement, Herzmann was criminally charged with nine felony counts of unlawfully obtaining a prescription drug, plus one aggravated misdemeanor charge of tampering with records.
Prosecutors allege that in October, November and December of 2024 — after her travel-nurse employment contract was suspended — Herzmann was working on the maternity floor of Mercy Hospital in Clinton where she claimed to have administered the narcotic painkillers fentanyl, oxycodone and Dilaudid to multiple patients but instead kept the drugs for her own purposes.
Herzmann is scheduled to be arraigned on May 22, 2025. She has yet to enter a plea in the case.
Other nursing board actions
Other nurses recently sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Nursing include:
— Stephanie Erdman, an advanced registered nurse practitioner who was charged with failing to assess and report the status of a patient, and failure to establish a relationship with a patient. The board alleges that at some unspecified time in the past, Erdman was working as the medical director of a medical spa where she prescribed drugs to a patient she didn’t see and then failed to follow up with the patient. The board settled the case by requiring Erdman to complete 30 hours of educational training on clinical supervision and documentation.
— Jean Havugimana, a licensed practical nurse who was recently charged by the board with leaving a nursing assignment without first ensuring the safety of his patients, and with committing an act or omission that might adversely affect a patient.
According to the board, Havugimana was working a 12-hour overnight shift at The Views of Marion, which operates the Oakview Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, on Jan. 27, 2024. On that night, Havugimana was the only nurse on duty to assist two certified nursing assistants in caring for roughly 40 residents. The facility’s video surveillance allegedly shows Havugimana was inside the facility for less than three hours during his 12-hour shift, and that he repeatedly exited and reentered the building.
The board alleges that during the night, the two CNAs were unable to reach Havugimana to assist with residents’ needs; that Havugimana had the keys necessary to access residents’ medications; and that he was the only person on duty authorized to administer medications.
At one point during the night, Havugimana was “observed in his vehicle, parked in the lot, playing loud music with a female passenger,” the board alleges. At a board hearing on the matter, Havugimana claimed he was working his shift as required, but was busy caring for patients in other areas of the building. According to the board, he offered no explanation as to why his colleagues couldn’t locate him or reach him via their cellphones and walkie-talkies.
In resolving the case, the board suspended Havugimana’s license for one year and stipulated that after the license is reinstated, it will be placed on probationary status for one year. As part of that probation, Havugimana will have to complete additional educational training and submit to chemical screening.
In 2009, the board charged Havugimana with falsely claiming to have completed his educational requirements for licensing and for failing to inform the board of a conviction for driving while barred as a habitual offender. The board suspended Havugimana’s license as a result of those charges.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama judge Thursday blocked the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) from regulating freestanding birth centers as hospitals, delivering a victory to midwives in the state.
Montgomery Circuit Court Judge Greg Griffin’s ruling concluded that the Alabama Legislature did not authorize the ADPH to regulate midwifery care in birth centers as “hospitals,” saying that ADPH’s attempt to impose hospital regulations on Freestanding Birth Centers (FSBCs), which offer an out-of-hospital birth option, was unlawful.
“Because both legal rules of statutory construction and undisputed record evidence make clear that FSBCs do not provide ‘obstetrical care,’ and do not provide care ‘to the public generally,’ ADPH’s attempt to regulate them as ‘hospitals’ exceeds its statutory authority and violates the AAPA,” Griffin wrote in the ruling.

Messages seeking comment was left with ADPH and the Alabama Attorney General’s office.
Birth centers are health care facilities dedicated to childbirth and are centered around the midwifery model of care. They are often looked at as an in-between option for mothers not completely comfortable with home births or the medical setting of a hospital. Supporters also say that it provides another option for people with low-risk pregnancies in a state where about 34% of counties are considered maternity care deserts.
Dr. Heather Skanes, OB-GYN and owner of Oasis Family Birth Center in Birmingham, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in an interview Friday that the ruling allows her to keep operating without “the burdensome regulations that ADPH was planning to impose” on them. Since reopening after the preliminary injunction, Skanes said that her birth center has been “able to start caring for birthing people again.”
“We’ve been doing births without any issues, and we’ve continued to provide safe and effective prenatal, labor, delivery, postpartum care in an underserved area here in Birmingham,” Skanes said.
New rules approved by the ADPH in 2023 required Alabama birth centers to be overseen by a physician; be located within 30 minutes of an OB-GYN hospital and seek hospital licenses. Birth center advocates feared these regulations, especially the hospital licensing requirement, would make it challenging to serve low-risk pregnancies, particularly in rural areas of the state with poor maternal health outcomes that may lack health care providers..
The plaintiffs, including the birth centers, midwives, and the Alabama affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives, filed a lawsuit in August 2023. The plaintiffs argued that these rules would make it nearly impossible for them to provide midwifery care. The following month, Griffin blocked ADPH from enforcing hospital licensing requirements on birth centers.
In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represents the plaintiffs, said the rule would ensure access to equitable pregnancy care in Alabama, a state facing a maternal and infant health crisis. This crisis disproportionately affects Black women, low-income communities, and those living in rural areas with limited access to hospitals.
“We are elated that the dedicated midwives at Alabama’s birth centers can continue to provide crucial care to pregnant Alabamians across the state without undue interference,” said Whitney White, staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. “Midwifery care in birth centers is safe, can improve patient outcomes, and can play a critical role in expanding access to equitable pregnancy care in Alabama.”
JaTaune Bosby Gilchrist, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, said the ruling affirms the essentiality of midwife-led care.
“This ruling is a powerful affirmation of what birth workers, families, and communities across Alabama have long known: midwife-led care is essential,” Gilchrist said in a statement. “As hospitals and obstetric services close across the state, particularly in rural areas, birth centers and midwives are stepping in to fill a dangerous gap in access.”
Skanes said that she hopes the ruling “allows Alabama to really reconsider the way that we provide maternal care.” She said that birthing centers could be a solution to providing maternal care by placing them “in strategic areas around the state.” She said that Alabamians would benefit from an integrative approach to maternal care that utilizes both birth centers and hospitals.
 “I think that we really have to change our mindset as physicians and as Alabamians, that this care can really be integrated into the medical system,” Skanes said. “That it doesn’t have to be something that’s stigmatized, it doesn’t have to be something that is talked down upon, but it’s just another option for women and for birthing people, and it works in conjunction with the hospital.”

DemasThis coverage is made possible through a partnership between IPR and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released a new, shorter timeline for its environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project.
In April, the Army Corps announced it would speed up its review of the tunnel project under a national energy emergency declared by President Donald Trump.
Friday’s announcement was the first time they gave specifics about Line 5 under the new emergency procedures.
The Army Corps will release the draft environmental review on May 30.
That starts the clock on public comment, with half as much time to give it under the new timeline — 30 days instead of 60.
Canada-based Enbridge has long sought to build a tunnel underneath the Straits of Mackinac to house a section of the Line 5 pipeline, which carries oil and natural gas liquids over 645 miles from Wisconsin to Ontario.
About four miles of the pipeline sits along the lakebed between Michigan’s two peninsulas. In 2020, Enbridge applied for a federal permit to build a tunnel for the pipeline and has said doing so would make it safer.
Opponents argue that the tunnel would further endanger the environment, the Great Lakes, and Indigenous ways of life. They also say Trump’s executive order undermines public input into such projects.
With the faster review process, the Army Corps could decide on a permit this fall — months earlier than previously planned.
The Army Corps permit process is one of the last major hurdles in this years’ long process for Enbridge — but not the final step. The company is redoing a permit for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.
“Our record of decision is estimated to be fall 2025,” said Army Corps spokesperson Carrie Fox in an email. “However, the Corps of Engineers permit cannot be issued before the EGLE permit is granted.”

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Aurelia Giacometto, the embattled secretary of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, has left the agency, according to a news release Friday from Gov. Jeff Landry.
The governor said Giacometto has accepted a position with Earth and Water Law, a firm in Washington, D.C. The governor has appointed Courtney Burdette to fill the vacancy left by Giacometto. 
Giacometto’s departure follows a year of tumult that began with high-ranking LDEQ executives resigning and publicly airing their complaints about her alleged harassment of subordinates. It was also brought to light that Giacometto used public money to travel to out-of-state political events with no obvious connection to her position in state government. 
The most recent high-end LDEQ resignation occurred Monday when its top financial executive left for another state agency, marking at least the 15th departure of a key employee under Giacometto’s tenure. Many of her highest-ranking lieutenants, several of whom were experienced civil servants, left after just a few months or weeks on the job. 
An Indiana native, Giacometto rose to political prominence as President Donald Trump’s appointee to head the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during his first term. After leaving her federal government post, she went on a speaking tour for the National Rifle Association, which she continued several months into her new job at LDEQ. She could not be reached for comment Friday.
Giacometto’s leadership style came under heightened scrutiny in March when Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack published the results of a workplace culture survey. Its results revealed pervasive low morale under her leadership, with some employees saying they felt pressured to violate the law or department policy. 
Roughly two weeks after the publication of that report, long-time LDEQ ombudsman Roger Ward abruptly resigned and disseminated a scathing seven-page letter detailing what he called “the increasingly erratic and alarmingly vicious behavior” of Giacometto. Ward said he wrote the letter in lieu of providing an exit interview, a long-established LDEQ practice Giacometto ended this year. 
“This is long overdue but fantastic news for the DEQ institutionally and its employees,” Ward said in an email reacting to Friday’s news. “Ms. Giacometto’s tenure at DEQ has been a nightmare for both new and career employees at the agency. The damage she has done to the agency is immense and it is a shame that it took so many complaints and departures to finally get the governor to address her egregious and narcissistic behavior. DEQ employees are rejoicing over her departure and are thrilled that the Governor has chosen Courtney Burdette as Giacometto’s replacement. Unlike Giacometto, Courtney has the intellect and temperament to lead the agency.”
Top financial official the latest to depart from Louisiana Dept. of Environmental Quality

Ward’s earlier polemic reinforced a similar departing letter from former LDEQ Undersecretary Chandra Pidgeon, who left the agency in March 2024 after just weeks of being hired. Pigeon similarly complained about Giacometto’s “harassment of longtime employees” and other actions.
“I have worked for 23 years for the state of Louisiana, and I have never encountered a leader so destructive, calculating, and callous,” she wrote.
None of that stopped the governor from praising Giacometto’s leadership throughout her time in office and again in his news release Friday.
“I want to sincerely thank Aurelia for her dedicated service to our State and the Department of Environmental Quality. Aurelia prioritized environmental improvements to our air, land, and water, while also keeping a focus on the jobs and businesses that often suffer from red-tape and overregulation,” Landry said. “We are grateful for her actions to improve the Department and wish her the best in her next endeavor.”
Burdette, Giacometto’s replacement, first joined the legal team at LDEQ in January 2014. She served as a permits supervisor of the department’s legal division before becoming general counsel in 2020 and later executive counsel.
Her experience also includes working as an attorney with the Louisiana Board of Ethics, and she was previously an assistant state attorney general who defended the state in a variety of tort cases, according to the governor’s office.
Burdette received a bachelor’s degree in English from Howard University and her law degree from LSU.
This is a developing story.

Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Hamden, co-chair of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, where the legislation originated as a committee bill with no individual  sponsor, told senators it was designed to “incentivize individuals to serve on our boards.”
No one asked if there is a dearth of individuals willing to accept a seat on one of the 16 quasi-public authorities that oversee, among other things, the Connecticut Lottery, Bradley International Airport and, yes, the insurance exchange whose mission is to help people find affordable health coverage.
The bill is similar to a provision slipped into a 235-page budget bill last year by a person or persons unknown, at least to the public, and then removed by leaders amid press inquiries. Such items, which often are drawn with a specific constituent or constituency in mind, are colorfully known at the Capitol as “rats.”
The rat was resurrected with a greater measure of transparency in Senate Bill 1384, a 13-line piece of legislation clearly labeled: “An Act Allowing Board Members of Quasi-Public Agencies to Obtain Health Insurance Coverage Under the State Employee Plan.”
But the exercise of going through the full legislative process — vetting by a committee and a public hearing — yielded no answer to basic questions about the bill’s origin and necessity: Where did it come from? Who sought it?
The Senate passed the bill on a 20-14 vote, with three Democrats joining all 11 Republicans in opposition. Two of the three Democratic dissenters, Sen. Matt Lesser of Middletown and Sen. Martha Marx of New London, also had voted against it in committee. 
Neither spoke during the debate in the Senate or in committee, but Marx said in an interview Friday, “No one could tell me the reason why we were doing that bill.”
Last year’s version only covered four quasi-public authorities, among them the Connecticut Airport Authority, whose board members include Vincent Mauro Jr., the New Haven Democratic chair and former chief of staff to Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
Mauro, now a government affairs advisor employed by McCarter & English, a New Jersey law firm with a law and lobbying presence in Connecticut, New York, and Washington D.C., said he was unaware of Senate Bill 1384 and had no role in its passage.
“I have good health insurance,” he said.
At the Capitol, there is no way to trace the DNA of legislation, aside from the record produced by legislative sponsors, advocates and opponents, public hearing testimony and debates in committee and on the floor. SB 1384 generated none of that. 
It was one of a dozen bills on a public hearing agenda of the insurance committee in March, but a review of the transcript shows no mention of the bill, pro or con. There was no written testimony offering praise, criticism or analysis from the quasi-publics, which would bear most of the cost of health care premiums.
Behind the scenes, the bill apparently generated no discussion among the lawmakers who screen bills before they come for a vote in committee, as SB 1384 did on March 13, the last day the Insurance and Real Estate Committee sent bills to the floor.
As is the case with all committee meetings, a video record is available on CT-N.
“I don’t remember going over this bill in screening or talking about it,” Rep. Cara Pavalock-D’Amato, R-Bristol, told fellow committee members in March. She did remember the same idea surfaced a year or two ago, “I think, as a rat.”
Cabrera ignored the rat reference and briefly explained the bill as providing board members access to the state employee plan for the duration of their service, requiring them to pay the same share of the premium as employees, which averages 15%.
“Who put in this bill?” Pavalock-D’Amato asked. “Does anybody know where this bill originated from?”
Cabrera noted there were 16 quasi-publics listed at the bottom of the bill.
She said she understood that. 
“But where is this bill coming from?” she asked. “Is there anybody specific, or any group, that has pushed this bill?”
“So, it was a bill that I originally spearheaded,” Cabrera said, adding he had been “talking to several legislators.”
That was the extent of the origin story of SB 1384.
Rep. Kerry Wood, D-Rocky Hill, the House co-chair of the committee, told Cabrera at the meeting she was willing to move the bill out of committee to the Senate floor but offered no assurance of voting for passage if it reached the House.
“I am going to reluctantly support this bill to get it moving forward,” Wood said then. “But I have said this over and over again, that I would like to see us stop putting bills forward to add anyone that needs health insurance to the state employee plan.”
She reiterated her reluctance to support the bill Thursday after the Senate voted and Cabrera briefly met with Wood outside the House chamber. Wood said she was unsure the bill would get called for a floor vote in the House — of what she would do if it did.
Tom Swan, the executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, typically applauds anything that expands availability to health care. Not so this time, even though he could be a potential beneficiary. He sits on the board of a quasi-public, the State Education Resource Center.
“We support opening up the state employee health plan for everybody, not just political insiders,” Swan said of CCAG. He laughed and added, “As a board member of a quasi-public, I’ll decline the opportunity to enroll if presented.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/capitollastnight-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Despite possibly facing contempt sanctions, Attorney General James Uthmeier won’t tell law enforcement to comply with a federal judge’s order suspending an immigration law that led to the arrest of a U.S. citizen.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams is considering holding Uthmeier in contempt over his greenlighting of arrests under a law making it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person to enter the state as an “unauthorized alien” — despite her order temporarily blocking enforcement.
The law adds heightened penalties for re-entry.
In his first acknowledgement of the possible sanctions reported Tuesday, Uthmeier told Fox News Digital that he won’t tell law enforcement to “stop fulfilling their constitutional duties.” The attorney general’s press secretary didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment from the Florida Phoenix.
“I do not believe an AG should be held in contempt for respecting the rule of law and appropriate separation of powers,” Uthmeier said. “The ACLU is dead set on obstructing President Donald Trump’s efforts to detain and deport illegals, and we are going to fight back. We will vigorously defend our laws and advance President Trump’s agenda on illegal immigration.”
U.S. judge slams state AG for calling court’s block on immigration law illegitimate

Williams scheduled a hearing on May 29 in the Miami federal court to discuss sanctions against Uthmeier over his defiance of her court order in his April 23 letter to law enforcement stating that there wasn’t a legitimate order stopping them from arresting people under the entry and reentry law.
But that April 23 letter was a pivot from another letter Uthmeier sent five days earlier, telling law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, and police chiefs that they shouldn’t arrest anyone under SB 4C, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed on Feb. 13 and Williams temporarily blocked on April 4.
“Color me surprised and shocked,” Williams said, asking what had happened in the five days between the letters, during a Tuesday hearing.
His office did not say whether Uthmeier would attend the hearing. Uthmeier has been attorney general since February. DeSantis appointed his former chief of staff to replace Ashley Moody after her ascension to the U.S. Senate, another appointment by the governor.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Law’s suspension
Along with the contemplation of sanctions, Williams on Tuesday suspended the law for the remainder of the litigation. However, the defendants — Uthmeier, the statewide prosecutor, and state attorneys — almost immediately filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. They’ve also asked Williams to remove her block.
The Florida Immigrant Coalition, The Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought the suit against the state claiming the law is unconstitutional because federal law governs entry into the country.
“This case is about more than one law — it’s about whether our leaders will follow the Constitution,” said Amy Godshall, an immigrants’ rights attorney at the ACLU of Florida, in a press release Wednesday.
Americans for Immigrant Justice and the Community Justice Project attorneys also represent the plaintiffs.
Uthmeier’s argument is that the court’s order doesn’t apply to law enforcement, including the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Florida Highway Patrol, because those entities are not named defendants and he lacks authority to discipline them.
Still, Williams showed irritation with that argument Tuesday, saying Uthmeier’s statements on social media showed he exercises authority over law enforcement agencies.
The defendants’ position that arrests should continue even if prosecutors can’t carry forward the cases raised grave constitutional concerns with due process, Williams wrote in her order.
Continued arrests following the suspension of the law had also prompted frustration from Williams, who mentioned in her order the arrest of a U.S. citizen in Leon County.
An FHP trooper arrested Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, on April 16. The case garnered national attention following the Florida Phoenix’s reporting of the arrest without probable cause and Lopez-Gomez’s subsequent release from the Leon County Jail.
No arrests under the suspended law have taken place since Williams further clarified on April 18 that her order applies to law enforcement, Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey DeSousa told Williams during the Tuesday hearing.

Prison staff, state human services employees, lawmakers, judicial officials and community providers spent a morning learning about the complicated process of getting out of prison. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s first reentry simulation mimics the bureaucratic morass of leaving prison.","Participants at a reentry simulation hosted by the Vermont Department of Corrections attempt to receive forms of identification. By Ethan Weinstein/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — About 95% of people incarcerated in Vermont will one day leave prison. But getting out — and staying out — relies on a system that often appears rigged against those reentering society. “The system as it’s built today forces individuals to jump through hoops that many of us in this room would struggle through, even in the best of circumstances,” Nick Deml, Vermont Department of Corrections commissioner, told participants at the state’s first ever reentry simulation. More than 50 people, including prison staff, state human services employees, lawmakers, judicial officials and community social services providers spent Friday morning reenacting the brutal bureaucracy people leaving prison face every day. Those exiting incarceration often start life from scratch — forced to acquire basic identification, obtain employment and find housing —  all while battling food insecurity and lack of transportation. The morning’s simulation, which led participants through the cascading steps of reentry, was the brainchild of Maurice Q. Jones, chair of the Philadelphia Reentry Coalition. Jones spent years of his life incarcerated and has devoted the years since helping improve reentry services.  “This is a way for folks to gain empathy to effectuate change,” he said in an interview, describing the event. “When I came home, there was almost zero hope. And I felt like there was a greater need to do this work than to do anything else.”   Inside the Capitol Plaza Hotel, attendees began the session by each adopting the identity of someone just leaving prison, outlined in a series of provided materials. Those documents described the person’s criminal history, housing (or lack thereof), financial situation, employment status, probation requirements, and existing forms of ID. Across four 15-minute “weeks,” each participant needed to complete a variety of tasks, like passing drug screenings, attending Alcoholics Anonymous and counseling, and meeting with a probation officer, all while trying to find employment and stay out of trouble. During “week one,” the line to acquire a birth certificate, Social Security card and state ID snaked across the hotel conference room. During every interaction, participants needed to turn over “transportation cards” representing their ride to the appointment, each of which cost money. And even small transactions like filling out forms came with fees. Low on cash? Donate blood plasma up to twice per week, or pawn a guitar or laptop — just don’t expect much money in return. In almost every instance, an interaction required three forms of ID. Between “weeks,” participants vented about the orchestrated chaos. They’d failed to pay rent, forcing them to report to a shelter. People skipped meals, missed probation appointments, stood next in line for an appointment only to hear the closing bell. At times, the futility of every step appeared to baffle attendees. One participant voiced frustration that despite submitting to three drug tests, she was told she never submitted a test at all, barring her from employment. She thought the hiccup in the simulation was unrealistic.“In real life, they wouldn’t be able to lie,” she said.Katie Jones, a recovery coaching supervisor at Turning Point Center of Central Vermont, who was volunteering at the simulation, suggested otherwise.“You might be surprised.”By the fourth round, some attendees appeared too frustrated to continue. Large sheets of paper meant for participants to write down feelings and impressions started to fill with exasperation: “headache,” “overwhelmed,” “defeated,” “cheated,” “jail is easier.”To Timothy Burgess, an advocate for incarcerated people in Vermont who is himself formerly incarcerated, the simulation’s hair-tearing nature rang true. On Friday, he found himself on the other side of the system, playing the part of probation officer. As he watched the red-faced participants fumble through the process, he couldn’t help but empathize with POs, and he hoped the event might inspire change. “This is an amazing opportunity.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s first reentry simulation mimics the bureaucratic morass of leaving prison.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vermont-DOC-reentry-simulation-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C729&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

Interview: Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita Drops A Bombshell On Why Indiana Immigration Bill Died… pic.twitter.com/jqrUH2fRCj

Rokita, in an archived April 30 interview with conservative radio host Casey Hendrickson, said the bill “stalled” because “someone had a personal grudge against the language,” naming Fort Wayne Sen. Liz Brown as the barrier. 
“… (She) told me one of the reasons was she’s got a family member who’s an illegal alien,” Rokita told Hendrickson.
In a statement shared with the Indiana Capital Chronicle, a spokesperson for Brown called the claim “blatantly false.”
“Senator Brown does not have an illegal alien relative. This claim by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita is blatantly false, and is meant to be misleading to Indiana constituents to make them think that Senator Brown has a personal conflict in performing her duties as Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee,” said her legislative office said. “These public erroneous statements are made in an attempt to hurt the credibility and transparency needed and expected in the Indiana state legislative process.”
Brown went on to confirm that she’d filed an official grievance and request for an investigation into Rokita’s comments with the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission.
Relevant background
The underlying bill, House Bill 1531, would have required local law enforcement officers to comply with federal detainer requests for undocumented immigrants. It would have also banned employers from hiring unauthorized residents. 
Though the bill passed out of the House on a 64-26 vote, it never got a hearing in the Senate, where it was assigned to Brown’s committee. As the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brown has the power to select which bills get a hearing — though bills can be reassigned to other committees to circumvent a chair. 
When author Rep. J.D. Prescott was asked about the bill’s demise by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, he referred questions to Brown. 
Brown, an attorney, said she’d shared concerns with Rokita about the legislation “early in the legislative process.” The statement cited the condensed timeline during a budget-writing session and said Hoosiers had shared issues regarding potential impacts, including the possibility of a conflict with federal law.
Rokita weighs in on federal education moves, Indiana immigration bill

Instead, the office pointed to her support for House Enrolled Act 1393, which would require local law enforcement to notify federal immigration authorities about undocumented immigrants in custody.
“(Brown) commends President Trump for the decisive actions he has taken federally to stop the flow of illegal immigration,” the statement concluded.
Rokita fired back, saying in a statement that Brown either “provided inaccurate or unclear information to me and others in the past, or she is backtracking now.”
“As for a disciplinary complaint, Liz can get in line. She didn’t give my office the authority to investigate illegal aliens, but she wants others to investigate me over comments she made. How ironic,” Rokita said. “This is also another example of weaponization of the Indiana court system to attempt to silence me and the people of this state who are tired of sending representatives to Indianapolis who don’t really represent them.”
He went on to accuse the disciplinary commission of encouraging “this political lawfare” by endorsing political candidates, making donations and accepting complaints from “politically partisan people.” 
Rokita has faced the disciplinary commission before. He continues to litigate a case in which he called a practicing OB-GYN an “activist acting as a doctor” after she mentioned seeing a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio travel to Indiana for an abortion. She was later fined by the Medical Licensing Board for sharing patient information — a move supported by Rokita. 
Though reprimanded by the state’s Supreme Court justices, a subsequent press release from Rokita’s office and his public statements have prompted further scrutiny.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s snowpacks melted a month earlier than usual, making a bad water situation worse for New Mexico’s rivers and the people and ecosystems depending on them.
Climate change delivered a double-whammy on top of record low snow for New Mexico, said Andrew Mangham, a senior service hydrologist for National Weather Service in Albuquerque.
The ripple of the rapid melt has hurt Utah and Colorado as well, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration May 1 drought report. Governors for Washington state and Utah declared states of emergencies for drought in their states.

Federal projections for the upper Rio Grande expect only 12% of normal water from snow will make it to the river. Snow accounts for three-quarters of the river’s supply.
“We’ve already seen the bump in all of the rivers from snowmelt, that peak flow is already past us now,” Mangham said, estimating the state experienced the second-driest winter in 130 years. “In terms of volume going through any point on the river, our forecasts all show it’s somewhere between a third to a half of what is normal.”
New Mexico’s meager snowpack and current water conditions bode poorly for fire season, as windy and hot conditions are expected to continue, and the lack of winter moisture left forests drier than usual.
“We’re looking at a nightmare of a fire weather season, I’m not gonna sugarcoat that,” Mangham said.
Overall, the short term forecasts predict New Mexico’s weather to be warmer, drier and windier, although possible storms could cause some spring flooding — such as in the Ruidoso burn scar this weekend.
Long range forecasts paint a potentially brighter picture for the seasonal summer rains, which are possibly going to be stronger than usual in the western part of the state, while the remainder is looking like it will be typical.
“But we still gotta make it through the spring to get to monsoon season,” Mangham said.

SPRINGFIELD — Two Democratic leaders in the Illinois Senate openly expressed their disagreement this week about Gov. JB Pritzker’s proposal to allow community colleges to offer four-year bachelor’s degree programs in certain high-demand employment fields.

The exchange between Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, of Westchester, and Sen. Cristina Castro, of Elgin, who chairs the powerful Senate Executive Committee, took place during a hearing on an unrelated bill that would overhaul the way Illinois funds public universities. But it offered a public view of the reasons why the baccalaureate proposal, which Pritzker touted in his budget address in February, has so far failed to advance in the General Assembly.

Both the university funding proposal (Senate Bill 13 and House Bill 1581) and the community college proposal (HB 3717 and SB 2482) are intended to stem the spiraling cost to students and their families of obtaining a four-year college degree.

The funding proposal calls for increasing state funding for universities to reduce their reliance on tuition and fees. The community college proposal is intended to make certain four-year degrees available through lower-cost institutions and more accessible to older, nontraditional students who don’t live near a four-year institution.

The university funding plan, sponsored by Lightford, was the subject of a Senate committee hearing Wednesday. The bill allowing community colleges to offer four-year baccalaureate degrees did not advance out of a House committee before a March 21 deadline.

During Wednesday’s hearing, Lightford appeared with a panel of university presidents from Chicago State, Western Illinois, Illinois State and Northern Illinois universities, and the Southern Illinois University System – all of whom support the funding proposal but oppose the community college baccalaureate plan.

“If we're thinking about students’ basic needs, we also need to be thinking about the students that don't necessarily go to the four-year schools,” Castro said to the panel. “If students are really the focus, why are you guys opposed to the (four)-year baccalaureate degrees?”

“I’d like to answer your question, madam chair, because I believe it has zero to do with what we're trying to accomplish here,” Lightford replied.

She said the university funding proposal was the product of four years of negotiations that were intended to address a specific set of issues facing universities – namely, the adequacy and equity of their funding systems. The community college proposal, she argued, would draw students away from universities that are already struggling to maintain enrollment levels.

“Community college students need to stay at the two-year community college level, and then students who are going for a bachelor's degree should stay at the university level,” Lightford said. “Because what happens is, when you begin to offer four-year programs at a two-year school, those students who would traditionally go to the four-year university, we’ll lose those students to the community college level.”

During the exchange with Castro, Lightford referred to the community college proposal as “your bill,” even though Castro is not listed as a sponsor or cosponsor of the Senate version. Castro corrected Lightford, saying: “To be fair, it is the governor's bill. This is one of his initiatives that he has been working on.”

But Lightford said the governor “doesn’t push a button on the floor or in a committee.”

“I like the governor,” she said. “He’s probably my favorite. … But this isn’t that bill.”

Dan Mahony, president of the SIU System, added that he does not oppose the concept of community colleges offering bachelor’s degrees, and said negotiations are continuing on that proposal. He said he wants to make sure the final plan “doesn't pit our universities and community colleges against each other in a way that's unproductive and not good for taxpayers and not good for students.”

“We want to do something that actually is productive, and that's what we're working towards, and we'll continue to work towards,” he said

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature intends to use investment revenue to pay for the implementation of Proposition 130, the measure voters approved last fall to direct $350 million to law enforcement.
Under a bill nearing final passage, local law enforcement agencies would get at least $15,000 per year to use for recruitment, continuing education and additional compensation. Surviving spouses or family members of an officer killed during duty would receive a $1 million survivor’s benefit.
To pay for it, members of the bipartisan Joint Budget Committee want to send $500 million to the Public Employees Retirement Association to invest.
“The bill before you represents a fair and faithful, balanced implementation of the voters’ intent, while ensuring that we can continue to fund equally-important priorities across our state budget and maintain our necessary reserves,” Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat, told the House Appropriations Committee on Thursday.

Proposition 130, backed by the conservative nonprofit Advance Colorado, passed with about 53% of the vote last November. That means lawmakers needed to grapple with its implementation during an ultra-tight budget year in which they already faced a $1.2 billion gap.
Senate Bill 25-310 would establish the Peace Officer Support and Training Fund, which would receive an initial transfer of $15 million in general fund money next year. Then, $500 million from the state’s general fund reserve — money set aside as a buffer for emergencies — would get sent to PERA to invest. Up to $35 million generated from that investment would be sent to the support fund annually, and other revenue would be used to offset a portion of what the state owes to PERA for pension liability every year.
The plan is to always have $15 million per year in the law enforcement support fund. Rep. Rick Taggart, a Grand Junction Republican, said that the average return on PERA investments is about 7%. An expected average annual return of $35 million on the investment would mean the Legislature would fulfill its $350 million obligation under Proposition 130 in 10 years.
“This is how we are using our existing state assets to generate revenues to meet the voters’ intent,” Bird said.
Local law enforcement agencies would get at least $15,000 per year, and if there is enough revenue available, additional money using a formula based on department size. That would begin in December 2026. Agencies would need to prove compliance with allowable spending through an annual audit.
Adam Turk with the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police told lawmakers in committee that the funding mechanism would not kick in fast enough.
“The funding structure as currently written, delays the impact of this critical investment far beyond the time frame in which departments need it most,” he said. “The timeline does not align with the pressing public safety, staffing and resource challenges agencies are facing today. Proposition 130 was passed by voters with the expectation that the funding would help stabilize and strengthen law enforcement capacity now, not decades into the future.”
The Colorado Municipal League, Colorado Counties Inc. County Sheriffs of Colorado and the Colorado Fraternal Order of Police support the bill.
It passed the Senate unanimously on Tuesday. It needs to clear the House floor, including debate and preliminary voice vote followed by a final recorded vote on a separate day, before the end of the legislative session on May 7. Representatives began that debate on Thursday, but the preliminary vote was delayed on that day and again on Friday morning.

,DC,2025-05-02 20:01:45+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,States’ nuclear energy growth needs federal action to follow Trump’s vocal support,Allison Prang,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-nuclear-energy-growth-needs-federal-action-follow-trumps-vocal-support,,"WASHINGTON —  President Donald Trump and his team have signaled a strong interest in continuing to strengthen federal support for nuclear power, an energy source Democratic states are increasingly open to expanding.The administration’s loudly pro-nuclear position creates a rare point of overlap between Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, whose signature legislation funded hundreds of millions in tax credits for low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear power.Trump during his first roughly three months in office issued multiple executive orders mentioning nuclear energy, casting his broad energy strategy as a way to expand the country’s power resources and shore up its security. State lawmakers are also pushing their own policy moves, sometimes just in an effort to set themselves up to embrace nuclear power at some point in the future.“There are a lot of really positive signals,” said Rowen Price, senior policy adviser for nuclear energy at Third Way, a centrist policy think tank.But Price said she’s concerned that support for nuclear power could be swept up in bigger political fights, such as many congressional Republicans’ goal of axing clean-energy tax credits in Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The administration’s broad cuts to the federal workforce could also eventually hurt the government's nuclear ambitions, she added.The promise of a nuclear resurgence in the United States isn’t a new goal for the industry or its backers in Washington, D.C., but how successful efforts to expand nuclear power generation will be in the U.S. — a metric that hasn’t budged from around 20% in decades — remains to be seen.Americans’ support for the energy source, meanwhile, is just short of its record high, a recent Gallup Poll found. And more blue states have also started to embrace nuclear power, which has traditionally been more favored by Republicans, to reach climate goals and grow electricity capacity amid anticipated increases in demand.But even as interest in states grows, the cost of building nuclear infrastructure remains an impediment only the federal government is positioned to help scale.‘Renaissance of nuclear’Energy Secretary Chris Wright in April talked about the administration’s desire to elevate nuclear power by making it easier to test reactors, delivering fuel to next-generation nuclear firms and utilizing the department’s Loan Programs Office to help bring nuclear power projects online.“We would like to see a renaissance of nuclear,” Wright said at the news outlet Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington. “The conditions are there and the administration is going to do everything we can to lean in to help commercial businesses and customers launch nuclear.”

Wright said he wants the department to help launch 10 to 20 new nuclear reactors to get the industry moving again and to bring down costs. The department’s loan office could make debt investments alongside large-scale data center companies that use massive amounts of power to build nuclear projects and then exit those deals after the projects are built, allowing the office to recycle that funding, he said.The department recently announced that it approved a third loan disbursement to reopen the Palisades Nuclear Plant in Covert, Michigan, which Holtec has been working on doing for the last few years.Last month, the department said it was reopening $900 million in funding to help companies working on small modular reactors after changing some of the Biden administration’s guidance on the program.Federal workforce cutsThird Way’s Price noted that a portion of staffers at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission — which she described as already “tightly constrained” — are eligible for retirement either now or in the next five years.Workforce cuts at the Energy Department and elsewhere could also hurt efforts to grow the nuclear power sector, she said.“Frankly, all of the verbal support from this administration for nuclear only matters if they're actually going to put forward and implement policies that support it,” Price said. “We need to make sure that they do it.”An Energy Department spokesperson said in an email that it ""is conducting a department-wide review to ensure all activities follow the law, comply with applicable court orders and align with the Trump administration’s priorities.”The agency said it didn’t have a final count on how many staffers have left the department through its resignation program, but noted that it doesn’t necessarily approve all requests. The department didn’t comment on how many staffers focused on nuclear energy have been laid off.Nuclear programs were among those affected by the Trump administration’s pausing of federal programs and funding, said David Brown, senior vice president of federal government affairs and public policy at Constellation Energy, which runs the biggest fleet of nuclear plants in the country. But Brown said that even so, the industry is coming out on top.“I think what we are seeing is that as they work through their various review(s) of programs that they’re greenlighting the nuclear stuff,” Brown said.Federal support crucial, but politics trickyLawmakers on Capitol Hill could also change the outcome for industry, for better or worse.Wright, in his remarks last month, said he hopes Congress will take action to help expand nuclear energy, and said lawmakers could do so in the budget reconciliation package on which the U.S. House has started to work.Republican House members have not yet released text of the sections of the package that will deal with energy policy. Wright said support for nuclear power could be included in the reconciliation package, but some advocates are also worried that the package, or the annual appropriations bills, are the exact kind of political battles that efforts to support nuclear power, like the tax credits, could get tied up in.Some state lawmakers point to financial support from the federal government as essential for the industry to grow, even if states make their own headway to build support for nuclear power.Colorado state Rep. Alex Valdez, a Democrat who sponsored a bill signed into law this session to include nuclear in the state’s definition of clean energy, said he hopes the administration follows through on its admiration of nuclear power with funding for states.“Generally, states do not have the financial resources the federal government does,” Valdez said. “It's going to be the federal government that puts their investments behind these things, and that's what's going to enable states as a whole to be able to move forward on them.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-05-02 16:11:38.370437

“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”

Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”

HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.

What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Officials said no. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Rutgers University officials have refused a state lawmaker’s request that they reconsider actor Ramy Youssef as a commencement speaker because his support for the Palestinian people and a Gaza ceasefire is “alienating and isolating” for Jewish students.
Assemblyman Avi Schnall (D-Ocean) sent a letter to Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway and the university’s board of governors calling Youssef “polarizing” and “anti-Israel.”

Picking Youssef to address Rutgers-Newark graduates at their May 22 commencement “sends an unfortunate and deeply hurtful message,” especially as antisemitism climbs on college campuses, Schnall wrote.
“Graduation should not be marred by controversy or by actions that leave part of the student body feeling uncomfortable, scared or unwelcome,” Schnall wrote. “It should be a day that lifts every student up.”
Rutgers officials, though, said commencement speakers and honorary degree recipients are “thoughtfully reviewed” and recommended by a campus-wide committee that includes students, faculty, and staff. Youssef also will receive an honorary doctor of fine arts degree at the event.
“Ramy Youssef is a celebrated writer and artist who has deep ties to New Jersey and to Rutgers-Newark, which he attended,” the university said in a statement. “His selection as commencement speaker at Rutgers-Newark reflects a tradition of honoring individuals who embody resilience, creativity, and connection to our community.”
Rutgers announced last week that Youssef, a practicing Muslim and Egyptian-American actor and comedian who was raised in Rutherford, would be the keynote commencement speaker for Newark graduates.
“Thirteen years ago I took a ‘break’ from Rutgers to pursue acting. The break is now over. I am honored to be giving this year’s commencement speech, and to finally receive a college degree,” Youssef said in that announcement. “Thank you Rutgers for this honor, and for making my parents feel like the three semesters of tuition they paid for was actually worth it.”
Last month, he told The New York Times that he has fielded plenty of criticism for his comments about Israel and Palestine. But he defended them as “completely inoffensive” and lamented “a massive power imbalance” in the Gaza conflict.
Rutgers has caught similar flak, most notably over its response to pro-Palestinian solidarity encampments on campus last year that led to Holloway getting grilled by lawmakers in both New Jersey and Washington, D.C.
While Rutgers subsequently banned such encampments and suspended a Palestinian student group that was involved, at least two other Jewish lawmakers have targeted New Jersey’s flagship university for criticism about its encampment response and related issues.
State Sen. Robert Singer (R-Ocean) last month called for a freeze of public funding for Rutgers for “ignoring antisemitism.” U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) also has called on Rutgers officials to cancel campus speakers he deemed antisemitic.
College campuses nationally have seen incidents of both antisemitism and Islamophobia climb since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.
At Rutgers, the U.S. Department of Justice in January ordered reforms after it found the university created a “hostile environment” for Jewish, Palestinian, and other students based on national origin. The Anti-Defamation League recently gave Rutgers a grade of “D” for its “deficient” approach to protecting Jewish students from antisemitism.

District 1 includes areas in Brown, Day, Marshall and Roberts counties. Reder was elected to his first term last November and served during the 2025 legislative session. He is a Navy veteran and sat on the House Military and Veterans Affairs, Taxation and Transportation committees.
The two bills he introduced, one of which was signed into law by Rhoden, related to military members and veteran benefits. The new law allows non-South Dakota residents who are veterans to purchase three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl licenses in the state.
Reder announced his resignation through social media on Thursday due to “personal and professional reasons.”
He had faced questions in the news media and on political blogs about his residency status, but did not address that in his resignation announcement.
Another legislative seat opened recently in District 22, which includes areas in Beadle, Spink and Clark counties, when Rhoden selected Sen. David Wheeler, R-Huron, to become a judge. Rhoden will make appointments for the open seats.

CHICAGO — Michelle Nolasco, a 20-year-old DePaul University student from Orland Park, Illinois, held a sign that read: “I was supposed to be at school … Instead, I am here, fighting for mi familia y mi gente,” meaning “my family and my people.”

“I feel like being in class is not as important as being here,” Nolasco, a child of undocumented immigrants from Mexico, said Thursday. She was among thousands who gathered in Union Park to mark May Day with speeches and signs before marching through downtown to Grant Park later in the afternoon, where speakers — including Mayor Brandon Johnson — addressed the rally.

May Day — also known as International Workers’ Day — is a global holiday commemorating the labor rights movement, in which Chicago played a pivotal role.

Across the nation and the world, hundreds of thousands demonstrated Thursday to champion workers’ rights as well as to denounce the Trump administration’s widespread crackdowns on immigration, its economic policies and disruptive global tariffs.

Immigration has become a major focus of May Day rallies in the U.S. since 2006, when roughly one million people — nearly half a million in Chicago alone — marched as part of a nationwide movement against tough, proposed, federal anti-immigration reforms. The legislation, called the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act, would have criminalized living in the U.S. without legal permission, making it a felony.

Nearly 20 years after those first rallies, the crowd in Chicago erupted Thursday into chants of  “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here!” Some said the struggle was all too familiar.

“I was one of the main conveners of the 2006 mega march on March 10 and then on May 1 of 2006, and having to fight against it all over again is obviously a deja vu,” said Omar Lopez, 80, a member of the Central Committee of the Consejo de Resistencia en Defensa del Inmigrante, the body that made the initial call for people to take to the streets.

Since President Donald Trump was sworn into office in January, his administration has launched immigration raids across the country, urged others to self-deport, canceled foreign students’ visas, and even deported legal residents without due process. “We will close the border. We will stop the invasion of illegals into our country,” Trump said during his campaign.

From April 21-26, federal and local authorities arrested 1,120 Floridians in an effort dubbed “Operation Tidal Wave,” according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier that month, the administration sent over 200 migrants to a notorious maximum-security prison in El Salvador in a wave of arbitrary arrests and deportations that 20 United Nations human rights experts deemed “contrary to international law.”

“This is a life-and-death question for the labor movement and for the whole working class, not just for those that are immigrants: It has to do with the unity of the working class and our ability to fight for our own interests,” said David Rosenfeld, a Chicago-based railroad worker who is a member of the Socialist Workers Party and the SMART Transportation Division. “That's why I'm particularly proud of my union, the SMART Transportation union, which has been standing up for our member, Kilmar Abrego García.”

García, a first-year apprentice with the union with no criminal convictions who was living in Maryland, was wrongfully deported to his native El Salvador — despite a 2019 court order shielding him from being sent there due to the risk of persecution by local gangs that had terrorized his family. The Trump administration called the deportation “an administrative error” but contended García was a member of the MS-13 gang, an allegation a federal judge questioned and the man’s wife and lawyer denied. Officials later added domestic abuse to the list of allegations, actions his wife acknowledged but explained, adding that “Kilmar is a loving partner and father.”

A federal judge, an appeals court and the Supreme Court have all ordered the government to facilitate García’s return to the country, but the administration has argued in court that it had no means of doing so.

Although immigration became a focus of the event, it was not the only one.

“We have groups that have other grievances against what's coming out of Washington, and they're also using this as a vehicle to express their grievances,” Lopez said. “Now, we see a broader coalition than we did in 2006.”

Some organizations were planning to organize their own May Day events but decided to follow the lead of the Central Committee.

“We were going to put on a May Day march that was specifically geared towards women and fem-identifying workers,” said Jill Manrique, an executive director at Chicago Jobs With Justice. “But when we found out that this was happening, we joined up—we didn't want to split solidarity.”

According to Lopez, this year’s coalition included 175 organizations—from unions to faith-based groups—from across Illinois, including DuPage and McHenry counties and cities like Elgin, Rockford and Aurora. Unlike the recent “Hands Off!” campaign that spanned more than 30 cities throughout the state, the May Day rallies were held only in Chicago and Evanston. Still, many from outside the city joined the Union Park event.

One protester who would give only his first name for fear of retribution, Ashton — a young trans man from Ottawa, Illinois — drove a couple of hours to the event.

“It's absolutely insane that we need to do this,” he said. “I keep seeing people saying, you know, if a child needs to be an activist, we've already failed them, and this is absolutely freaking true.”

Some organizations arranged transportation to bring people from outside the city.

“The eight buses that our organization is bringing are coming mainly from the Southwest suburbs like Bolingbrook, Plainfield, Romeoville, Joliet, Naperville and Lockport,” said Margarita Morelos, a co-founder of Casa Aguascalientes Chicago, a non-profit working to empower the Hispanic community. “But other organizations are having buses coming from other places, like the North Side and the West Side of Chicago.”

The diversity of the organizations, locations and people represented in the rally was reflected in the thousands of handmade signs, which addressed a variety of issues, ranging from LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights to the rights of health care and education workers, as well as U.S. foreign policy toward Israel and Russia.

“The basic message is that we are resisting, we are defending every community and every sector of society,” said Jorge Mujica, another member of the Central Committee of the Consejo de Resistencia en Defensa del Inmigrante. “This is not only about immigrant workers, this is about students, this is about colleges and universities, this is about the health care system. It's about everything that is under attack by the Washington administration.”

Faith Humphrey Hill, a Chicago-based fiber artist, said she struggled with choosing only one issue to focus on when weaving her sign.

“I almost knitted a really long tapestry, like a long scarf that just drags on forever, because I don't know how to sum up everything that upsets me,” she said. “Women's rights is obviously close to home, but I also have a trans child, and so his (Trump’s) attack on trans people really upsets me.

“My kid exists,” she added. “He's trying to erase them, but no, they're a human, and they exist.”

However, a recent report warns that President Donald Trump’s efforts to eliminate those policies are already cutting into the state’s clean energy gains.
Climate Power, a strategic communications firm centered on climate progress, has issued several reports tracking the impacts of Biden’s climate policies across the U.S., repeatedly pointing to Michigan as the state attracting the largest share of clean energy projects, in addition to drawing significant investments and creating thousands of jobs. 
However, in the months since Trump has taken office, the president’s attacks on clean energy policy alongside the impact of his tariff policies have threatened, delayed or outright canceled $14.2 billion in investments alongside 2,667 jobs, the firm’s latest report said.
If congressional Republicans repeal the IRA’s tax credits for clean energy manufacturing, Climate Power warns that $39.85 billion in investments and 25,357 jobs could be lost.

The report also emphasizes that these cuts would harm low-income communities, where companies have announced $13.3 billion in investments, creating 17,245 clean energy jobs. Additionally projects announced in rural communities which are expected to bring $5.8 billion in investment and 2,886 jobs could also be placed at risk. 
While Climate Power has projected that the state will bring in 167,000 new jobs over the next ten years, the loss of federal support and impacts of Trump’s trade war would similarly jeopardize these gains. 
“Trump’s war on clean energy and his chaotic policies have already caused a hemorrhaging of manufacturing jobs in sectors that had been booming for two years,” Lori Lodes, Climate Power’s executive director said in a statement. “Repealing clean energy investments would jeopardize hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs on its own. On top of this crisis of uncertainty, repeal would devastate American manufacturing — halting construction, sending jobs overseas, hiking energy costs, and forfeiting the future to China and our other competitors.”
Of the 74 clean energy projects committed to investing in Michigan, the majority are centered in electric vehicles and batteries, with 35 projects centered on EV manufacturing and 19 on batteries. These sectors were also the largest for jobs, with the battery industry accounting for  46.9% of incoming jobs, while the electric vehicles sector accounts for 32.6%. However, the clean technology sector has drawn the greatest amount of investments, bringing $13.2 billion into the state.

The report also points to several projects in these sectors, including a $1.6 billion battery cell plant in Van Buren Township from Michigan-based Our Next Energy, and General Motors’ plan to retool its Lansing Grand River Plant for electric vehicle production using a $500 million clean energy grant. 
Climate power also noted that more than a third of the clean energy projects coming into Michigan would be housed in districts represented by Republicans in Congress, for a total of $12.5 billion in investments. 
As Republicans work to cut spendings in order to extend Trump’s 2017 tax policy, some House Republicans have spoken out against eliminating the clean energy tax credit, including Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.) whose district expects to see 275 new jobs and over $16 million in investments.
According to a report from Politico, Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) signed onto a letter Thursday calling for House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) to maintain incentives for nuclear energy.

The 16-member panel of Republican and Democratic legislators, state officials and a handful of appointees from both parties will craft policy changes in an effort to evaluate Kansas’ current and future water supply, funding efforts for water projects and potential impacts on the state’s economy.
Republicans announced their appointments Wednesday, which included an official from utility company Evergy, an environmental consultant and the manager of a public groundwater management district in northwest Kansas.
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican said these members are experts in the field with intricate understandings of water issues.
“Water is the essence of life, the foundation upon which Kansas thrives — sustaining our fields, fueling our communities, and nourishing our future — and truly runs through every decision we make, from agriculture to economic development,” Masterson said.
The task force was born out of House Bill 2172, which passed the Senate in March with unanimous bipartisan support and the House with eight Republicans voting against it. The bill had no opponents in committee hearings.
The task force’s water policy recommendations will begin with a preliminary report due by the end of January and end with a final report that must be submitted to the governor and the Legislature by the end of January 2027.
Within the next two months, the task force members must appoint people to a subgroup that would be responsible for modernizing the State Water Resources Planning Act.
The subgroup’s members must be attorneys, engineers, hydrologists, natural resource planners or others with experience with Kansas water issues, according to the legislation.
First passed in 1963 and revamped in the 1980s, the State Water Resources Planning Act and the State Water Plan guide Kansas water management, conservation and development efforts. With drought becoming increasingly apparent in western and central Kansas, including the depletion of the High Plains Aquifer, the task force will address the state’s current and future water needs.
A focus on agriculture and industry is especially important, said House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican.
“To say water is vital to Kansas agriculture, business, and communities would be an understatement, and the input from this Task Force will be key to ensuring this precious resource is available for generations to come,” he said in a Thursday news release.
Gov. Laura Kelly, in her own news release distributed upon signing the task force bill into law in April, said the task force enables lawmakers to evaluate risks to Kansas’ water quality and quantity through a funded, bipartisan group.
“Developing a comprehensive, long-term, and sustainable water program is long overdue and a significant step forward in ensuring Kansas’ water supply is preserved for generations to come,” she said.
Republican leadership’s appointees included three Republican legislators; Jared Morrison, director of Evergy’s water and waste programs; Kansas Chamber board chair Karma Mason; and Shannon Kenyon, the manager of Groundwater Management District No. 4 in northwest Kansas.
Democratic leadership on Tuesday appointed Josh Svaty, a former state legislator and former state agriculture secretary, and Heidi Mehl, the Kansas director of water and agriculture for the Nature Conservancy, an international environmental organization.
The task force also will include three nonvoting members from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, the Kansas Water Office and the Kansas Department of Agriculture.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-P5220469-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-02 16:11:38.370437

“Questions remain” for landowners regarding how to provide access to public land, grazing representative said. Hunters’ attorney encouraged recreators to exercise caution and goodwill if attempting to corner cross. 
The post Corner-crossing experts urge caution for Wyoming recreators in wake of ruling appeared first on WyoFile .","LARAMIE—A March ruling by a federal appeals court in a widely watched corner-crossing case determined that private landowners cannot bar access to public lands with fences, trespass actions or other methods.
Hunters, recreators and public lands advocates celebrated the ruling and its implications for the states within the 10th Circuit — Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Oklahoma and Kansas.
Thursday, however, Ryan Semerad, the attorney who represented the four Missouri hunters in the federal civil lawsuit, urged recreators to exercise caution and goodwill if attempting to corner cross — or step from one piece of public land to another where those two parcels meet at a common corner with two private parcels, in a checkboard pattern of ownership. Wyoming’s checkerboard spans more than 2 million acres. 
“There are limitations to that decision,” Semerad said Thursday during a corner-crossing panel discussion in Laramie. “That doesn’t mean go jump on your side by side … and just have at it. It doesn’t mean you get to go on private property without permission, consent or something else. What it means is that you have reasonable access to step from one section to the next section, so long as you can be situated appropriately, you know where the monument marker is, you know where you’re going and you respect that.”

There are also outstanding questions for landowners, said Wyoming Stock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna, another panelist. His group filed an amicus brief in the case in support of the landowner who sued the Missouri hunters for stepping over, but never touching, Elk Mountain Ranch property. 
“It’s pretty clear that you cannot deny access to these checkerboard lands,” Magagna said. “Does that mean that you have to allow crossing at every corner? If I want to identify one of the four corners that I control as the access point, do I have the liberty to do that? Or if I want to designate a path through the middle of my private land in lieu of granting access across the corners?
“Those are many of the questions that still remain out there to be addressed,” Magagna said. 
As they talked, it became clear that interpretations of the ruling still vary widely. But both urged common sense and respectful communication — traditional tenets of Wyoming hunting etiquette regarding private landowners.
“We need to remember that it’s a culture of cooperation with these lands, and that’s how this is going to work moving forward,” Semerad said.
The panel was part of the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation Summit, a two-day event bringing together outdoor recreation business leaders, public lands agency officials, nonprofits and others to strengthen the burgeoning industry and enhance access to resources. The summit is one product of newly expanded state government support of the outdoor recreation — Wyoming’s Office of Outdoor Recreation helps put it on. 
Appropriately, the panel addressed a legal question that has captivated recreators in Wyoming and the nation.
Hunters, a wealthy landowner, trespass charges 
In 2020, hunters Brad Cape, John Slowensky and Phillip Yeomans corner crossed to hunt on Elk Mountain, then did so again with Zach Smith in 2021.
Carbon County ranch owner Fred Eshelman sued the four men in 2022 for passing through the airspace above his property on their way to hunt.
Eshelman sued to block them, and anyone else, from corner crossing to reach some 11,000 acres of federal and state land enmeshed in his 50-square-mile ranch, a coveted hunting ground known for its abundant wildlife.
The appeals court used this graphic to depict corner crossing. (IU.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)
That set off a series of court challenges and appeals in a case that involved everything from the limits of private property rights to the extent of airspace and the legality of preventing the public from accessing public land. 
With implications not only for the 2.4 million acres of “corner-locked” land in Wyoming, but also for 8.3 million acres across the West, the case gained national attention, particularly among hunters. 
It culminated in March with the appeals court decision. In a unanimous opinion, the three-judge panel sided against Eshelman, citing an act of Congress that preempts Wyoming trespass law. 
Congress enacted the Unlawful Inclosures Act in 1885. “No one may completely prevent or obstruct another from peacefully entering or freely passing over or through public lands,” the act says, according to the appellate judges. 
The act, which explicitly prohibits “obstructing transit over public lands by force, threats, intimidation, or by any fencing or inclosing,” supersedes Wyoming trespass law, the judges ruled. 
What that means in practical terms, Semerad said Thursday, is this: “You can now step from one section of public land to the next. In Wyoming, there is no state law, statute or regulation that can stop you; the federal law would preempt it.”
Questions remain 
Magagna believes the ruling is aimed explicitly at the checkerboard — not islands of public land surrounded by private land elsewhere, he said Thursday. 
Semerad disagreed. “The Unlawful Inclosures Act applies to all public lands,” he said. 
Moderator Dan McCoy, director of the Jay Kemmerer WORTH Institute, asked if the Wyoming Legislature or the state could have a bearing on the issue. 
The Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee will discuss corner crossing when it holds an interim meeting June 5-6 in Dubois.

Though the ruling clearly states the Unlawful Inclosures Act is supreme, Magagna said, “I think where there is opportunity, potentially for the Legislature should they choose to do so, is to better define the tools that are available and the limitations on the use of those tools.” He also brought up land exchanges by which more public land could become accessible without the necessity of corner crossing.  
So what should recreators do if they come across a corner that’s fenced off, McCoy asked.
“If you come across a fenced corner, call me, call the U.S. Attorney’s office because that’s unlawful,” Semerad said. “That is straight up a violation of the Unlawful Inclosures Act.”
The March decision might not be the final word in the corner-crossing case. There is a chance it will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, Semerad said. The earliest the high court could see it is next winter, he said. 
In the meantime, both men stressed a spirit of collaboration when it comes to public land users and private property owners.

“Respect and cooperation is always going to take us much further than if we’re just going to be battling it out all the time,” Semerad said. 
“The real answer to all this, to me and I think to many people I represent,” Magagna added, “is the relationships we build in Wyoming with people, between private landowners and the recreation and outdoor community, particularly the sportsmen, hunters and fishermen. So I think that the key thing, for now at least, is to build those relationships.”

The committee will host its hearing at 1 p.m. in Representatives Hall in the State House, the final formal opportunity for residents to voice their opinions during the budget process. 
Those unable to attend in person may watch a livestream on Youtube. 
The hearing comes as the committee works to finish a version of the budget that can pass the full Senate by June 5. At that point, the Senate’s version will go back to the House, which will likely convene a committee of conference to allow House and Senate leaders to negotiate a final package. The budget will then head to Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who must sign it by June 30, the end of the current state fiscal year. 
In April, the House passed a budget that made deep cuts to the plan recommended by Ayotte — with $643 million less spending than Ayotte’s proposal. House budget writers said the governor had been too rosy with her revenue projections and that the state needed to make hard choices. 
Ayotte has since expressed disagreement with the House’s budget and has called on the Senate to restore some of the cuts, which included the elimination of the Office of the Child Advocate, a watchdog agency over the Division for Children, Youth, and Families; the Human Rights Commission; the Housing Appeals Board; and the state Commission on Aging, among other spending reductions. 
As the Senate Finance Committee begins crafting its own version of the budget, observers are closely watching the Senate Ways and Means Committee, which plans to unveil and vote for the state’s revenue projections next week. Those projections are traditionally more accurate than the House or governor’s projections, because they come after April 15, or Tax Day, and include preliminary data on state business tax returns. 
The Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to vote on the revenue projections on Wednesday; those projections were not publicly available Friday afternoon. The projections will then be used by the Senate Finance Committee to guide their amendments to the House-passed budget. 
A preliminary monthly report from the Department of Administrative Services suggests that business tax revenues in April were 15.6% lower than in April 2024 and 10.2% lower than had been planned for in the last two-year budget, passed in 2023. That decrease — which includes last month’s Tax Day returns — could affect whether, and how much, the Republican-led Senate chooses to reverse the House budget. 
Senate Democrats criticized Senate Republicans for holding only one hearing on the budget and only doing so in Concord. They held their own listening session at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton on April 23.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/springstatehouse25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 16:11:38.370437

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)A measure that Democrats and voting rights advocates say would make it significantly more difficult for citizen-led constitutional amendments to make it on the ballot has passed in the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature.
It now goes to Governor Ron DeSantis desk, where he is expected to quickly sign the measure into law.
“This is the most important bill that we will be hearing in this chamber,” said Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman on Wednesday. “And as you’ve heard, it’s going to greatly restrict the access of the citizens of the state of Florida to be able to address the system.”
The Senate on Friday passed an amended version of HB 1205, 28-9. The House voted 81-30 on Thursday night.
DeSantis said in January that it was a top legislative priority for him this year. The governor and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature argue the measure is needed to combat signature petition fraud that they alleged was exposed last year in the campaigns to pass constitutional amendments regarding legalizing recreational marijuana and abortion rights.
Their proof? A report published in January by the Office of Election Crimes and Security alleging that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights initiative committed crimes related to gathering petitions.
“The report penetrates the smokescreen of out-of-state petition mills who steal citizens’ identity and then hide from Florida prosecutors,” said Panhandle Republican Don Gaetz, co-sponsor of the Senate bill, on Wednesday during floor debate. “The report explains the slippery sidestepping of responsibility of amendment sponsors who pay for it all and then deny it all.”
Jacksonville Democratic Sen. Tracie Davis argued that Republicans were making too much of that report.
“We talk about the fraudulent report,” she said. “You’ve heard that over and over again. The 900-page [report] that shows all of the fraudulent cases. Guess what guys? I have it, too. Seventeen arrests. Twenty-five cases. Most of this is charts. Redacted pages, and so on.”
Vero Beach Republican Sen. Erin Grall, the other co-sponsor of the bill, said on Thursday that the report showed 18 arrests in all, along with hundreds of allegations of petition fraud referred to the Office of Election Crimes and Security that are listed in the document.
Who can participate?
The bill includes a number of proposals that Democrats say will allow only the wealthy to participate in the process of placing a constitutional amendment on the ballot in Florida.
“This bill raises the costs,” said South Florida Democratic Sen. Shevrin Jones on Thursday. “This bill tightens the timeline. This bill adds legal tasks and risks. And lastly, members, this bill absolutely stacks the deck until the only people who can access the process are those who can afford lobbyists and lawyers.”
Floridians strongly supported the two constitutional amendments on last year’s ballot regarding cannabis and abortion rights, with both measure drawing more than 55% of the vote — clear majorities but short of the 60% required for passage in Florida.
“Those pesky amendments 3 and 4 just came too damn close to passing, so, what are we going to do?” said South Florida Sen. Tina Polsky, mimicking what she said top Republicans had in mind. “We’re going to make it so hard, and so expensive, that only corporate interests are going to be able to get a citizen’s initiative on the ballot.”
“Fifty-seven percent of Floridians told us that a six-week abortion ban was extreme and should be overturned,” said Orlando Democratic Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith. “So, instead of taking action when they told us, ‘Do something about this extreme abortion ban,’ we did nothing. Oh, wait, wait. I’m wrong. We did something. We came up with this bill to remind people that we are not listening.”
But Northeast Florida Republican Sen. Jennifer Bradley insisted the bill was absolutely needed.
“This is not a bill to restrict, it is a bill to protect. To make sure that our constitutional system is one of integrity and that it’s free of fraud,” she said. “The bill that is before us does not address imaginary, hypothetical fraud, but known fraud, fraud that has been exposed for us to see.”
What it does
Among the provisions in the bill are:

Requires additional personal identifying information for voters signing petition forms and for applicants for petition circulators, including listing their Florida driver license or ID card number and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers.
Bans people who are not residents of Florida from acting as petition circulators. People who are not U.S. citizens are also banned, as are people who have been convicted of a felony violation and not had their right to vote restored. The sponsors of  an amendment are liable for a $50,000 fine if found to have used such people as petition gatherers.
Requires training for petition circulators.
Requires signed petitions must be returned to the supervisor of elections office within 10 days after the voter signs the form (currently it is 30 days). The petition gatherer will be fined $50 per each day late for each petition form received after 10 days. That fine will be increased to $2,500 for each petition form received if the petition gatherer “acted willfully.”
Those fines will rise to $100 per each day late, up to a maximum of $500, for each petition form signed by a voter on or before Feb. 1 in an election year. That goes up to $5,000 if the petition gatherer acted willfully.
Requires supervisors of elections to notify voters whose signatures are verified and provide an opportunity for such persons to report that their signatures were forged or misrepresented.
Provides for inclusion of the financial impact statement on the petition form and adds the financial impact statement to the issues subject to automatic Supreme Court review.
If a petition gatherer signs someone else’s name to a petition, he or she will be fined $5,000 for each petition.
If the petition gatherer retains a voter’s information for any reason other than for an amendment campaign, they will be subject to a third-degree felony.
A person who collects, delivers, or otherwise physically possesses more than 25 signed petition forms in addition to his or her own signed petition form or a signed petition form belonging to an immediate family member, and who is not registered as a petition circulator, is subject to a third-degree felony.
For any reporting period in which the percentage of petition forms deemed invalid by the supervisor of elections exceeds 25% of the forms received in a particular reporting period, the supervisor must notify the Office of Election Crimes and Security. They will then conduct a preliminary investigation into whether the invalidated petitions are a result of fraud. If warranted, the Office of Election Crimes and Security may report findings to the statewide prosecutor or the state attorney for the judicial circuit where the alleged violation occurred for prosecution.
Bans anyone from the state government from authorizing the expenditure of public funds for a political advertisement or any other communication for a citizen-led constitutional amendment campaign. However, the bill also says that it “does not preclude” state government or a person acting on behalf of the state government from reporting on official actions of the state government in “an accurate, fair, and impartial manner; posting factual information on a government website or in printed materials; hosting and providing information at a public forum; providing factual information in response to an inquiry.”

DeSantis-inspired
The last provision was placed on the bill earlier this year by Sen. Bradley, and follows reports that DeSantis used taxpayers funds last year for public service ads and otherwise used government resources to campaign against Amendments 3 and 4.
South Florida Sen. Jason Pizzo, who left the Democratic Party a week ago to become a political independent, told the bill sponsors on Thursday that if they could acknowledge that state elected officials used taxpayer resources last year, they would have his vote.
“The Bradley provision which we included in this bill was inspired by individuals who work for the state government and are part of the state government now,” Sen. Gaetz said. “And they engaged in behavior that will now be unlawful, and will now be prevented if we pass this bill.”
With that acknowledgement, Pizzo joined all the Senate Republicans in supporting the measure. All Democrats opposed it.
The law will go into effect immediately after the governor signs the bill. That means it will affect organizations working to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2026, such as Florida Decides Healthcare, working to have Florida expand Medicaid.
“This legislation is not about ‘transparency’ or ‘reform.’ It’s a calculated move by out-of-touch politicians trying to rewrite the rules to further keep the power in their hands and away from everyday citizens. They’re attempting to silence Floridians because they’re afraid of answering to We The People,” said Florida Decides Healthcare Campaign Manager Mitch Emerson.
“Florida Decides Healthcare has fought tirelessly to protect the voice of the people and we’re not going anywhere. We will continue to fight for the freedom of every Floridian to access the healthcare they need because no politician gets to decide which rights we’re allowed to keep. The people of Florida deserve better than this bad-faith attempt to silence our voices.”
Brad Ashwell, Florida director of All Voting is Local, took aim at one specific part of the bill as especially egregious.
“By imposing a 10-day timeline on signed petition forms, Florida politicians would effectively get rid of citizen-led amendments and eliminate a proven way for people to participate in the state’s democratic processes,” Ashwell said in a written statement.
“Point blank, this is an attack on our democracy and follows an undeniable pattern in Florida where state officials want to silence anyone who doesn’t agree with them and ensure people can’t decide for themselves how they’re governed.”

(Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The Maine Commission on Public Defense Services is asking the Legislature to consider a proposal to improve confidentiality between attorneys and incarcerated people communicating in jails. 
LD 1825, would prohibit a jail or third-party contractor who provides communication services from intercepting communication between a person who is incarcerated and an attorney or an employee of a law office. It would also bar them from charging a fee for those communications. 
Current law requires the commission to send a list of names and contact information for attorneys who provide legal services to incarcerated people to all sheriff’s offices on a weekly basis. The legislation would also require each jail to send electronic communications to each attorney on that list certifying that communications will not be intercepted or come with a fee. 
While the Department of Corrections already provides a certain amount of free phone calls to people being held in jails, officials opposed this bill, saying that allowing more would be cost prohibitive. Deputy Commissioner Anthony Cantillo also raised concerns about the electronic communication stipulation and whether jails would be able to keep track of who is an employee at a law office since only attorneys are included on that weekly list.
Maine is in the midst of what some have described a “constitutional crisis” regarding the state’s ability to provide timely counsel to defendants who can’t afford an attorney. The American Civil Liberties Union of Maine has argued since 2022 that the state is in violation of the Sixth Amendment, which declares the right to a speedy and public trial and legal counsel.
Earlier this year, the Kennebec County Superior Court agreed to start releasing defendants who have been waiting for counsel from incarceration if the state fails to provide representation. In response, the commission put forth a proposal with short- and long-term solutions to address the issue. 
LD 1825 was one of four bills the commission brought to the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee born out of an annual report that was submitted to the committee earlier this year. Because of this, they were not sponsored by individual legislators as usual. 
These proposals come after the Legislature passed a bill last month to bolster the state’s strained public defense system by creating new staff positions and increasing funding for private counsel representing defendants who can’t afford their own attorneys. It subsequently became law without Gov. Janet Mills endorsing it with her signature.
The commission also saw push back from the judicial branch on another proposal, LD 1796. 
That bill seeks to clarify that the courts — and not the commission — are responsible for providing and paying for counsel to a juvenile who files a petition for emancipation and those who are entitled to publicly funded counsel in probate cases. It similarly seeks to clarify that courts are responsible for providing the services of a guardian ad litem appointed at public expense.
Julie Finn, a representative for the judicial branch, said the proposed changes would transfer responsibilities onto the courts that are already underresourced. If the judicial branch is asked to take on those responsibilities and payments, Finn said additional dollars would need to follow. She gave a rough cost estimate of $350,000 to $400,000.
Carney asked Finn and the public defense commission’s Executive Director Jim Billings to ponder creative solutions to address the disagreement over who should have that responsibility because she thinks “the money, ultimately, will be a wash.”
Billings said he doesn’t have strong feelings on whether this falls on the commission or the judicial branch, but he wants to avoid future scenarios where the commission is paying for attorneys on both sides of a guardianship case. 
Another bill sought to clarify when a criminal defendant is entitled to counsel at state expense. Billings said the commission is asking the committee to consider LD 1802 because of previous situations that felt incongruent with due process and fairness. 
Currently, prosecutors indicate if they will be seeking jail time in cases where that would be possible. If they indicate they won’t be seeking jail time, that person does not have a right to indigent defense services. 
However, Billings said there are scenarios where a defendant has already spent a night in jail but the prosecutor isn’t planning to pursue further jail time, so they aren’t deemed eligible. LD 1802 would change the policy so that person would be entitled to counsel. 
Billings said other states actually use a simpler system that entitles a person to counsel if the crime they are charged with authorizes jail as a sentence, rather than relying on the intentions of the prosecutor. When asked why the commission isn’t trying to adopt that approach, Billings said he’s interested in using incremental change and compromise to further justice in the state.
“We are moving in baby steps over at PDS,” he told the committee. 
The final bill brought by the commission seeks technical amendments to the definitions of “employed counsel” and “public defender.” LD 1801 would also make training materials used by the commission confidential in response to concerns that some presenters have raised that their materials could be subject to Freedom of Access Act laws.

Tony Evers had already said he wasn’t directing state employees to break the law should immigration officials enter state buildings. Evers answers reporters questions in March. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers issued a three-minute video Friday in which he addressed Wisconsinites, describing a statement  from the White House border czar Tom Homan that has been interpreted by some as a threat to arrest Evers as “chilling.” 
Homan made the vague threat after a reporter for the far-right website Gateway Pundit asked him “why not just arrest” leaders interfering with deportation efforts. The reporter then specifically asked him about Evers’ directive to state agencies instructing them to consult an attorney if federal immigration agents enter state buildings demanding files or computer system access.
“Wait to see what’s coming,” Homan said. “You can not support what we’re doing and you can support sanctuary cities if that’s what you want to do, but if you cross that line of impediment or knowingly harboring or concealing an illegal alien, that is a felony and we’ll treat it as such.” 
Before the comment, Evers had already said he wasn’t directing state employees to break the law should immigration officials enter state buildings.
“A Trump Administration official, in not so many words, apparently threatened to arrest me… The goal of this guidance was simple — to provide clear, consistent instructions to state employees and ensure they have a lawyer to help them comply with all federal and state laws. Nothing more, nothing less,” Evers said in the video. “But Republicans and their right-wing allies, including Elon Musk, lied about this guidance, spread misinformation, accused me of doing things I didn’t do or say, and fueled a fake controversy of their own creation.”

The guidance sent by the Department of Administration to state employees told them to stay calm if an ICE agent entered their offices. It told them to ask agents for their names and badges to verify their identity, to ask why they were there, ask for documentation like a valid warrant then tell the agent to have a seat. It said state employees should call the Office of Legal Council to consult an attorney.
It also told employees not to answer questions from an agent, give them access to paper files and computer systems without speaking to an attorney and not to give consent for an agent to enter a “nonpublic” area, noting that they need a judicial warrant to enter such an area. 
“Remember that every state employee has a duty to protect confidential data and information collected or maintained by the State of Wisconsin in state offices and electronic filing systems,” the guidance stated. 
“I haven’t broken the law. I haven’t committed a crime, and I’ve never encouraged or directed anyone to break any laws or commit any crimes,” Evers said in the video. “When President Trump’s hand-picked appointee, Tom Homan, was asked about me and this guidance after he apparently threatened to arrest elected officials across the country, he said, ‘Wait ’til you see what’s coming.’ Overnight, Republican lawmakers piled on, encouraging the Trump Administration to arrest me.” 
Evers’ directive had received backlash from Wisconsin Republicans who called on Evers to rescind the guidance and support Trump’s deportation agenda. 
One Republican state lawmaker Rep. Calvin Callahan (R-Tomahawk) suggested in multiple social media posts Thursday that Evers should be arrested — sharing an AI-generated photo of Evers in handcuffs and writing in another post that “this is what Tony Evers sent out; stick him in the same cell as the Milwaukee judge!” Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested last week under accusations that she impeded the arrest of a man that ICE followed to her courtroom. 
Evers said the threats should concern everyone.
“In this country, the federal government doesn’t get to abuse its power to threaten everyday Americans. In this country, the federal government doesn’t get to arrest American citizens who have not committed a crime. In this country, we don’t threaten to persecute people just because they belong to a different political party,” Evers said. 
“These threats represent a concerning trajectory in this country. We now have a federal government that will threaten or arrest an elected official — or even everyday American citizens — who have broken no laws, committed no crimes, and done nothing wrong,” Evers said. “As disgusted as I am about the continued actions of the Trump Administration, I am not afraid. I have never once been discouraged from doing the right thing, and I will not start today.”

At least it wasn’t measles.
“Measles is the most contagious disease we have,” said Schmidtke, who teaches at Kansas City University.
But now, she and other public health experts are watching with alarm as the largely preventable virus marches toward Kansas City in the nation’s largest outbreak since 2019.
So far this year, health officials have confirmed 884 cases across the country, including 46 in southwest Kansas. One Missouri case reported on April 18 involved a child visiting the Branson area.
Marvia Jones, director of the Kansas City Health Department, said her agency will be as prepared as possible when cases reach the metro. But there’s little doubt about whether they will come.
“It’s clear to us that measles is just a car ride away from Kansas Citians,” Jones said at an April 29 press conference that was called to urge people to get vaccinated before the virus gets here.
But rising vaccine skepticism, falling immunization rates and recent major cuts to federal public health funding are all working against efforts to quickly end the current measles outbreak, health officials said.
“This makes me heartsick,” said Lynelle Phillips, president of the Missouri Immunization Coalition. “I think more children will be struck down and killed by a completely preventable outbreak of measles. And I think the question to us as Americans is how many of these children will have to die before we realize the mistake we’ve made?”
Three deaths have been attributed to the outbreak so far, including two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico.
 Declining immunization rates

Unlike the start of COVID when there was no vaccine, a highly effective measles vaccine is widely available. Until recently it was also widely adopted.
By 2000, 37 years after the measles vaccine was introduced, United States health officials could declare measles eliminated because there hadn’t been continuous spread for more than a year.
Now, that designation is in danger as measles cases spread. So far, the outbreak has reached 30 states. The largest cluster is in Texas, where 663 cases have been confirmed since late January.
The rise in measles infections, health leaders said, can be directly linked to low vaccination rates.
Herd immunity for measles, when the virus is unlikely to spread, requires a vaccination rate of 95%. But communities and schools are increasingly slipping below that mark. And where that happens, an outbreak becomes much more likely.
In Kansas City, three ZIP codes fall below the 95% threshold, city health officials said.

64114 in the Waldo area has an immunization rate of 93%.
64151, where Lake Waukomis is located north of the river, is at 92%.
And 64155, where the upscale Staley Farms development is located, has a vaccination rate of only 84%.

Jones said these undervaccinated ZIP codes will get special attention as the city works to convince more people to let their kids get vaccines. The health department plans to hold community meetings in these areas in hopes of answering questions and easing hesitancy.
“We are doing all we can to add outreach and have real conversations,” Jones said.
The health department also will extend the hours it offers vaccinations. Beginning May 14, vaccines will be available at 2400 Troost Ave. until 7 p.m., and Saturday hours will begin May 17. For an appointment, people can call 311, but appointments are not required.
 Growing vaccine skepticism

Parents, faced with an internet awash in inaccurate information about vaccinations in general and the measles vaccine specifically, are more often skipping routine childhood immunizations.
Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine are recommended for children. The first dose is recommended at about 1 year old, and a second dose when a child starts school, between 4 and 6 years old.
During the 2023-24 school year, immunization rates for kindergartners fell to 92.7% nationwide, from 95.2% during the 2019-20 school year. In Missouri, the rate went from 94.6% in 2019-20 to 90.4% in 2023-24. In those same years, Kansas’ rate climbed slightly, from 90% to 90.4%.
Six metro counties showed MMR vaccination rates below 95% for kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year.
Schools require children to have the MMR and other vaccinations in order to attend kindergarten, but states allow exemptions for religious or medical reasons. And those exemptions have been on the rise.
The Staley Farms ZIP code’s religious exemption rate doubled to 14% last year from 7% in 2019, city officials said. According to state records, private schools in Clay County, where the ZIP code is located, had a religious exemption rate of 13.4% in 2023, compared with 5.4% in 2019.
In Kansas, the statewide exemption rate was just over 1% in the 2010-11 school year. But by the 2023-24 year, it was up to almost 3%. And Missouri’s statewide rate is getting close to 5%, said Dr. George Turabelidze, Missouri’s state epidemiologist.
Phillips said the increase can also be traced to a change in Missouri law that took effect at the beginning of 2024, lowering barriers for parents to get vaccine exemptions for their children. It’s now as simple as filling out a form online and submitting it to the school.
“Prior to that, you would have to make an appointment at the health department and meet with a public health nurse,” Phillips said.
Parents who oppose vaccines objected to the state’s previous exemption requirements, saying they violated their speech and religious rights.
But Phillips said the added step of going to the health department gave parents an opportunity to learn about the health consequences of choosing to forgo their child’s vaccinations. And they also found out that children who are unvaccinated have to miss weeks of school if they are exposed — even if they don’t get sick.
Public health officials understand that a growing number of people are afraid of having their kids vaccinated. In part, they blame strong anti-vaccination views that took root during the COVID pandemic related to the vaccines developed to treat that virus.
“That (skepticism) spills over to other vaccines as well,” Turabelidze said.
In addition to fueling anti-vaccine views, the pandemic also led to more distrust of public health agencies, which became the face of shuttered schools and businesses and other restrictions that some people abhorred. That distrust has made it even harder to get accurate information to people who may be worried about unfounded claims about vaccines that flourish on the internet.
One of the most persistent myths — that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism — has been especially common, Turabelidze said.
“It’s been debunked so many times, I can’t even count,” he said. “But people keep repeating this myth.”
Now, many fear that the vaccine doubts have been given more credibility with the appointment of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services.
 Highly contagious

As Missouri’s immunization rates have slipped, Turabelidze said the state Department of Health and Senior Services has been working to increase outreach and education efforts, especially to schools or communities with lower vaccination rates.
Those communities are sitting ducks for such a highly contagious virus, health experts said.
Nine out of 10 unvaccinated people exposed to measles will get sick. And the virus can infect people who don’t even come into contact with someone who has it. Measles spreads when people talk, cough or sneeze, but can linger in the air for three hours.
“If I had a person in my class that had measles and didn’t know it and they left, everyone who enters that classroom for the next several hours could get it,” Phillips said. “It’s really difficult to manage transmission when you realize just how infectious measles is.”
And the measles virus can be dangerous. One in five people who get the virus end up in the hospital, Dr. Susanne Luedtke, an infectious disease specialist at University Health, told reporters during the April 29 press conference hosted by the Kansas City Health Department.
One in 20 children contract pneumonia with measles. The disease can cause brain swelling and serious long-term side effects like seizures, hearing loss and a condition called immune amnesia, which can destroy a child’s immune response. And between one and three of every 1,000 children who get measles will die.
“Measles is not a rash and a fever,” Luedtke said. “It’s a serious disease with real risks.”
Before the measles vaccine came along in 1963, almost everyone came down with measles before they turned 15. The telltale rash would begin at the hairline and move down the torso and out to the extremities. A high fever developed, along with symptoms like a runny nose and cough.
Of course, most people recovered as they would from the flu or another viral infection. But before the vaccine, every year an estimated 400 to 500 people died, 48,000 were hospitalized and 1,000 developed encephalitis or brain swelling.
“This is not a disease you joke around with,” Turabelidze said. “It’s highly contagious. And it can put you in the hospital. We already have three persons dead in this country. And you can also have long-term consequences.”
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services operates a 24-hour helpline that doctors can call if they run into a potential case of measles. Turabelidze said calls have increased as doctors, many of whom have never run into a case of measles before, grow increasingly wary of unidentifiable rashes.
“More often it’s not really measles,” he said. “But we would rather have a consultation” than an undetected case.
The state also has added capacity for the state laboratory to conduct PCR tests for measles. That service, which began in March, will reduce the time test results take, which could make a big difference in quelling an outbreak.
“We wanted to have a very, very quick response time because measles is so highly contagious,” Turabelidze said.
 Importance of education

When measles is detected, public health agencies play a crucial role in quickly locating anyone an infected person has been around. They also track down people who have shared an inside space where the infected person could have left behind the virus.
Public health is critical in managing an outbreak. But for the system to work, experts said, the public needs to trust public health. And public health agencies need to be available to answer questions to assuage concerns, provide information to doctors and patients and offer easy access to the vaccine.
“Vaccines in the refrigerator never yet prevented a single case of infection,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “They have to be administered… This takes human beings and it takes time.”
It also takes money. But recent federal funding cuts by the Trump administration have slashed support for public health outreach efforts.
On March 24, the Missouri Immunization Coalition, Phillips’ organization, lost all of its funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That money funded the group’s entire budget, which means it is now “on life support,” Phillips said.
And like other public health organizations that had relied on those funds, the work the coalition had been doing — educating people about vaccines, providing transportation and other resources to improve access — is hanging by a thread.
“Vaccination rates are not going to raise themselves,” Phillips said. “The organizations involved with all of the education and logistics and support … have been dismantled. At a time when we’re witnessing a resurgence in measles, these are the ingredients of a perfect storm.”
Missouri’s Department of Health and Senior Services lost a combined $255 million in the March 24 CDC cuts. That included $135 million in projects currently underway to support the state’s public health system and about $119 million for projects that hadn’t been determined.
Turabelidze said it is unclear how the cuts will affect the state’s vaccine efforts.
The Kansas City Health Department has seen federal cuts so far of about $3 million, money that was allocated to pay for adult vaccinations and outreach, enhanced laboratory capacity and community health workers.
On April 25, the city announced it had joined a coalition of other local governments and a labor union representing government workers in a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services funding cuts.
In a statement announcing the lawsuit, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas said, “It’s important that we as cities and people stand up for common sense and public health in the courts.”
It’s also worth remembering, Schmidtke said, that eliminating outreach programs may save money in the short term. But if measles cases increase as a result, the ultimate cost will be much more. While each MMR vaccine dose costs around $2, she said, managing a case of someone who contracts measles can cost $50,000.
“I know money isn’t everything,” Schmidtke said. “But when we don’t have enough money to get the outreach, to educate the public about the importance of vaccination, to educate them about where to find it, we run the risk of really expensive outbreaks that are hard to control.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.

But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
Fast-building states get more babies

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Apartment construction cools rents in some regions

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.

Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

(Photo courtesy USAO)Earlier this week, the United States Attorney’s Office in New Mexico announced that 82 people have already been hit with the novel misdemeanor charges for “unauthorized entry into the New Mexico National Defense Areas,” a crime punishable by up to one year in prison. 
That charge follows the United States Interior Department land transfer along New Mexico’s southern border to the U.S. Army, allowing federal troops to now detain and transfer individuals to federal law enforcement for criminal charges. Interior officials said the land transfer was intended to “safeguard sensitive natural and cultural resources,” and also crack down on illegal border crossings.
In touting the new measures, Defense Department officials have said the change simply amounts to converting the “Roosevelt Reservation,” which they describe in a news release as a 60-foot buffer zone along the borders Mexico shares with New Mexico, Arizona and California, into what is basically an extension of the U.S. Army Garrison Fort Huachaca in Cochise County, Arizona.

However, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office contended in an email Friday to Source New Mexico that the DoD description mischaracterizes the actual size of the area.
Heinrich spokesperson Caty Payette cited the Public Land Order that lists all the new parcels that are affected, along with a map showing a swath of southern New Mexico under the newly created “Emergency Withdrawal Area.” 
“It’s much further than just the 60-foot Roosevelt Reservation and has huge implications for anyone unwittingly driving along Highway 9 who might pull over to stretch their legs and unwittingly trespass on a military base,” Payette said in an email. 
According to a Source New Mexico analysis, the area in the “Emergency Withdrawal Area” is 406 square miles, an area more than twice the size of Albuquerque. 
“We think it’s an important technicality that speaks to the seismic impact of the administration’s action,” Payette said.

,DC,2025-05-02 18:24:48+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump budget puts clean-energy spending in crosshairs,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-budget-puts-clean-energy-spending-crosshairs,,"President Donald Trump’s budget request for the next fiscal year proposes deep cuts to renewable energy programs and other climate spending as the administration seeks to shift U.S. energy production to encourage more fossil fuels and push the focus away from reducing climate change.The budget proposes slashing $21 billion in unspent funds from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law for renewable energy, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and other efforts to cut climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions. The request also targets climate research spending and initiatives meant to promote diversity.“President Trump is committed to eliminating funding for the globalist climate agenda while unleashing American energy production,” a White House fact sheet on climate and environment spending said. The budget “eliminates funding for the Green New Scam.”The president’s budget request is a wish list for Congress, which controls federal spending, to consider. Even with both chambers of Congress controlled by Republicans who have shown an unusual willingness to follow Trump’s lead on a host of policies, it is best understood as a starting point for negotiations between the branches of government and a representation of the administration’s priorities.A White House official speaking on background Friday, though, said the Trump administration is exploring ways to exert more control over the federal spending process, including by potentially refusing to spend funds appropriated by lawmakers.The first budget request of Trump’s second term calls on Congress to cut non-defense accounts by $163 billion to $557 billion, while keeping defense funding flat at $893 billion.‘Political talking points’The proposal drew criticism for a focus on culture-war buzzwords, even from groups that are not always inclined to support environment and climate spending.The request “is long on rhetoric and short on details,” Steve Ellis, president of the nonpartisan budget watchdog Taxpayers for Common Sense, said in a statement.“This year’s version leans heavily on political talking points—taking aim at so-called ‘woke’ programs and the ‘Green New Scam,’ while proposing a massive Pentagon spending hike to pay for wasteful fantasies like the Golden Dome and diverting military resources to immigration enforcement missions.”Renewable energyThe administration proposal would roll back funding Trump’s predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, championed for renewable energy.It would cancel more than $15 billion from the 2021 infrastructure law “purposed for unreliable renewable energy, removing carbon dioxide from the air, and other costly technologies that burden ratepayers and consumers,” according to the White House fact sheet.It would also eliminate $6 billion for building electric vehicle charging infrastructure.“EV chargers should be built just like gas stations: with private sector resources disciplined by market forces,” the fact sheet said.And it would decrease spending on the Energy Department’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program, which helps private-sector projects secure financing and conducts research on low-carbon energy sources, by $2.5 billion.In a statement, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations subcommittee that writes the bill funding energy programs, slammed the cuts to renewable energy programs, saying they would cost consumers and hurt a growing domestic industry.""The Trump Administration’s proposal to slash $20 Billion from the Department of Energy’s programs — particularly a devastating 74% cut to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy — is shortsighted and dangerous,” the longtime Ohio lawmaker said. “By gutting clean energy investments, this budget threatens to raise energy prices for consumers, increase our reliance on foreign energy, and stifle American competitiveness. … We must defend the programs that power America's future — cleaner, cheaper, and made right here at home.”DiversityThroughout the request, the administration targets programs out of line with Trump’s ideology on social issues, including those meant to promote diversity.For energy and environment programs, that includes spending on environmental justice initiatives, which target pollution and climate effects in majority-minority and low-income communities, and organizations “that advance the radical climate agenda,” according to the fact sheet.Research and grant funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would be particularly hard hit by the proposal, which would terminate “a variety of climate-dominated research programs that are not aligned with Administration policy of ending ‘Green New Deal’ initiatives, saving taxpayers $1.3 billion.”The budget also proposes eliminating $100 million from a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fund dedicated to environmental justice. That funding “enabled a witch hunt against private industry” and “gave taxpayer dollars to political cronies who exploited the program’s racial preferencing policies to advance an anti-oil and gas crusade,” according to the White House.National Park Service targetedThe budget also proposes cutting $900 million from National Park Service operations, which the administration said would come from defunding smaller sites while “supporting many national treasures.”The document indicates the administration would prefer to leave responsibility for smaller sites currently under NPS management to states and refocus the federal government on the major parks that attract nationwide and international tourists.“There is an urgent need to streamline staffing and transfer certain properties to State-level management to ensure the long-term health and sustainment of the National Park system,” according to a budget spreadsheet highlighting major line items in the request.Despite laws in recent years to boost spending for maintenance at parks, the National Park Service faces a $23.3 billion deferred maintenance backlog, according to a July 2024 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.The proposed NPS cut represents the largest single funding change – either positive or negative – of any line item under the Department of Interior, which would receive a funding decrease of more than $5 billion, about 30%, under the proposal.Jennifer Shutt contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-02 15:12:12.501265

(Photo by Nikki Silva/Rhode Island Current)In his final months as Rhode Island Senate president, the late Dominick Ruggerio continued to rake in campaign donations, according to the first-quarter report filed with the Rhode Island Board of Elections Wednesday.
Ruggerio died on April 21. But his campaign finance account, and its $148,000 balance, lives on, with state law laying out a host of options for how the remains of his war chest can be spent. The balance — aside from any loans or debt that needs to be repaid — can be used to support other candidates, political parties and political action committees, donated to charity, or the money can be returned to the donor.
There’s no deadline by which a deceased officeholder or candidate’s campaign account must be closed, as long as there’s still a treasurer willing to administer the funds and file quarterly reports with the state elections board. 
Jim Aceto, Ruggerio’s brother-in-law, who was named as his campaign finance treasurer in 2008, said the family had not decided what to do with Ruggerio’s campaign funds.
“We’re not even thinking about that,” Aceto said in an interview Thursday.
Only one other campaign finance account remains open and active for a deceased officeholder or candidate, said Ric Thornton, the state elections board campaign finance director. 
Former Warwick Mayor Joe Solomon died in May 2021, but his son, Rep. Joe Solomon Jr., has maintained the account as its designated treasurer since his dad’s death. The older Solomon has over $67,000 cash on hand in his account, though no new donations have been made since his death. The campaign has spent money one time since May 2021, making a $500 donation in September 2024 to St. George Maronite Catholic Church in Cranston for a memorial, according to the report filed with the state elections board.
Solomon Jr., a Warwick Democrat first elected in 2014, did not return multiple calls for comment.
A third account for a deceased officeholder, former Cranston City Council President John E. Lanni Jr., remains open but inactive. After deducting bank fees, the remaining $1,200 balance was transferred to the state’s unclaimed property account, overseen by the Office of the General Treasurer, following Lanni’s death in 2020, Thornton said. Lois Lanni, John Lanni’s wife and the treasurer for his campaign account, died in 2019.
Prior to his death, Ruggerio missed most of the 2025 legislative session due to illness, including two stays at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in his North Providence district. But the 76-year-old Democrat, reelected to the Senate for the 40th time in November, nonetheless received a strong show of financial support from fellow officeholders, labor and business leaders.
Ruggerio reported nearly $93,000 in donations in the first three months of 2025, including $64,000 from individual donors and nearly $29,000 from political action committees. His financial supporters included local auto body shop owners, Bally’s Corp. lobbyists, and two of his predecessors: former Senate Presidents Billy Irons and Teresa Paiva-Weed, who donated $300 and $250, respectively. Gov. Dan McKee gave $1,000 to Ruggerio, while McKee’s 2022 Republican rival, Ashley Kalus, donated $150.
Ruggerio spent more than $65,400 from his campaign account in the first three months of the year, including more than $31,000 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Warwick on Feb. 5 for a political fundraiser. 
Ruggerio also contributed to many fellow lawmakers. He gave $1,000 to Sen. Val Lawson, the East Providence Democrat who was his majority leader, and elected Tuesday to succeed Ruggerio as president. Ruggerio also gave $500 to Sen. Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat tapped as the new majority leader. Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican who voted for herself in the leadership election among state senators Tuesday, received a $100 donation from Ruggerio’s campaign.

(Courtesy of City of Minneapolis)The number of measles cases is approaching 1,000 across 29 states, according to newly released federal statistics. Even as the outbreaks grow, more local governments are complaining that their efforts to combat measles with vaccination clinics have been shut down by abrupt federal funding cuts.
As of May 1, a total of 935 confirmed cases had been reported, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They were in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
There have been three confirmed deaths, two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.
Some measles response plans crash to a halt after Trump cuts

Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
The funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-02 18:13:45+00:00,CT Mirror,"Minority contractors say CT not following its own rules, proposed fix doesn’t go far enough",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/02/ct-minority-contractors-set-aside/,CT requires 25% of state contracts be set aside for small and minority-owned businesses. Study showed it's falling short.,"For decades, minority-owned businesses in Connecticut have struggled to win contracts to do work for the state — despite a nearly 50-year-old program requiring that a certain percentage of state contracting funds be awarded to businesses owned by people of color, women, veterans or people with disabilities.
In 2021, in response to concerns about underrepresentation of minority businesses and the alleged presence of “front businesses” taking advantage of the system, the legislature commissioned a study examining whether state contracts were being awarded fairly.
Last December, the results of that study were published — and they largely validated the concerns minority contractors have raised for years.
But business owners say lawmakers have thus far failed to take meaningful action in response to the findings. 
According to the report, conducted by consultancy Griffin & Strong, about 14% of all construction firms in Connecticut are owned by Black individuals. But between 2017 and 2021, these firms received only 0.57% of state contracts valued at less than $1 million. Of the $544 million spent on these contracts in total, $91 million went to firms owned by women and minorities — or roughly 17%.
The law requires that the state reserve, or “set aside,” 25% of its contracts for small businesses and minority-owned businesses.

Colin Dawkins, the president of the Greater Hartford African American Alliance and owner of MCM Acoustics in Hartford, said the study didn’t capture the full scale of the challenge minority contractors face, since it only examined school construction projects, without factoring in work at UConn and the state’s public colleges and universities — or any of the quasi-public state agencies. 
Aside from the state not meeting its mandate on contracts, minority subcontractors describe barriers across all aspects of the business: from seeking a line of credit from banks, to paying higher prices for materials and experiencing poor treatment by lead contractors on projects, including delayed payments.
“I just think that if it doesn’t get fixed now, we might have to wait until another 15 years for them to do another disparity study in order to fix what needs to be done,” said Dawkins. 
In the wake of the Griffin & Strong report, lawmakers drafted legislation this year that was intended to ease some of the barriers faced by business owners. 
The bill removes the 25% set-aside requirement, and instead assigns the state’s Commission of Human Rights and Opportunities to annually “establish goals for including small contractors and [minority business enterprises] on all public works contracts to attain parity with the availability of contractors required for the specific contract according to their industry and the relevant geographic area,” according to a nonpartisan analysis of the bill. CHRO would also be given a greater ability to penalize lead contractors who do not treat minority subcontractors fairly.
CHRO, which currently oversees the set-aside program and played a large role in drafting the legislation, said it’s meant to give the agency a greater ability to hold large contractors accountable for their treatment of minority subcontractors.
“This bill represents an important opportunity for Connecticut to address continuing disparities within state contracting while improving a program that aims to keep state contracting dollars within the state and giving all businesses, including small contractors and [minority and woman-owned business enterprises], an equal chance to compete for those dollars,” Tanya Hughes, executive director of the CHRO, wrote in testimony.
But owners of minority construction businesses who spoke with the Connecticut Mirror said the legislation won’t address the real barriers that keep small contractors like them locked out of state projects. 
“ It’s clear that the author and the architect [of the bill] have little understanding of the plight that minority businesses are facing contracting. They’re the ones who are supposed to know what we’re facing,” Bernard Thomas, the owner of Global Construction Services LLC and Vice President of the Minority Construction Council, said. “If not, ask. Don’t write up [a bill] and assume that … what you’re writing is good enough for the minority contractors.” 
Gwen Samuel, former owner of Samuel General Contracting, said it didn’t make sense for CHRO to continue to oversee the set-aside program when it was under that agency’s watch that the disparities found in the study were allowed to propagate. 
“ My concern with this whole [bill], it still doesn’t hold Connecticut accountable to fair practices,” Samuel said. 
An ‘aspirational’ program
In 1976, the state created a voluntary set-aside program for small businesses. A senator who spoke during a debate at the state Capitol at the time said the program was designed to keep a few large contractors from overtaking all the state contracts. The next year, the legislature made the program mandatory, and in 1982 it expanded the program to include mandatory set-asides for minority-owned businesses. 
Lawmakers in office at the time the minority-owned set-asides were created said they were intended to help minority businesses during a difficult economic period and create jobs in communities with high unemployment. At the time, a representative of the CHRO also noted that only a small number of minority-owned businesses were accessing state contracts. 
Subsequent changes to the law expanded the program to cover all state agencies and quasi-public agencies and increased the percentage of contracts that needed to be reserved for small and minority businesses. 
The current set-aside program requires that the state reserve 25% of its contracts for small businesses and minority-owned businesses. A quarter of that — 6.25% of contracts overall — must be granted to businesses owned by people of color, women, veterans or people with disabilities.  
In testimony to lawmakers in 2021, when the legislature was considering a disparity study, Hughes of CHRO pointed out that the last time the state studied the program was 1992. “The diversity and economy of Connecticut has changed substantially in almost 30 years,” she wrote, adding that a more “accurate picture” of the challenges facing minority contractors, “ensure equity and equality in state contracting by affirmatively addressing underutilization.”
Ultimately, last year’s Griffin & Strong disparity study characterized the program as “aspirational” rather than setting solid requirements for contracting, and it concluded that the state has failed to meet those goals in multiple categories of contracting for nearly every minority. 
A range of problems to solve
This year’s proposed law, which advanced out of the legislature’s Government Administration and Elections Committee in late March, incorporates a recommendation from the disparity study to shift from having overarching set-aside goals to having the CHRO decide on a project-by-project basis what percentage of the work should be reserved for minority businesses. 
Attorney Spencer Hill for the CHRO told CT Mirror that this was to ensure that what they were doing was legal, since the state constitution only allows race to be used narrowly as a criteria in government programs.
“You want to be very narrowly tailored and have a focused approach,  to ensure that you’re being as effective as possible and not being overly broad and relying on race in any way that’s inappropriate,” Hill said.
Still, contractors said there were other problems with the set-aside program that the legislation failed to address. 
For one, Colin Dawkins said, he believes the definition of “small” business is too large. Under federal guidelines, a masonry, framing, poured concrete or roofing contractor can make up to $19 million annually and still be considered a small business. 
Furthermore, the study referenced concerns from state staffers about “fronts” — situations where firms owned by men were registered in a woman’s name to make the business appear to be female-owned. According to the study, about one-third of business owners Griffin & Strong surveyed were under the impression that non-minority or woman-owned companies were misrepresenting themselves in order to circumvent certification requirements. 
Data from the disparity study shows that in construction, Black-owned businesses earned only 0.3% of the total amount of money the state paid out directly to contractors between 2017 and 2021. Non-minority woman-owned businesses earned 7.22% of the money during the same time period. 
Leigh Appleby, spokesperson for the state’s Department of Administrative Services — which administers state contracts — said in an email to CT Mirror that while the department has heard anecdotes about this for years, it “employs a rigorous review to prevent such things from happening.” He said DAS conducts random site visits, and that falsely placing a male-owned business under a woman’s name can be punished by fines or disqualification.
“DAS procurement has never disqualified a business based solely on a false representation of minority ownership,” Appleby said in a follow-up email. “In some cases, it has been determined that the certification as a small business is justified, while the certification as a minority-owned business is not.”
One woman quoted in the study, a construction firm owner, also said the state had begun to crack down on those “fronts” by interviewing companies to confirm ownership. 
Along with changing the set-aside program, CHRO attorney Hill said, the bill was also designed to increase the CHRO’s ability to oversee construction projects in real time and penalize contractors who do not follow through on efforts to engage minority businesses. 
Hill said the agency typically receives “a handful” of complaints each year from minority contractors. Most come from contractors who say they believed they were selected by a lead contractor to be part of a project solely in order to meet state requirements for minority contracting, and were later dropped from the project. 
“Small and minority contractors deserve the chance to compete in a level, fair marketplace.”Bernard Thomas, Global Construction Services LLC
He said that new reporting requirements outlined in the bill would allow the commission to catch any problems in the contracting process early on, rather than in a review period at the end of the project. 
Additionally, the commission would withhold 2% of the contract cost until their review was completed. 
But Bernard Thomas of Global Construction Services said in testimony to the legislature that the bill did not address inequities in the state’s contracting procedures “by any stretch of the imagination.” 
Thomas said he believed there was no way to hold towns or state agencies accountable when they fail to bid the project properly, and he said a $10,000 fine for violations of the law was “laughably low,” especially for out-of-state companies or contractors who only do business with the state on occasion. 
“Small and minority contractors deserve the chance to compete in a level, fair marketplace,” he wrote. 
Several state agencies also raised concerns about the bill’s intent to set project-by-project goals, saying they felt it would delay projects. 
Office of Policy and Management Secretary Jeff Beckham said the state needed better data collection in order to comply with the bill’s requirements, and DAS Commissioner Michelle Gilman questioned what would happen if available contractors did not bid on the contracts. Gilman also noted that requiring CHRO to set goals for each project without a clear timeline could stall projects. 
Hill said he believed that the new requirements would not cause the delays that the state agencies feared. “We hear their concerns about efficiency. We don’t want to be holding anything up. But I don’t think that the processes are as labor intensive as they’re kind of painting it as,” he said. 
Even if there are some delays, he said, making sure tax dollars are properly spent is critical.
“It would be very efficient to not have oversight and just give out tax dollars without anyone scrutinizing where they’re going or why. But as the state of Connecticut is saying, we need to be better than that,” Hill said. “If there is oversight that needs to happen, we’re not going to sacrifice that just for the sake of business expediency.”
‘Bigger, better breaks‘
Minority contractors say they operate within a system that favors larger, established firms over theirs. That disadvantage is present in every step of the process, from bidding to purchasing materials, they say.
Michele Clark Jenkins, Director of Research and Methodology for Griffin & Strong, told attendees at an informational session that more than half the firms they spoke with for the disparity study described an “informal network” that they said was “monopolizing public contracting with the state.” 
Clark Jenkins also made recommendations around CHRO’s accommodations of lead contractors’ “good faith efforts” — a concept that minority subcontractors have criticized. Under current policy, lead contractors who have made “good faith efforts” to reach out to minority businesses can be exempt from the set-aside requirements. But Clark Jenkins said their research showed that contracts were being awarded whether or not that “good faith effort” was made. 
CHRO Executive Director Hughes said in an email that the new bill would improve the agency’s ability to assess good faith efforts from the start of a project. 
In response to comments about an “informal” or “old boys” network, Appleby said DAS “follows all statutory guidelines concerning procurement,” limits how many contracts one business can have at a time, and has “worked to expand the breadth of our outreach when advertising to reach a wide swath of potential bidders.”
There are other roadblocks within state requirements, business owners told CT Mirror.
State rules require that contractors provide 10% of the total amount of the bid for any project over $50,000 up front. This is known as a “bid bond,” which acts as a kind of security deposit proving that the contractor will complete the project. 
Dawkins said many minority contractors aren’t able to access bid bonds at a level that would allow them to compete for multiple large contracts at once. They don’t have a large amount of assets, and any hits they take on credit can detract from their ability to get a bond. 
Both Dawkins and Rollo Jones, the owner of Capitol Masonry LLC in Hartford, said getting a bank or insurer to sign off on a bond was about relationships. Larger construction companies, they said, have established credit lines they can draw on. 
In addition, minority companies often pay more for materials like sheetrock and drywall. Larger firms are able to purchase in bulk, Dawkins said, meaning they often get a better per-unit price. 
“The big guys, they get bigger, better breaks. They get better deals, they get better contracts,” Rollo Jones told lawmakers. 
With higher material costs, minority business owners say they can’t always complete a project at a low price comparable to what larger firms can offer. 
Dawkins suggested the state could eliminate the requirement for bonding for minority contractors for any bids of $500,000 or less. This way, he said, smaller businesses that couldn’t afford a bid bond would have a chance at getting a contract. 
But Appleby said bonding protects taxpayer money if a contractor fails to complete their contract, and that it also protects workers and subcontractors if the contractor who hired them ends up unable to pay them for labor or materials. He said having a bond provides evidence that a contractor is financially stable.  
Another problem businesses cited was the sometimes lengthy periods they wait to get paid for their work. Although the state requires minority contractors to be paid within 25 days, about 45% of the contractors surveyed in Griffin & Strong’s disparity study said it took at least a month and a half to receive payments from the state. 
For about 10%, it took three months or longer. 
‘A domino effect’
Rollo Jones and his wife Rochelle say they’ve experienced many challenges with their business, Capitol Masonry, in the 30 years it’s been operating.
In one case, the company was contracting in Hartford for a project with the state Department of Transportation. Rochelle said they completed the job in September 2023 but didn’t receive their last check until December 2024. 
“I’ve never seen anyone who worked so hard to do a job and yet does not get paid on time,” Rochelle said of Rollo. “We have a contract we write up, [it’s] supposed to be recognized, but it’s never recognized.”
Department of Transportation Communications Director John Morgan told CT Mirror in an email that the department “has frequent communication and dialogue with Prime Contractors” about payments, and that the department is rolling out a new system that will monitor payments and give subcontractors more access to the department. 
Morgan said the primary contractors who receive payment directly from the department can delay payments to subcontractors “based on quality assurance and quality control of the work that was performed.” 
“If you don’t pay me on time, then I can’t pay my vendors, I can’t pay my taxes … It’s a domino effect.”Rollo Jones, Capitol Masonry LLC
But such delays can put small contractors in a tough position, particularly if they need to make payroll and they don’t have much in savings to draw on. It can also prevent them from taking on additional jobs, and it can hurt their credit. 
In October 2019, Rollo filed a complaint with CHRO against a lead contractor, Viking Construction, whom he alleged had refused to pay Jones the full amount for the work they did and treated him “unprofessionally overall.” 
CHRO ultimately ruled, in May 2022, that there was “reasonable cause” to believe that Jones had been discriminated against based on race. But Rochelle told CT Mirror that even with the CHRO finding, Capitol Masonry was paid only a fraction of the amount they were owed.
(Viking Construction attorney Jeffrey Mirman told CT Mirror in an email that Jones entered into a confidential agreement, withdrew his complaint from the CHRO and that Jones later signed a document in which it stated that he had been “paid in full.”) 
Rochelle said she felt the CHRO didn’t support them during hearings after the finding of probable cause, instead encouraging them to come to an agreement with Viking. In the midst of difficulties with her own lawyer, she said, she felt pressured to acquiesce. 
Hill declined to comment on specific cases, but said the CHRO does not represent any one party in proceedings.  
“If you don’t pay me on time, then I can’t pay my vendors, I can’t pay my taxes, you can’t pay your guys, it’s a domino effect,” Rollo Jones said. “That destroys you. You can’t go to a lender. You can’t go to a bank. You can’t get any material. You can’t get anything. It really destroys you.”
‘We should be embarrassed‘
Thomas, Dawkins and the Joneses asked members of the legislature to place woman-owned businesses in a separate category from ethnic minority-owned businesses, and they asked for the state to require subcontractors be paid on time. Dawkins also recommended eliminating bonding requirements for minority contractors taking on smaller contracts. 
Lawmakers who heard the contractors lay out the minefields they faced said they agreed the legislature needs to address the long-running problems. 
“That level of disparity is just a shame. And to be perfectly honest, I agree with you,” Rep. Joshua Hall, D-Hartford, told Jones at the hearing. “We should be embarrassed as representatives of our community that we’ve allowed this to transpire.” 
Earlier in the session, Hall proposed his own bill that would have eliminated the bonding requirement for all contracts of less than $1 million. The bill failed to receive a public hearing. 
“Our legislative people do not push on these issues,” Thomas told CT Mirror. Thomas said he felt the bill had been drafted “behind closed doors,” without necessary input from the contractors. 
CHRO Executive Director Hughes said in an email to CT Mirror that the agency had been in contact with the Minority Construction Council and had updated the council throughout the process about their plans to address what was laid out in the disparity study.
Jennifer Little-Greer, president of the Minority Construction Council, declined to comment for this article. 
Rep. Derell Wilson, D-Norwich, vice chair of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus, told CT Mirror that the bill was still being negotiated. He said while caucus members took the disparity study’s findings seriously, they’re still working to find the right way to help the minority contractors while staying within constitutional boundaries. 
“ We are all-in about this. I think that’s a no-brainer. I think for us [it’s] making sure we create something that’s, one, going to last [and] two, going to be beneficial and helpful. And we know that that’s not something that’s going to happen overnight,” Wilson told CT Mirror. 
Black and Puerto Rican Caucus Chair Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, confirmed to CT Mirror Thursday that negotiations were ongoing. He said they were discussing ways to ensure prompt payment to contractors and to verify that major contractors made “good faith efforts” to reach out to minority businesses.
Felipe said lawmakers likely wouldn’t be able to include everything the minority contractors requested, but he said he hoped they could fill some of their requests this year and build on that work next year. 
‘This is about fairness’
The contractors said that having minority business owners flourish does more than add diversity to an industry — it provides jobs in communities where people are in need of work. These contractors often train and employ residents of areas with high rates of poverty and unemployment. 
Gwen Samuel, the former co-owner of Samuel General Contracting, said she wants to restart the business this summer with a specific goal: training young people in construction. 
“They may not be skilled in engineering and plumbing,” she said. “But you can get a basic entry job and make a livable wage in construction.” 
At a public hearing, Samuel urged lawmakers to invest in minority companies, calling it a “fiscally sound decision.”

Dawkins used to run a program teaching incarcerated people at Cheshire Correctional Institute about construction and helping them get certified, before COVID shut it down. He also crafted a proposal years ago to train young people in construction and then have them fix up blighted houses. “ It’s been a passion of mine,” he said.
And the Joneses have been offering classes for decades to people coming out of prison who want to learn a trade. They offer six to eight week classes in things like concrete, carpentry and electrical work. They help them get an OSHA card and a driver’s license. 
Samuel said minority contractors aren’t looking for “help” — what they want is a system that they can operate in. 
“This is about fairness,” said Samuel. “We could help ourselves if we have fair access to the opportunity.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MINORITY-CONTRACTORS-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 15:12:12.501265

(Photo by Dan Koeck/North Dakota Monitor)A day for bringing attention to organized labor and worker rights extended into an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump’s agenda and expansion of executive power.
Around 600 demonstrators attended a May Day event in Fargo-Moorhead Thursday. Holding signs that addressed topics from demands for due process for deported immigrants to concerns about cuts to Social Security, they stood in the rain on the Veterans Memorial Bridge.
“This is one way we show our support of workers and the rule of law,” said Rick Loftus, organizer of the Indivisible Fargo chapter, also known as Fearless.
May Day is historically a time to acknowledge labor and worker rights, and this year’s event took on deeper meaning, Loftus said.
He noted that union membership has dropped to about 10% of all workers since the 1970s and this has led to reduced income and benefits for all employees. In addition, recent cuts to the federal workforce have brought additional attention to the importance of worker rights.
“We have a slogan: courage is contagious,” he said. “We gather because we want people to see we’re not afraid.”
Denise Lund-Smith traveled from Pelican Rapids, Minnesota, to participate in Thursday’s demonstration with her sister.
Lund-Smith has two granddaughters and says she wants to protect freedom for them. She held a sign with a bullet list of concerns ranging from the gutting of civil service employees to the slashing of federal programs.
“I’m 71 and this is the first time I’ve protested,” she said. “This isn’t about politics. (Trump and his administration) are destroying our democracy.”
Denise and Mark Magness of Fargo attended Thursday’s protest because they are frustrated by state Congressional leaders who won’t take a stand against what they describe as an expansion of executive power.
“(Our congressional leaders) are so chicken. They do nothing,” said Mark Magness, who said he calls his senators and representative regularly.
After about an hour, some of the demonstrators moved to the nearby Woodlawn Park where speakers addressed a crowd of about 150 people.
The program began with the singing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.
“And let’s put the emphasis on ‘liberty and justice for all’,” Loftus said.
Retired municipal judge Thomas Davies told the crowd they have power to demand changes.
“The U.S. was a beacon of hope and decency until Trump was elected,” he said. “We all have the ability to support candidates who make a positive difference in our national, state and local offices.”
Ashley Ladbury Hrichena spoke on behalf of the League of Women Voters of the Red River Valley. The national nonpartisan organization to which the local chapter belongs recently declared a constitutional crisis. State and local leagues are advocating for Congress to take action to protect the Constitution and advocating to maintain state and local voting rights, she said.
“From the flagrant disregard for constitutional authority and governmental checks and balances, to defying Supreme Court orders, to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back home, one thing is abundantly clear. Our country is in a constitutional crisis,” she said.
She then encouraged the crowd to continue to pressure their congressional representatives.
“Congress has been elected by you to serve us, not the president,” she said as the crowd broke into applause.
The event ended with comments from Laura Haugen Christensen, who represented the Northern Plains United Labor Council. Workers need to stand in solidarity, she said, because they’re all facing challenges and attacks: teachers, postal workers, factory workers, the unemployed and others.
“We’re united in our resolve to fight for a better future for all,” she said. “When working people stand together, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)While Iowa’s federal delegation has spent the week taking action on issues like fentanyl and Air Force facilities in Washington, D.C., some of Iowa’s U.S. representatives have also weighed in on an issue in their home state — the upcoming governor’s race.
After Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she would not seek reelection in 2026, several Republican elected officials in state and federal office have been brought up in media and elsewhere as potential candidates to replace her as the GOP nominee. Within state government, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, House Speaker Pat Grassley and state legislators including Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, have indicated they are considering a run for the seat, though none have officially announced their candidacy. Iowa Auditor Rob Sand is expected to join the race as the Democratic candidate but has also not announced an official run.
Iowa’s four U.S. representatives, all Republican, have also been mentioned. Three of the four have already said they do not plan to run for the position. On the WHO AM Simon Conway show Thursday, Rep. Zach Nunn, representing Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, said directly “no,” he will not run for governor.

“Governor’s race is open, I want to be very clear on this,” Nunn told Conway, a conservative talk show host. “… I think we all want to say thank you very much for Governor Reynolds, for her incredible service, for our state, for her leadership through COVID and beyond. Together, Governor Reynolds and I got to work on the three largest tax cuts in Iowa history, it’s better for every American. That said, we also have a mission. I am combat focused and trained, and now we are in Washington. I’ve got a job to do.”
Rep. Ashley Hinson also said she will not run for governor. She released a statement Tuesday saying she was thankful for the encouragement she has received from many Iowans asking her to run, but that she plans to stay in Washington to work with President Donald Trump on advancing a conservative agenda.
“We have a unique, once-in-a-generation opportunity to make real, lasting change in our country right now, and I’m committed to the fight to make Washington run more like Iowa,” Hinson said . “I am also committed to electing a conservative Governor in Iowa — I’ll be out on the campaign trail doing everything I can to help keep Iowa the best place in the world to call home.”
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks ruled out a run in a statement earlier in April, saying she was honored for the consideration, but “my current job is all encompassing and I will not be exploring a gubernatorial run.”
The only representative who said he was open to running for the position is Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa’s 4th Congressional District. According to the Des Moines Register, Feenstra was asked by reporters at an April Marshalltown event if he’s keeping his options open for a potential gubernatorial campaign, and he answered “I think that’s a fair statement.”
Outside of the 2026 gubernatorial race, here’s some of what members of Iowa’s D.C. delegation weighed in on this week:
Ernst presses Air Force nominee for Sioux City airfield improvements
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst called for the Air Force to make planned updates to Sioux City’s 185th Air Refueling Wing in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday.
The Iowa Republican brought up previous Air Force commitments to upgrade the Sioux City airfield during a hearing for Matthew Lohmeier, the nominee for the under-Secretary of Air Force position. Ernst said the Air Force said they would make these improvements for the 185th, a unit of the Iowa Air National Guard, when the refueling wing converted from F-16 fighters to KC-135 tankers in 2003.
Ernst said at the meeting because the tankers, a heavier aircraft that are carrying fuel for delivery, weigh significantly more than the previous fighters, the current Sioux City runway is unable to support these planes. She said further aircraft upgrades now underway in the Air Force further threaten the 185th, saying the squadron “could potentially lose its mission because of the failure to upgrade this runway.”
“This is completely unacceptable, and the Air Force must live up to its commitment as of 22 years ago,” Ernst said Thursday.
Lohmeier did not agree directly that the Air Force will go through with the upgrades to the Sioux City facility when pressed by Ernst, but said he would be “very transparent in my communications” on the issue and investigate further if confirmed.
“I make the same commitment to you that I’ve made to Sen. (Tom) Cotton, or that I’d be willing to make with any senator in this room, that I’ll weigh each matter in a nonpolitical manner, try and make the best decisions for the force,” Lohmeier said. “And of course, I’m very interested, Senator, as you suggested, in honoring the commitments that the Department of the Air Force has made in the past where that’s feasible.”
Ernst said she will continue to press Air Force leadership to follow through with the Sioux City facility improvements.
“Iowa’s 185th has served with honor, and they absolutely deserve infrastructure that matches their operational demands,” Ernst said. “I’m going to continue to press on this, and I hope that I have resolution in the near future. We need to make sure these commitments are honored.”
Nunn, Ernst propose fentanyl legislation
Ernst also introduced a bill this week to raise criminal penalties for distributing fentanyl when the drug results in the user’s death.
The “Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act,” introduced by Ernst in the Senate and Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, in the House, would make the act of knowingly distributing fentanyl a first-degree murder charge when the fentanyl use caused a person’s death.
Ernst said in a statement Tuesday the measure will help prevent deaths from fentanyl.
“I have seen firsthand how the scourge of fentanyl has inflicted incredible tragedy on communities across Iowa,” Ernst said. “I have worked for years to protect Americans and stop this deadly epidemic. Increasing the severity of the punishment for the drug dealers responsible for the deaths of too many Iowans is long overdue.”
In 2024, the Iowa House passed a similar increase in criminal penalties for people who distribute fentanyl that results in death, but did not include the language in Ernst’s legislation that the distributor must be “knowingly” sharing the drug. The Iowa House passed a similar measure again this year, but it has not been taken up by the Senate.
In recent years, Iowa has seen an increase in overdose deaths related to fentanyl. Republicans at both the state and federal level have called for further action to secure the U.S.-Mexico southern border and prevent drug trafficking of fentanyl into the country. A 2020 U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration report found most fentanyl is transported into the U.S. through legal ports of entry by U.S. citizens.
Nunn introduced a bill Tuesday alongside Rep. Josh Riley, D-New York, aimed at developing technology to detect fentanyl at the border and other government facilities.
The “Stop Fentanyl Smuggling Act” would direct the National Laboratories at the U.S. Department of Energy to research and develop new technologies that can detect fentanyl vapor and particles, particularly for use at U.S. border entry points and in prisons.
In a news release, Nunn said the measure will equip law enforcement with better tools for combatting fentanyl trafficking and will help prevent deaths caused by the drug.
“Fentanyl and synthetic opioids were responsible for 43% of all drug overdoses in Iowa in 2022,” Nunn said in a statement. “Every life lost to this poison is a family shattered. … I’m proud to lead bipartisan legislation that empowers our border agents, first responders, and law enforcement with the tools they need to detect fentanyl before it reaches our streets. This is about saving lives and protecting Iowa communities.”

Details of the decision will be rolled out at a downtown Boston meeting later this month.
The post The next MBTA commuter rail contract is likely to look similar to the current one  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MBTA OFFICIALS have been weighing how to approach the next contract for the operations and maintenance of the commuter rail while also modernizing the system, which serves 550,000 passengers every week. They plan to roll out the details of their decision to companies potentially interested in bidding on the contract at a meeting inside the state transportation building in downtown Boston later this month. When the MBTA asked for industry feedback last year, most companies said they wanted the opportunity to bid on multiple contracts, including breaking out operations and maintenance separately.  But the scope of the new contract is going to look familiar, because it’s expected to be similar to the current one, according to transportation officials: Operations and maintenance will be handled by one company, as it is right now by Keolis Commuter Services, which has had a contract since 2014. The Keolis contract, a $4 billion agreement that saw several extensions, is now set to expire in June 2027. A request for proposals is slated to go out this fall, with plans for a new contract awarded by the end of 2026 or beginning of 2027, leaving a tight timeframe to transition to the new contract if Keolis is not the operator. The contract for the modernization of the commuter rail will be handled separately, state transportation officials told CommonWealth Beacon. In discussing modernization of the system, MBTA officials have talked of swapping diesel-powered locomotives for electric ones and offering more frequent trips. Those discussions are expected to continue as the MBTA focuses on locking down a contract for operating and maintaining the current system. “I think they’ve done a lot of research and hard work to put this forward, to make sure we get what’s best for the T, but just as important best for the commonwealth, in terms of the next contract,” said Thomas McGee, chair of the MBTA’s board of directors. A public notice on the T’s website touts an “Industry Day” on May 13. “The event is intended for businesses and suppliers in passenger rail operations, rolling stock [locomotives and passenger car] maintenance, and existing infrastructure maintenance,” the notice says. In the days following the event, the MBTA is also offering confidential one-on-one meetings to organizations interested in responding to the procurement process. “Conducting a robust and highly competitive bidding process is paramount to ensuring the delivery of reliable, safe and accessible Commuter Rail service for many years to come,” MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo said in a statement. Brian Kane, the head of the MBTA Advisory Board, a watchdog of the public transit agency, said the MBTA’s decision to stick with a scope similar to the current set-up raises questions. “Like many people I still have a lot of questions, mostly around the contract’s duration. Are they going to give someone, not necessarily Keolis, but someone, a ten-year deal, a 20-year deal? And does that set the timeline for when regional rail [modernization] is meant to begin? And how is that transition going to be managed? Because transitions are where it gets tricky,” he said. “There are just more questions than answers right now.” Kane also voiced a concern that the T’s approach could be viewed as giving Keolis, the current operator, a “big advantage.” The perception of an advantage could drive away other contract bidders, he said. “I don’t want that perception because this is too important.” Kane added that the MBTA should more seriously analyze bringing everything in-house, similar to the structure that Phil Eng, the MBTA’s general manager, oversaw in New York when headed up the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). Rich Davey, who worked for MBCR, the company that held the commuter rail contract before Keolis and later left to become MBTA general manager and then state transportation secretary, said he didn’t have a strong opinion on how the contract should be structured, but emphasized that whatever scenario emerges, it should be a competitive bidding process.  “I don’t think people realize – whatever the contract length, 10 years, 20 years, 70 years – it’s expensive,” said Davey, who now heads up the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), which owns and operates Logan International Airport. “And commuter rail contractors do not grow on trees, globally. I’ve been involved in this, in and out for the last 20 years. It’s usually two or three competitors at best.” The post The next MBTA commuter rail contract is likely to look similar to the current one  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CommuterRailtressle.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 14:12:29.957091

The Kentucky Department of Education has requested a funding extension for projects in 13 public school districts that are in jeopardy if the federal government continues to halt future payments of pandemic relief funds.
In a Friday press release, Kentucky Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher said KDE hopes the U.S. Department of Education approves a deadline extension to use COVID-19 relief funds but the school districts “should not have to go through this extra step and the uncertainty because these projects had already been approved by USED.” 
The projects across the 13 school districts were to receive more than $35.5 million in promised funding from the federal government. The school districts had previously requested the expected money from the U.S. Department of Education. Some had signed contracts or incurred other obligations and must now re-examine their district budgets. 
Fletcher previously urged school superintendents to contact their lawmakers in Congress about the sudden stoppage of COVID-19 relief funds to Kentucky schools. School districts previously had until March of 2026 to spend COVID-19 relief funds that had been approved. However, in a  March 28 letter, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon told state education departments that the federal government was immediately halting nearly $3 billion in relief fund reimbursements. 
McMahon’s letter said the federal department would consider extending the pandemic relief funds’ liquidation period on an individual project basis. KDE submitted information about the planned projects in a deadline extension request to USED. 
“Compounding the problem is that in order to get the extension to spend this money from USED, school districts and KDE have signed contracts that obligated how the money would be spent,” Fletcher said. “Those contracts still exist, and some hard decisions have to be  made about how to pay for these projects if USED does not honor its previous commitments.”
The school districts identified by KDE in the extension request are Boone County, Carter County, Caverna Independent, Christian County, Clinton County, Covington Independent, Knox County, Laurel County, Letcher County, Owsley County, Perry County, Pike County and Trigg County. The districts planned to use their remaining pandemic relief funds for various projects, such as construction of school buildings and ordering new buses. 
Letcher County Schools planned to use its remaining more than $3 million in pandemic relief funds to buy 25 school buses to replace ones lost during the July 2022 floods in Eastern Kentucky. The district’s superintendent, Denise Yonts, said the district must pay for the buses regardless of what the federal education department decides, according to KDE’s press release.
“The board will have to go back to the drawing board on the budget,” Yonts said in the statement. “Right now, we have to look at the contingency and what other resources we have.”
In addition to the school districts’ projects, KDE had $18 million in unspent pandemic relief funds that were initially approved to be used through March 2026. KDE planned to use the money for initiatives like expanding the amount of students for the Kentucky Governor’s School for the Arts program this summer, supporting summer learning for students in 13 school districts and enhancing career and technical education for students with disabilities in four school districts.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/school-choice.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 14:12:29.957091

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)State airport officials Friday withdrew a petition filed a week ago to join the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Screening Partnership Program, a move that could have shifted passenger screening at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport to a private contractor.
The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) said the decision was made after observing “significantly enhanced performance at the checkpoint” in recent weeks.
Airport officials filed the application on April 25 at the recommendation of Virginia-based consultant Studdiford Technical Solutions after RIAC raised concerns about long checkpoint lines during early morning travel last October.
Airport officials consider privatizing TSA screening duties at T.F. Green

Airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said the TSA has since worked to improve wait times at each of the seven lanes within the federal checkpoint.
“Improved wait times, particularly in recent days, have alleviated concerns raised by the airlines and the passengers back in the fall of 2024,” Fischer said in a statement. “RIAC was pleased to witness that the early morning lines that spilled out of the terminal in November are now mostly contained inside the checkpoint — a marked improvement.”
 TSA spokesperson Daniel Velez said the federal agency tries to reduce wait times by adjusting staffing levels during peak hours and high-travel seasons, along with opening additional lanes or redirecting passengers to less congested checkpoints.
Velez declined to comment on RIAC’s decision to drop its petition.
The longest wait time in the last month was at 27 minutes, according to TSA data obtained by Rhode Island Current. The average maximum wait travelers experienced in April was 10 minutes. 
Fischer said airport officials will continue to track wait times, noting an inspection conducted between 4 and 6 a.m. Friday saw roughly 400 travelers go through the checkpoint without any backups.
“RIAC has been singularly focused on one objective: reasonable wait times at PVD’s checkpoint,” he said. 
RIAC’s initial consideration to privatize TSA duties drew quick opposition from union leaders and Rhode Island’s congressional delegation. 
“Success,” responded the head of the union representing New England’s TSA officers after being told RIAC had rescinded its petition.
“Their initial decision to go private was ill-advised,” Mike Gayzagian, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2617 headquartered in Boston, said in an interview.
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said RIAC made the right move in leaving screening duties with the TSA.
“Putting people and the traveling public first must be job one at any top-notch airport,” he said in a statement. “ I know the people who work at TSA are committed to being efficient, effective, courteous, and professional and will continue to serve at these high standards.”

About 300 union members cheered the announcement made by Bill Louis, president of the Marine Draftsmen’s Association-United Auto Workers of America, Local 571, The Day of New London newspaper reported.
“We’re officially putting the company on notice that if we don’t have an agreement at 11:59 p.m., we strike at midnight May 18,” Louis told the union members, most of whom are essentially responsible for designing the U.S. Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet.
A message was left seeking comment with an EB spokesperson in Groton.
The looming strike comes a day after the U.S. Navy awarded EB’s parent company, General Dynamics, a contract worth more than $12.4 billion for the construction of two Virginia class submarines authorized during last fiscal year. The funding also covers improved worker pay.
More than two-thirds of the union membership voted last month to authorize a strike if a deal couldn’t be reached on a new contract.
The union’s contract expired on April 4, but leadership has agreed to continue bargaining with EB. They’ve demanded higher wages over four years, the restoration of pension benefits for all members, cost of living adjustments and profit sharing with General Dynamics, EB’s parent company, among other changes.
“The clock has run out on corporate greed,” UAW President Shawn Fain told members during a rally last month. “And I’ll tell you, this is a new UAW where the membership comes first, and we refuse to aim low and settle lower.”
EB’s earlier now-expired offer had included a 23.3% general wage increase over the life of the contract, plus benefits and an increased retirement package.
The company has acknowledged it has been “actively preparing a business continuity plan in the event of a work stoppage,” adding it will “not waver from our commitment to continue building submarines, the nation’s top national security priority.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25122010963029-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-02 16:11:38.370437

Credit: U.S. Food and Drug Administration.A push to require doctors to treat unvaccinated patients fell short on the final day of  the Florida Legislature’s regular session but lawmakers did agree to pass a priority healthcare package for Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The House on Friday voted unanimously for final approval of HB 1299.
The bill extends the legal definition of mRNA vaccines and continues a ban on businesses, government entities, and education institutions from denying entry or service based on vaccination status. Mask requirements are also banned under the law, which DeSantis persuaded the Legislature to approve in 2021.
But legislators stripped a mandate from the bill that physicians treat patients regardless of vaccination status after Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell, Democratic Sen. Lori Berman, and independent Sen. Jason Pizzo expressed discomfort with the requirement. Harrell, whose late husband was a physician, warned that the requirement would open doctors to increased liability.
Pizzo said the mandate would have contradicted a law that guarantees Florida physicians legal protections to not treat patients on the basis of their conscience.
HB 1299 also tweaks a 2024 law that banned the Board of Medicine from licensing by “endorsement” physicians who have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, which includes information on medical malpractice settlements. 
HB 1299 makes clear that the Board of Medicine (BOM) can approve licenses by endorsement based on data bank files as long as the reported incident didn’t violate any state law or rule.
Licensure by endorsement is the route to practice in Florida for  doctors initially licensed in other states.
The Board of Medicine opposed the changes in the 2024 law and even contemplated asking the governor to veto the bill. Sen. Jay Collins, sponsor of the Senate companion bill, said he worked with the board to iron out the language.

(Photos by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)A day for bringing attention to organized labor and worker rights extended into an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump’s agenda and expansion of executive power.
Around 600 demonstrators attended a May Day event in Fargo-Moorhead Thursday. Holding signs that addressed topics from demands for due process for deported immigrants to concerns about cuts to Social Security, they stood in the rain on the Veterans Memorial Bridge.
“This is one way we show our support of workers and the rule of law,” said Rick Loftus, organizer of the Indivisible Fargo chapter, also known as Fearless.

May Day is historically a time to acknowledge labor and worker rights, and this year’s event took on deeper meaning, Loftus said. 
He noted that union membership has dropped to about 10% of all workers since the 1970s and this has led to reduced income and benefits for all employees. In addition, recent cuts to the federal workforce have brought additional attention to the importance of worker rights.
“We have a slogan: courage is contagious,” he said. “We gather because we want people to see we’re not afraid.”
Denise Lund-Smith traveled from Pelican Rapids, Minnesota, to participate in Thursday’s demonstration with her sister.
Lund-Smith has two granddaughters and says she wants to protect freedom for them. She held a sign with a bullet list of concerns ranging from the gutting of civil service employees to the slashing of federal programs.  
“I’m 71 and this is the first time I’ve protested,” she said. “This isn’t about politics. (Trump and his administration) are destroying our democracy.”
Denise and Mark Magness of Fargo attended Thursday’s protest because they are frustrated by state Congressional leaders who won’t take a stand against what they describe as an expansion of executive power.
“(Our congressional leaders) are so chicken. They do nothing,” said Mark Magness, who said he calls his senators and representative regularly.













































After about an hour, some of the demonstrators moved to the nearby Woodlawn Park where speakers addressed a crowd of about 150 people.
The program began with the singing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.
“And let’s put the emphasis on ‘liberty and justice for all’,” Loftus said.

Retired municipal judge Thomas Davies told the crowd they have power to demand changes.
“The U.S. was a beacon of hope and decency until Trump was elected,” he said. “We all have the ability to support candidates who make a positive difference in our national, state and local offices.”
Ashley Ladbury Hrichena spoke on behalf of the League of Women Voters of the Red River Valley. The national nonpartisan organization to which the local chapter belongs recently declared a constitutional crisis. State and local leagues are advocating for Congress to take action to protect the Constitution and advocating to maintain state and local voting rights, she said.
“From the flagrant disregard for constitutional authority and governmental checks and balances, to defying Supreme Court orders, to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back home, one thing is abundantly clear. Our country is in a constitutional crisis,” she said. 
She then encouraged the crowd to continue to pressure their congressional representatives.
“Congress has been elected by you to serve us, not the president,” she said as the crowd broke into applause.

The event ended with comments from Laura Haugen Christensen, who represented the Northern Plains United Labor Council. Workers need to stand in solidarity, she said, because they’re all facing challenges and attacks: teachers, postal workers, factory workers, the unemployed and others. 
“We’re united in our resolve to fight for a better future for all,” she said. “When working people stand together, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish.”

“Measles is a highly contagious disease, as we can see by its spread around the country,” New Mexico Department of Health Acting State Epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser said in a statement. “More people traveling in the summer emphasizes the importance of keeping you and your loved ones safe with the best-known protection – the MMR vaccine.”
The United States currently has 935 cases of measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with reports of infections in 30 of the 50 states as of Friday.
NMDOH also reported an additional adult measles infection in Doña Ana County, bringing New Mexico’s total to 67 cases since the outbreak began in mid-February.
The vast majority of cases, 61, have been recorded in Lea County, which neighbors the outbreak’s epicenter in Gaines County, Texas. The remaining cases lie in the state’s southern portion: three in Eddy County, two in Doña Ana County and one in Chaves County.
NMDOH Scientific laboratory tested 141 samples for measles since Feb. 1, agency spokesperson David Morgan told Source NM on Friday. Doctors have the option to use private laboratories to test samples, but any positive results must be reported to the state, Morgan told Source via email.
More New Mexicans continue to seek the MMR vaccine, with 20,304 vaccinations administered between Feb. 1 and April 26, double the 10,860 given in the same time period last year.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. Symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and a spotty red rash. Symptoms can develop one to three weeks after an exposure, and people are contagious days before and after symptoms appear. An estimated one in five cases is serious enough to require hospitalization with severe complications such as brain swelling, blindness or death.
NMODH urges anyone with symptoms or possible exposure to call the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-796-8773 for guidance in English and Spanish about measles testing or vaccinations.
Health officials are operating 10 vaccination clinics in the state’s southern region, open daily, which require no appointment. There additionally, are other vaccine clinics around the state, which are listed on the state’s website here.

The Louisiana Department of Health identified 164 cases of pertussis, known commonly as whooping cough, in the first four months of 2025. The numbers are on track to break record highs. In comparison, the state had a total of 153 cases last year.
The significant spread of whooping cough is causing increased hospitalizations and deaths. Since September, 40 people in Louisiana have been hospitalized with the illness, and 70% of those hospitalizations involve children younger than 1. 
Two of those infants have died, marking the first two whooping cough deaths in Louisiana since 2018, according to LDH.
Belief in false measles claims correlates with lower vaccination rates, poll finds

Whooping cough is a naturally occurring disease in the U.S.. It is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. People with pertussis commonly have severe coughing fits, causing them to take deep breaths that make a “whooping” sound.
The disease spreads from person to person through coughing, sneezing and close contact. Infected people can spread the bacteria from the start of symptoms up to three weeks after coughing begins.
Infants are most affected by whooping cough, showing the highest reported rates of infection and the greatest likelihood of severe complications and death. Bacteria that cause whooping cough are often unknowingly spread to infants by close family or caregivers.
Health authorities say the best way to avoid illness from whooping cough is through vaccination. The vaccines are effective, but protection fades over time, the health department said. Infants over 2 months of age can receive the pertussis vaccine, and mothers can receive it during pregnancy to protect their newborns.

,DC,2025-05-02 17:33:36+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump asks Congress to cut $163B in non-defense spending, ax dozens of programs","Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-asks-congress-cut-163b-non-defense-spending-ax-dozens-programs,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump released a budget request Friday that would dramatically slash some federal spending, the initial step in a monthslong process that will include heated debate on Capitol Hill as both political parties work toward a final government funding agreement.The proposal, for the first time, details how exactly this administration wants lawmakers to restructure spending across the federal government — steep cuts to domestic appropriations, including the elimination of dozens of programs that carry a long history of bipartisan support, and a significant increase in defense funding.Trump wants more than 60 programs to be scrapped, some with long histories of assistance to states, including Community Services Block Grants, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Institute on Minority and Health Disparities within the National Institutes of Health, and the Sexual Risk Avoidance and Teen Pregnancy Prevention programs.Congress will ultimately decide how much funding to provide to federal programs, and while Republicans hold majorities in both chambers, regular funding bills will need Democratic support to move through the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.White House budget director Russ Vought wrote in a letter that the request proposes shifting some funding from the federal government to states and local communities.“Just as the Federal Government has intruded on matters best left to American families, it has intruded on matters best left to the levels of government closest to the people, who understand and respect the needs and desires of their communities far better than the Federal Government ever could,” Vought wrote.The budget request calls on Congress to cut non-defense accounts by $163 billion to $557 billion, while keeping defense funding flat at $893 billion in the dozen annual appropriations bills.The proposal assumes the GOP Congress passes the separate reconciliation package that is currently being written in the House, bringing defense funding up to $1.01 trillion, a 13.4% increase, and reducing domestic spending to $601 billion, a 16.6% decrease.Many domestic cutsUnder Trump’s request many federal departments and agencies would be slated for significant spending reductions, though defense, border security and veterans would be exempt. The cuts include:Agriculture: - $5 billion, or 18.3%Commerce: - $1.7 billion, or 16.5%Education: - $12 billion, or 15.3%Energy: - $4.7 billion, or 9.4%Health and Human Services: - $33 billion, or 26.2%Housing and Urban Development: - $33.6 billion, or 43.6%Interior: - $5.1 billion, or 30.5%Justice: - $2.7 billion, or 7.6%Labor: - $4.6 billion, or 34.9%State: - $49.1 billion, or 83.7%Treasury: - $2.7 billion, or 19%Increases include:Defense: + $113 billion, or 13.4% with reconciliation packageHomeland Security: + $42.3 billion, or 64.9% with reconciliation packageTransportation: + $1.5 billion, or 5.8%Veterans Affairs: + $5.4 billion, or 4.1%The budget request also asks Congress to eliminate AmeriCorps, which operates as the Corporation for National and Community Service; the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides some funding to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service; the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences; and the 400 Years of African American History Commission.What if Congress won’t act on the cuts?Debate over the budget proposal will take place throughout the summer months, but will come to a head in September, when Congress must pass some sort of funding bill to avoid a partial government shutdown.A senior White House official, speaking on background on a call with reporters to discuss details of the budget request, suggested that Trump would take unilateral action to cut funding if Congress doesn’t go along with the request.“Obviously, we have never taken impoundment off the table, because the president and myself believe that 200 years of the president and executive branch had that ability,” the official said. “But we're working with Congress to see what they will pass. And I believe that they have an interest in passing cuts.”The 1974 Impoundment Control Act bars the president from canceling funding approved by Congress without consulting lawmakers via a rescissions request, which the officials said the administration plans to release “soon.”The annual appropriations process is separate from the reconciliation process that Republicans are using to pass their massive tax cuts, border security, defense funding and spending cuts package.Huge boost for Homeland SecurityThe budget proposal aligns with the Trump’s administration's plans for mass deportations of people without permanent legal status, and would provide the Department of Homeland Security with $42.3 billion, or a 64.9% increase.The budget proposal suggests eliminating $650 million from a program that reimburses non-governmental organizations and local governments that help with resettling and aiding newly arrived migrants released from DHS custody, known as the Shelters and Services Program.The Trump administration also seeks to eliminate the agency that handles the care and resettlement of unaccompanied minors within Health and Human Services. The budget proposal recommends getting rid of the Refugee and Unaccompanied Alien Children Programs’ $1.97 billion budget. The budget proposal argues that because of an executive order to suspend refugee resettlement services, there is no need for the programs.A federal judge from Washington state issued a nationwide injunction, and ruled the Trump administration must continue refugee resettlement services.The budget proposal also calls for axing programs that help newly arrived migrant children or students for whom English is not a first language.For the Education Department, the budget proposal suggests eliminating $890 million in funding for the English Language Acquisition and $428 million for the Migrant Education and Special Programs for Migrant Students.Key GOP senator rejects defense requestMembers of Congress had mixed reactions to the budget request, with some GOP lawmakers praising its spending cuts, while others took issue with the defense budget.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., outright rejected the defense funding level, writing in a statement that relying on the reconciliation package to get military spending above $1 trillion was unacceptable. “OMB is not requesting a trillion-dollar budget. It is requesting a budget of $892.6 billion, which is a cut in real terms. This budget would decrease President Trump’s military options and his negotiating leverage,” Wicker wrote. “We face an Axis of Aggressors led by the Chinese Communist Party, who have already started a trade war rather than negotiate in good faith. We need a real Peace Through Strength agenda to ensure Xi Jinping does not launch a military war against us in Asia, beyond his existing military support to the Russians, the Iranians, Hamas, and the Houthis.”The senior White House official who spoke on a call with reporters to discuss details of the budget request said that splitting the defense increase between the regular Pentagon spending bill and the reconciliation package was a more “durable” proposal.Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, wrote the panel will have “an aggressive hearing schedule to learn more about the President’s proposal and assess funding needs for the coming year.”“This request has come to Congress late, and key details still remain outstanding,” Collins wrote. “Based on my initial review, however, I have serious objections to the proposed freeze in our defense funding given the security challenges we face and to the proposed funding cuts to – and in some cases elimination of – programs like LIHEAP, TRIO, and those that support biomedical research. “Ultimately, it is Congress that holds the power of the purse.”Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement she will work with others in Congress to block the domestic funding cuts from taking effect.“Trump wants to rip away funding to safeguard Americans’ health, protect our environment, and to help rural communities and our farmers thrive. This president wants to turn our country’s back on Tribes—and let trash pile up at our national parks,” Murray wrote. “Trump is even proposing to cut investments to prevent violent crime, go after drug traffickers, and tackle the opioids and mental health crises.”A press release from Murray’s office noted the budget request lacked details on certain programs, including Head Start.House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La, praised the budget proposal in a statement and pledged that House GOP lawmakers are “ready to work alongside President Trump to implement a responsible budget that puts America first.”“President Trump’s plan ensures every federal taxpayer dollar spent is used to serve the American people, not a bloated bureaucracy or partisan pet projects,” Johnson wrote.Spending decisions comingThe House and Senate Appropriations committees are set to begin hearings with Cabinet secretaries and agency heads next week, where Trump administration officials will explain their individual funding requests and answer lawmakers' questions.The members on those committees will ultimately write the dozen annual appropriations bills in the months ahead, determining funding levels and policy for numerous programs, including those at the departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Interior, Justice, State and Transportation.The House panel’s bills will skew more toward Republican funding levels and priorities, though the Senate committee has a long history of writing broadly bipartisan bills. The leaders of the two committees — House Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., House ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Senate Chairwoman Collins and Senate ranking member Murray — will ultimately work out a final deal later in the year alongside congressional leaders.Differences over the full-year bills are supposed to be solved before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, but members of Congress regularly rely on a stopgap spending bill through mid-December to give themselves more time to complete negotiations.Failure to pass some sort of government funding measure, either a stopgap bill or all 12 full-year spending bills, before the funding deadline, would lead to a partial government shutdown.This round of appropriations bills will be the first debated during Trump’s second-term presidency and will likely bring about considerable disagreement over the unilateral actions the administration has already taken to freeze or cancel federal spending, many of which are the subject of lawsuits arguing the president doesn’t have that impoundment authority.",,,,2025-05-02 14:12:29.957091
,California,2025-05-02 17:23:49+00:00,CalMatters,California Democrats backed into a corner over teen sex solicitation,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/05/california-democrats-teen-sex-solicitation/,California Republicans are increasingly pushing Democrats on child sex crimes bills. The supermajority is growing more divided about it.,"In summary
California Republicans are increasingly pushing Democrats on child sex crimes bills. The supermajority is growing more divided about it.


California Republicans have developed something of a formula in the state Legislature. 
Push to raise penalties for certain kinds of sex crimes, like trafficking minors. Press the Democrats, many of whom remain wary of increasing prison sentences in the waning heyday of criminal justice reform, on the details. Have a field day in the media with the ensuing public outrage. 
It’s become a reliable way over the past three years to deliver small wins for the superminority party. Even if Republicans aren’t always successful at passing the legislation, they can use it to expose fault lines among the opposing party that dominates the Capitol, or even score some support from the state’s de facto Democratic leader, Gov. Gavin Newsom.
That strategy has led them to win bipartisan approval for bills to increase the penalties for child sex trafficking and soliciting 15-year-olds and under for sex.
The latest such episode exploded in the Assembly this week when Republicans tried to push Democrats to increase penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex or prostitution. That crime is a misdemeanor punishable by between two days to a year in jail. 
Solicitation involves asking for or arranging sex in exchange for money or something valuable; a host of other sex crimes involving minors of any age are felonies, including paying for and having sex with a minor.
This time, Republicans had the backing of freshman Democratic Assemblymember Maggy Krell, of Sacramento, who authored Assembly Bill 379. Krell objected on Tuesday when her colleagues removed the provision on soliciting older minors, saying fellow Democrats had forced her to agree to it on the threat the Public Safety committee would refuse to hold a hearing otherwise. 
When Republicans said they would try to add the provision into another bill on the floor on Thursday, she bucked Democratic leadership by supporting them. 
“We need to say, loud and clear, that if you’re under 18, a child, a minor … the person buying that person should be charged with a felony,” she said on the Assembly floor. “It’s plain and simple, sex without consent – that’s rape.”
Some moderate Democrats joined her, publicly chiding their colleagues for walking into a political landmine.
“Somehow, as our president tanks our economy and deports innocent children, the American people still don’t trust Democrats,” said Bakersfield Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains. “Any sane person knows that purchasing a 16- and 17-year-old for sex should be a felony, not a misdemeanor. This should not be a debate.”
A rare intervention from Newsom
Democrats already did the same thing last year. 
When they passed a Republican bill to increase penalties for soliciting minors, they carved out 16 and 17-year-olds out of concern the provision would treat older teenagers who are in consenting relationships the same as human traffickers. With the passage of that law, soliciting minors who are 15 or younger is punishable by up to three years in jail. 
Newsom, too, earlier this week issued a statement supporting the higher penalties for minors of all ages — a rare, but not unprecedented, intervention from a governor who occasionally chides fellow progressives when he thinks they’ve gone too far. 
The Republican effort failed on the Assembly floor Thursday, though it did garner some support from Democrats, like Bains. And it forced Democrats into a defensive mode. 
They inserted language into the bill expressing their “intent” to address the question of older teens, and continue debating the matter in future hearings this year. Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas also stripped Krell’s name from the bill and wrote in two Democratic co-authors, Assembly Public Safety Chair Nick Schultz and Elk Grove Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen, a moderate Democrat.
Schultz, a Burbank Democrat, said he plans to hold informational hearings on the issue and hopes to pass some form of amended bill this fall. The bill, without the higher penalties for soliciting older teens, is headed to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.
Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, a San Diego Republican, vowed to make Democrats pay for the move in the next election.
“I don’t think voters are going to fall for this, and I will spend every day working to ensure that,” he said. 
Progressives warn of ‘unintended harm’ to teens
Krell, a former prosecutor of sex crimes known for taking on the operators of the trafficking website Backpage, introduced AB 379 to target buyers of teenage victims in the sex trade. 
It’s supported by Republicans, organizations that help survivors, law enforcement, including Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper, and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis. The proposal would make it a crime to loiter with the intent to purchase sex, and would use the fines from those charges to fund services for trafficking survivors.

Krell’s fellow Democrats mostly don’t have a problem with that. But they objected to the bill’s inclusion of making the solicitation of 16- and 17-year-olds a “wobbler” on the first offense, meaning it could be charged as a misdemeanor or a felony. They had just removed an identical provision from a law by Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, of Bakersfield, last year, that made solicitation of 15-year-olds (or any minor who is a trafficking victim) a “wobbler” on first offense. 
Progressives, criminal justice reform advocates and other organizations that help survivors are concerned with blurry lines in some young people’s relationships. In a statement, Anne Irwin, director of Smart Justice California, said the provision “risked unintended harm to minors.”
Democrats said they don’t want to allow older teenagers to be charged with felonies if their parents don’t approve of an interracial or an LGBTQ consenting relationship. 
“Sending an 18-year-old high school senior to state prison for offering his 17-year-old classmate $20 to fool around isn’t smart criminal justice policy,” Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, wrote on social media this week. 
Wiener was one of the lawmakers who pushed for 16- and 17-year-olds to be removed last year. Through a spokesperson, he declined to comment further. 
Proponents of the legislation have said those concerns are largely hypothetical. They countered that prosecutors wouldn’t spend time charging teenagers who are having consensual sex. (The legal age of consent is 18.) Grove, who co-authored Krell’s bill, said though it’s already a felony to pay for sex with any minor, any conversation and deal-making that precedes that act should be stopped.
But Schultz and Rivas accused their critics of playing politics and misstating current laws. In addition to it being a felony to have sex with a minor, it is also a felony to contact any minor to commit sexual offense and to send sexual text messages to minors.
“No one in the room is OK with” minors being sold for sex, Rivas said. “This is a nuanced issue and conversation.”
Schultz would not share details of how he envisions changing the bill to include 16- and 17-year-olds later this year, but said he’s considering provisions that lessen penalties for the alleged offender if he’s close in age to the victim — similar to carve-outs in the state’s statutory rape laws. 
Rivas dismissed the idea the issue had become a political liability for Democrats. 
“It’s always high stakes around here,” he said. “Our commitment is to get it right.”

(File photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws.
When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry.
The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
With AI at their disposal, financial scammers are on the rise

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed.
Within two days of the company’s announcement, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson issued a consumer alert to Palmetto State customers.
“This company has sensitive information about the people who have used it,” he said in a March 25 statement. “The best way to protect your personal information is to delete your account.”
AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Texas also issued press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers.
But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As demand for AI rises, so do power thirsty data centers

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A district judge in Utah issued a marvelous decision on April 18, finding Utah’s school voucher law to be unconstitutional. The 60-page decision was based on a variety of constitutional flaws that the Utah law shares with Idaho’s recently-enacted education tax credit law. The Utah law was enacted in 2023 with $42.5 million in state funds. State funding increased by $40 million in each of the next two years.
The Utah judge said the Utah Constitution gives “a direct command to the legislature to perform a single duty: establish and maintain the state’s education systems.’” The judge continued, “This clear expression of one duty — coupled with the absence of any general duty to provide for the education or intellectual improvement of Utahns — impliedly restricts the legislature from creating a publicly funded school or education program outside of the public school system.” In other words, Utah’s Legislature is restricted from using public funds to support any form of private education.
Utah Fits All voucher program is ‘unconstitutional,’ district court rules

Of interest is the fact that every member of the Idaho Legislature was sent a “Legislative Alert” on the first day of the 2025 legislative session, warning that any scheme to use taxpayer money for private education would be violative of the Idaho Constitution in a number of respects. The alert was provided by The Committee to Protect and Preserve the Idaho Constitution, a group that participated in the successful lawsuit to overturn the restrictive initiative law enacted in 2021.
The alert identified the same constitutional flaw focused upon by the Utah judge — that Idaho’s Constitution prohibits the funding of private and parochial education. That has been the law of Idaho ever since statehood in 1890.
The alert spelled out several other constitutional infirmities that any voucher scheme would entail, including a deliberate transgression of Idaho’s strong prohibition against state support for religious education, discrimination against rural kids and Idaho religions that don’t operate parochial schools, lack of accountability for taxpayer money expended on private schooling, and diminution of state money necessary to support Idaho’s public school system, which has been chronically underfunded for decades.
The Utah judge’s decision mentioned a number of other infirmities in the Utah law — private schools often exclude students with special needs, or condition admission upon adherence to certain religious beliefs, or fail to provide “free” schooling as constitutionally required for taxpayer-supported education. These flaws are also inherent in House Bill 93, the subsidy bill approved by the Legislature this year.
The Idaho Legislature was clearly warned of the serious constitutional problems with House Bill 93, which will subsidize private and parochial education to the tune of $50 million in just the first year. Yet, because of massive funding from out-of-state groups that are seeking to weaken public schools across the nation, a majority of our legislators cast aside the Constitution and passed the subsidy bill. The governor lacked the courage to veto the legislation, despite overwhelming public outcry against it.
Now, as with the similar travesty in Utah, concerned Idahoans will have to resort to the courts in order to protect the wishes of Idaho’s constitutional drafters. Please stay tuned.

The Orange County Democrat stood and asked her colleagues to support legislation that would designate the fourth Thursday of March as “Tuskegee Airmen Commemoration Day” in North Carolina.
In 1941, the federal government established the 66th Air Force Flying School at Tuskegee Institute to train Black pilots for the war.
Almost 1,000 African Americans trained at the Army Airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama; and 450 of the men who completed training were sent overseas for combat duty. Most battled discrimination and other challenges not experienced by white individuals in the officially segregated U.S. military. And for those who survived, many such challenges persisted in the decades that followed — a phenomenon that DEI policies sought to combat.
“The Tuskegee Airmen were pilots, mechanics, bombardiers, navigators, crew members, nurses, and instructors,” Price said. “From 1943 to 1945 in the European Theatre, they provided escorts during bombing missions, helping the Allied Forces in achieving a victory in the global conflict that caused horrific destruction and casualties.”
The Tuskegee Airmen flew hundreds of patrol and attack missions — first flying older and less well-equipped P-40 and P-39 airplanes, before ultimately being reassigned to escort B-17 and B-24 heavy bombers, using P-47 and P-51 airplanes. They earned the nickname “Red Tails” from the distinctive painted tails of the Tuskegee fighter planes.
“I have a personal interest in this request,” Price shared. “Even though he was from New York State, my father was actually part of the 99th Pursuit Squadron and was with the 332nd Fighter Group.”
 Standing on their shoulders

Rep. Nasif Majeed (D-Mecklenburg) told members of the House that as a decorated Air Force combat pilot who flew 120 combat missions over North Vietnam, the history of the Tuskegee airmen was very dear to him.
“I stand on their shoulders,” said Majeed. “They were known as the Red Tails and all the bomber pilots said that because of their outstanding record, they wanted them to escort them because they lost fewer aircraft.”
The National WWII Museum notes that while 66 Tuskegee Airmen died in combat, it was one of the lowest loss records of any escort fighter group. They are credited with completing more than 1,500 missions, destroying 260 enemy aircraft, and sinking an enemy German destroyer.
Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) said it was a Tuskegee Airman who helped change the trajectory of his life.
After the war, Harold Webb became a teacher and a principal, and served as a leading force for school integration, according to the Raleigh Hall of Fame.

Governor Jim Hunt later appointed Webb as the first African American director of the Office of State Personnel in 1977. The former Tuskegee Airman worked to strengthen the state’s Equal Employment Opportunity program that was dedicated to diversifying and strengthening the state’s government workforce.
“I’m proud to be able to have a chance to vote for this bill,” Jones told his House colleagues.
 From aviator to prisoner of war 
Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) became emotional as he thought about his own father in World War II.
“He was shot down outside of Rome in January of 1944. He spent 16 months in a German prison camp.”
Adams said it was after his capture in a dark, crowded box car that his father met a fellow southerner and aviator named William E. Griffin from Montgomery, Alabama. Griffin took flight training at Tuskegee, earned his wings in 1943, and flew more than 23 flights over enemy territory.
“William E. Griffin became one of my dad’s best friends. They dug tunnels together. They cooked together. They exercised together. They did everything together for 16 months.”
  Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) said his father was held in a German prison camp during WWII. His best friend was one of the Tuskegee airmen. (Photo: NCGA live stream)
After the war, the two POWs lost touch.
Adams said his father was deeply saddened to learn in 1992 that Griffin died in 1969.
“Willie E. Griffin was the only Black guy in that prison camp. In the end of the war, there were 8,500 airmen there. But he was one of them. They were best friends. This is very special to me.”
Adams said it took years, but he made sure that letters his father had in Griffin’s own handwriting were returned to his daughter.
“He was very educated. He was a smart guy.”
Adams, a co-sponsor on the Tuskegee bill, joined 68 of GOP colleagues in voting to approve the bill to ban DEI programs.
Preserving the Tuskegee legacy amid efforts to dismantle DEI 
Earlier this year, in an effort to comply with Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion, the Air Force removed videos that included stories of the Tuskegee Airmen from the military’s training materials.
Bipartisan outcry over that hasty decision led Air Force officials to walk back the order.
Locally, the Heart of Carolina Chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen and the Wilson V. Eagleson Chapter are now seeking the special day of commemoration outlined in House Bill 254 to ensure that the history of America’s first Black military pilots and their triumph over adversity is never not forgotten.
HB254 won a rare unanimous vote (114-0) on Wednesday in the state House and now moves to the North Carolina Senate.

The status of other personnel was not immediately clear on Friday.
According to a Politico report last week, the Trump administration said in federal court it was reversing course and reinstating visas for many international students and alumni. 
Two Troy University students also had their visas reinstated.

“We are grateful that the administration is reevaluating its approach to the visas and status of international students. Attracting the brightest minds from around the world benefits us all,” Troy Chancellor Jack Hawkins wrote in a statement Monday. “International students make valuable contributions to critical industries through research, innovation and scholarship.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 1,024 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March.
Trump’s widespread immigration actions have also led to the wrongful arrest of several people with legal status, including Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia and three U.S. citizen children under the age of 10, including one with Stage 4 cancer.
Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student at the University of Alabama, was detained by Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) in March. Doroudi was denied bond on April 17, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not named any charges. 
A message seeking comment on Doroudi’s and other UA international students’ status was left with the University of Alabama Friday morning. President Donald Trump spoke at a commencement-related event at UA on Thursday where he praised his immigration policy.

(Photo by Maine Sea Grant)After an abrupt cancellation, funding for the Maine Sea Grant has been restored. 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notified the University of Maine this week that it was awarding three more years of funding for the Maine Sea Grant, according to a news release from the university Friday. The money for the upcoming year was made available immediately, while the remaining two years of funding will be contingent on future appropriations from Congress. 
“This vital funding for Maine Sea Grant is not a cost,” said lobsterman and marine biologist Curt Brown, in the release. “It is an investment in the future of Maine’s coastal industries and communities, an investment that has paid dividends for decades and will continue to support these iconic industries for generations to come.” 
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. It has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The restoration of funding comes after the university received a letter in late February stating that NOAA was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant because the grant’s work was “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.” 
Maine’s program seems to have been the only one in the country affected. The decision came about a week after President Donald Trump threatened Gov. Janet Mills during a heated exchange over the state not complying with an executive order barring transgender students from competing in women’s athletics.
Multiple members of Maine’s congressional delegation pushed back on the decision, calling for its reversal. For example, independent Sen. Angus King and Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree wrote a letter to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant that boosts research and economic development for coastal communities.
Republican Sen. Susan Collins also spoke with Lutnick about how Maine’s coastal communities could be hurt by ending that funding. Following that conversation, Vice Admiral Nancy Hann issued a memo that the department would renegotiate the Maine Sea Grant, according to a news release from Collins’ office. 
“The groundswell of support for Maine Sea Grant and the stories that have surfaced about its incredible impact on our state’s working waterfronts have been extraordinary and effective,” said UMaine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy. 
In line with the original four-year agreement, the award from the U.S. Department of Commerce this week was just shy of $1.5 million, the release said. That money will be matched by nearly $810,000 from non-federal sources, including industry and state research funding, as is required by the program. 
If Congress continues to fund the National Sea Grant College Program, it will provide $3 million in additional funding to the Maine Sea Grant through Jan. 31, 2028. That would be matched by another $1.6 million, the release added. 
That money will allow the Maine Sea Grant to continue fostering coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
Every federal dollar spent to support those activities resulted in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million in 2023, the release said.

Mike Braun signs a pair of executive orders dealing with unemployment insurance in his Statehouse office on Thursday, Feb. 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun signed a whopping 56 bills into law Friday, including measures setting contentious work requirements for certain Medicaid recipients and evaluating the addition of secessionist Illinois counties to Indiana. 
Twenty of the bills came from the Senate, led by Senate Enrolled Act 2 — which would require enrollees under the Healthy Indiana Plan to either work or volunteer for 20 hours a week or risk losing their benefits. The proposal includes over a dozen exemptions and must also get the stamp of approval from the federal government before being enacted, however. 
Other Senate ideas include a handful of health bills — one reforming prior authorization requirements and a wide-ranging omnibus package — along with public safety and energy matters. 
One adopts a new set of eyewitness identification procedures — a move celebrated by exonerees wrongly convicted of crimes partly due to mistaken eyewitness identification.

The Innocence Project reports that over a third of wrongful convictions stem from such errors, including Indiana’s Leon Benson. Benson spent over 24 years imprisoned for a murder he didn’t commit. 
A small modular nuclear reactor pilot program will also move forward, part of a package of bills drafted with the intention of bringing the technology to Indiana. 
Among the 36 House-originated bills signed Friday were three chamber GOP priorities.
House Enrolled Act 1005 continues incentivizing housing construction while House Enrolled Act 1006 creates a prosecutor review board to scrutinize so-called “noncompliant” prosecutors. 
The final priority measure, House Enrolled Act 1008, establishes a commission to study Hoosier absorption of secessionist Illinois counties — though such a move would also require Prairie State consent and federal approval. 
Other House bills set to become law following Braun’s signature include an Indiana National Guard enlistment boost, a “Medicaid diversion program,” and new pediatric cancer research grants. 
Additionally, a transportation infrastructure funding revamp will change how communities fund roads, bridges and more. It eases barriers to tolling and changes up the popular Community Crossings Matching Grant Program. The measure will also increase the speed limit on Interstate 465.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Detroit by the Sugar Law Center and American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, asserts the university’s actions are in violation with the employees’ constitutional rights of freedom of speech, petition and assembly.
The university attributed all firings and blacklisting to violations of the school’s policies on community violence, but the lawsuit states neither the seven student employees nor the full-time employee who faced repercussions for their participation in protests on campus enacted any sort of violence and complied with police instructions during the events.

Civic engagement has long been a hallmark of the university community, the lawsuit states, noting University of Michigan students throughout history have protested for different causes on campus including demanding an end to the Vietnam War.
But as members of the university community hold protests demanding the university divest from companies tied to Israel’s war in Gaza, the lawsuit states that since the deadly October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, the university has completely changed its response to protest activity on campus.
“Since October 7, 2023, the University has solely targeted, discriminated against, and punished students for engaging in speech and protest activity in support of Palestine and calling for the University to divest from Israel as a means of pressuring Israel to cease human rights violations against the Palestinian people, including crimes against humanity and genocide,” the lawsuit says. 
The lawsuit notes that divestment is a reasonable effort for protesters to pursue as the university has divested before, including divesting from tobacco companies in 2000, South Africa in the 1970’s and 80’s and Russia in 2022. The lawsuit further notes that never before has peaceful participation in protests on the university’s Ann Arbor campus resulted in termination or permanent ineligibility for rehire, as it has for these employees.
University of Michigan spokesperson Kay Jarvis said, “the university does not comment on litigation” in response to Michigan Advance’s request for comment on the lawsuit.
The protests at the heart of the lawsuit are a November 17, 2023 sit-in protest outside the university president’s office and a May 3, 2024 protest outside of the University of Michigan Museum of Art.
During the May 2024 protest, the lawsuit said protestors stood outside the art museum while several of the university’s regents were inside the building for a private event. Protestors linked arms and chanted and moved back to continue their protest after university police set up a barrier around the entrance of the art museum.
Months later, five university employees who participated in the protest were sent correspondence informing them that their employment was terminated and they were permanently not eligible for rehire for violating the university policies against community violence. 
Four of the individuals who were fired months after the protest were not employees of the university when the protest was held, according to the lawsuit, which added that all the former employees who participated in the November 2023 and May 2024 protests participated in their own personal time.
During the November 2023 protest, the lawsuit says one particular student, Zaynab Elkolaly, attempted to join the sit-in protest outside the university president’s office, entering the Ruthvan Building, when she became caught between a crowd trying to enter the building and police officers at the entrance.
“While turned away from the entrance to leave and with her back to the police, she was grabbed from behind and thrown to the ground by a University of Michigan police officer. While being thrown to the ground, her hijab was ripped off,” the lawsuit says.
Months later, after Elkolaly had graduated and was no longer an employee at the university, but was planning on applying for work at the school, she received a letter from the university saying she was ineligible for rehire due to violating the school’s policies against violence.
“Each of the Plaintiffs was a dedicated University employee who took their job duties seriously, conducted exemplary work, and performed necessary services for the University,” the lawsuit states, adding that the processes the university enacted to terminate employment or bar future employment for the former employees robbed them of due process to combat retaliation by the university for their civic engagement.
The lawsuit seeks to force the university to repeal actions it took against the plaintiffs’ employment statuses, recover damages from loss of employment and any other relief that would be considered just in this scenario.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Facetune_14-03-2025-16-48-50-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 13:10:40.194688

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Despite widespread support from business and environmental groups alike, the Senate voted Thursday to stall a bill that would create a paint recycling program in the state.
House Bill 451, led by bipartisan sponsors, aims to give residents and businesses a responsible way to get rid of their cans, while also keeping paint — which can contain harmful chemicals such as PFAS — out of the state’s landfills. But senators, citing concerns such as the fee added to paint cans to fund the program, moved to rerefer the bill to committee, likely delaying further action on the legislation until the fall.
“It’s been successful in every other state that we’ve launched a program (in),” said Heidi K. McAuliffe, the senior vice president of government affairs for the American Coatings Association. “I was really hopeful that this would be the year the bill would get through. But if it’s not this year, we’ll work towards next year.”
The program would allow retailers to volunteer as drop-off sites for the cans, with no cost paid by residents or businesses at the time of drop-off. Businesses can also arrange, at no cost, for PaintCare, the nonprofit of the trade association that runs the program across states, to pick up large amounts of cans.
The program is funded through fees added to paint cans. The cost added to each can varies by state, the size of the container, the cost of transportation and processing, and paint sales in the state, McAuliffe said. It would be after the legislation passes that PaintCare would work with an independent financial auditor to evaluate those costs, she said.
Fees where the program currently exists — in 10 states and the District of Columbia — range between 30 cents and 65 cents for containers larger than half a pint but smaller than 1 gallon. For cans between 1 to 2 gallons, that fee is between 65 cents and $1.35. For those larger than 2 gallons to 5 gallons, it’s between $1.50 and $2.45 per can. For the smallest containers, there’s typically no cost, McAuliffe said.
Before the vote, Sen. Victoria Sullivan, a Manchester Republican, called the bill “the same paint tax that we’ve been fighting for years,” and “a tax on every single can of paint that is purchased.” But the prime sponsor of the bill refuted that labeling, as does PaintCare.
“The comments about this being a tax — it’s obviously not a tax,” said Rep. Karen Ebel, a New London Democrat, “because the state isn’t getting anything. It’s not a user fee, in the classic sense, because the state isn’t getting anything. We’re basically, by not allowing this program to go forward, we’re basically telling business, ‘No, you can’t do what you want to do.’”
The inception of the program comes from paint manufacturers themselves, who in the early 2000s began working on the idea as they considered how to best manage the end-life of their products. 
In New Hampshire, the bill united groups that may typically be seen as unlikely allies, including Casella Waste Systems, the Vermont-based company at the center of contentious landfill conversations in the state; Waste Management; the Conservation Law Foundation; and a consortium of environmental groups, including the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, The Nature Conservancy, the Audubon Society, and others.
Natch Greyes, a lobbyist for the Business and Industry Association, which supports the bill, said the legislation helps avoid antitrust concerns that could be raised by manufacturers enacting the program on their own.
“We really need authorization from the Legislature to make sure that if we start up a program like this, that we’re not going to run into any sort of trouble on the antitrust realm,” Greyes said. “And so that’s really the whole basis for the bill, is that we need to do those protections. And the justification is, obviously, this is a great public benefit.”
The bill aims to cut down costs for Household Hazardous Days. Last year, municipalities spent at least $150,000 on paint disposal, according to the bill’s fiscal note, which added that the statewide cost is “likely to be much higher” than that figure.
Ebel said it could also help drive traffic to retailers who choose to participate as drop-off locations. Aubuchon Hardware, which has 17 stores in New Hampshire, provided testimony in support of the bill, while other retailers were neutral, Ebel said. 
“For over 10 years, Aubuchon has participated in PaintCare’s network of volunteer retail collection sites in Vermont, Maine, and Connecticut,” wrote Joseph Houssan, vice president of resource for the company, “We have found that not only does the program allow us to provide a benefit to the community, our customers like the program and the opportunity to bring back leftover paint brings more customers into our store.”
Additionally, Ebel, who chairs the state’s Solid Waste Working Group, said the bill would help New Hampshire meet its goals to reduce waste going into its landfills. The state has a statutory goal to reduce solid waste, in weight, by 25% by 2030 and 45% by 2050. 
“We’re trying to landfill less and less, and this would have been tremendous assistance in that,” Ebel said.
Sen. Timothy Lang, the Sanbornton Republican who made the motion to rerefer the bill, said: “I want to get to ‘yes,’ and I’m going to be working with the prime sponsor, as well as the manufacturers and other people in the industry, to try to get to that.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/paintcansbill-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 13:10:40.194688

(Contributed/Snohetta)The North Dakota Legislature removed $50 million in state funding for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library endowment, but indicated the proposal may be back next session.
The funding was removed from the Department of Commerce budget in a compromise between the House and the Senate. The House earlier had advanced the proposal to help the library with operational costs, but some objected to the funding being proposed so late in the session. 
“There have been no hearings or any kind of consideration in the Senate,” Sen. Michael Dwyer, R-Bismarck, said during floor discussion on Senate Bill 2018.
The library is under construction in Medora near Theodore Roosevelt National Park, with a grand opening planned for July 4, 2026.
Lawmakers in 2019 approved $50 million in state funding for a library endowment.
North Dakota House advances $50M in state funds for presidential library 

Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, advocated for additional library endowment funding, which would have been contingent on the library matching the dollars with private funds. On Friday, he said legislators could revisit the proposal in the session that begins in January 2027. At that time, lawmakers would have a better idea of the operational costs after the library has been operating for a few months. 
“We can then take a look at it at a little bit more leisurely pace and take our time to delve into this,” Nathe said.
Several lawmakers said they were told in 2019 that there would not be additional state funding requested for the presidential library.
“I do remember it being expressed as a one-time funding type of deal,” said Rep. Jeff Hoverson, R-Minot. He added the critics of the original funding were proven right six years later.
The state Parks and Recreation budget also contains a $70 million line of credit through the state-owned Bank of North Dakota for the library, continuing what lawmakers approved in 2023. The loan, which can only be used for construction costs, is meant to keep the project moving if there are donations that have been pledged but not yet received by the library foundation. So far, the library has not accessed the line of credit. 
The budget for the state Industrial Commission includes up to $5 million for the presidential library to pay for some of the interest to the Bank of North Dakota if the line of credit is used.
The Industrial Commission budget had not been approved by lawmakers as of Friday morning.
North Dakota Senate rejects proposal to replace Chinese-made drones

Previously, Matt Briney, spokesperson for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, said the group had raised $286 million in private donations as of mid-April. 
The overall Department of Commerce budget sent to the governor includes $9 million for the state to replace state-owned drones that were made in China, which supporters say pose security concerns. The Senate had previously rejected a similar proposal, but compromised on a reduced amount in the Commerce budget.
The bill also contains a name change for the Office of Legal Immigration, which lawmakers established in 2023. The new name would be the Global Talent Office, to better reflect the agency’s work.

Laura Kelly continued to recommend cautious conservatism in terms of cuts to state taxes despite an unexpected boost in income and sales tax receipts.,"Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins offered different perspectives on a state tax revenue report for April that showed collections above expectations but below receipts in April 2024. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Revenue from income, sales and an assortment of tobacco, liquor and energy taxes in Kansas exceeded projections in April by 1.3%, but represented a year-to-year decline of $83 million from April 2024, state officials said.
The state reported $1.33 billion in total tax collections last month as the Kansas Department of Revenue took in $17.6 million more than anticipated by state fiscal analysts. The monthly total represented a reduction in revenue of 5.9% from April of last year.
“Kansas’ current financial health is strong, but we must remain committed to fiscally responsible budgeting to ensure lasting stability in the future,” said Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican expected to seek the GOP nomination for insurance commissioner in 2026, said the latest monthly report indicated the governor’s hesitancy to support larger tax cuts was misplaced. In June 2024, Kelly signed a three-year $1.3 billion tax cut bill.
“It’s very encouraging to see April revenue numbers come in greater than expected,” Hawkins said.
He said the monthly report in April demonstrated Kelly’s “dire predictions were all just an attempt to derail much-needed tax relief.”
In the 2025 legislative session, the Republican-led House and Senate passed a bill earmarking future state revenue surpluses to reduction in individual or corporate income tax rates. Lawmakers had promised to focus on property tax reform during the annual session, and did replace a 1.5-mill state property tax levy with revenue from income and sales tax collections.

“I hope in the future the governor will stop with the doom and gloom and join us in looking out for the best interests of Kansas families,” Hawkins said.
In April, individual income tax collections were $684 million, which amounted to an unexpected surged of $10 million. That total was 1.5% above the monthly estimate. In April 2024, the state took in $740 million in individual income taxes. That equated to a year-to-year decline of $55 million or 7.5%.


Corporate income tax collections in Kansas settled at $316 million last month, the Department of Revenue said. That was $1.3 million or 0.4% greater than projected. However, the tally was below the $338 million received in April 2024 and amounted to a reduction of 6.4% or $21 million from a year ago.
The Department of Revenue said state retail sales and compensating use tax receipts for April were $296 million — $5.5 million or 1.9% above the estimate. In April 2024, Kansas took in $1.2 million or 0.4% less in sales and compensating use taxes.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kansas-Capitol-sw-corner-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-02 12:20:18.510376

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A slew of business organizations, as well as AARP and several former members of the Iowa Utilities Commission, are opposing an energy bill proposed by the governor, because they say it would negatively affect Iowa ratepayers. 
In addition to granting existing utilities the right of first refusal to new transmission projects, House File 834 and Senate File 585 expand the projects that can pursue ratemaking principles and set rules for utility resource planning. 
Opponents argue these elements of the bills would give big utilities a “carte-blanche” to add more capital investments in the state regardless of impact to ratepaying Iowans. 
Utility companies MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy are in favor of the bill and disagreed with the assertions that it would not benefit ratepayers.
“The policies in the bill allow us to deliver on our promise to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy when our customers need it,” a spokesperson for MidAmerican said in a statement.

Five former members of the Iowa Utilities Commission, or the Iowa Utilities Board as it was formerly titled, penned a letter to lawmakers and urged them to pause the current legislation. 
The letter said the bill has potential to “shift the risk/benefit ratemaking balance away from ratepayers and towards investors.” 
Ratemaking 
In the early 2000s, Iowa authorized ratemaking principles to account for the added risk of investments into alternative energy sources, like wind and solar, which were new at the time.
These principles, according to the letter from former IUC members, “freed” regulators from traditional ratemaking principles and granted them “premium” returns on equity at levels that ranged between 1% to 2% above the national average. 
The bill would expand the projects eligible for these ratemaking principles with the intent of attracting energy storage and nuclear electric power generation facilities in the state.  
“With these changes, Iowa ratepayers could be paying some of the highest (return on equities) in the country for another round of very large utility investments,” the letter read. 
Legislation sets regulations for anaerobic digesters on livestock operations in Iowa

The former IUC members cited a report completed by an outside firm in 2023, per requests of the Iowa Legislature, to review Iowa utility ratemaking laws and procedures. 
The study found that rate-regulated utilities can receive advanced ratemaking approval with “relative ease” and that the IUC had limited ability to “determine whether an asset would truly benefit the electric system and the ratepayers that pay for it.” 
It also said precedent around advanced ratemaking “facilitates infrastructure build-up without thorough assessment by the IU(C)” 
The former IUC members said they “commend legislators for taking ratemaking reform seriously” but they recommend “pausing the current legislation” or amending the bill, to better address the issue in a way that “protects ratepayers.”
Geoff Greenwood, media relations manager for MidAmerican, said the letter “ignores” that the returns can “only be approved if they are found to be in the public’s interest.” 
“MidAmerican’s track record over the past two decades proves that the policies in the bill allow us to deliver on our promise to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy when our customers need it,” Greenwood said in a statement. 
He said returns on equity are approved “after a robust process” in the IUC with input from the Office of the Consumer Advocate and customers. Greenwoods said the returns are “not ‘premium’” because they “reflect the cost and risk of long-term investments” as they are applied to the 30- to 40-year lifespan of a facility. 
Latest figures from MidAmerican point to average utility rates in Iowa that are 44% below the national average.
“The use of ‘non-traditional’ advance ratemaking principles is exactly what has made Iowa exceptional and resulted in some of the lowest electricity rates in the country,” Greenwood said.
He said MidAmerican additionally uses a method of revenue sharing that allows the company to use revenue, beyond a certain level of return, to “pay off company generating facilities so that customers won’t bear those costs in the future.” 
“This customer-first mechanism incentivizes MidAmerican to better manage its operations and, when that happens, customers benefit,” Greenwood said in the statement.
The bill would also remove the requirement that projects are a baseload electric power generating facility, or one that essentially operates at all times, and lowers the generating capacity of the facility from at least 300 megawatts to 40 megawatts. 
Bob Rafferty, with Iowa Businesses for Clean Energy which is one of the groups opposed to the bill, said these changes would allow companies to seek higher ratemaking principles on projects like gas peaker plants. 
Per MidAmerican documents, a newly proposed $600 million peaker plant project would work when demand is high, and is expected to operate less than 10% of the year. 
A fact sheet on the plants say they are a “key addition” to the company’s “all-of-the-above generation strategy” to meet the expected increased demand of the next 20 years. 
But Rafferty said utility companies have an incentive to build more capital assets, like generating stations and transmission lines, because they can profit from them. 
He said it’s “important” to make sure the system doesn’t allow a company to determine how many capital assets they need to build, as he alleges the bill would do. 
Resource planning 
Opponents are also worried about a line in the bill that says utilities should submit resource plans to the IUC that “reflect the circumstances and management judgment of an electric utility.” Rafferty said this means an investor-owned utility would have to create its resource plans in line with what would benefit its shareholders, rather than ratepayers. 
Iowa is currently one of a handful of states that does not require an integrated resource plan, defined by Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance as an examination of energy supply, demand and potential risks to meeting demand at a reasonable cost.

Gov. Kim Reynolds’ energy plan for the state, on which the bill is based, notes the need for integrated resource planning, or IRP, to comprehensively look at what energy sources will be needed for further growth in the state.
Current law requires utilities to submit energy efficiency plans every five years, with five- or  20-year energy needs forecasts. 
Rafferty said when a utility proposes an investment be considered for ratemaking principles, the utilities commission doesn’t get the “big picture” of the project’s impact on the state without an IRP. 
“What the IRP should do is require it to be in the ratepayers’ best interest, and the Iowa Utility Commission needs to be empowered to make sure that that is, in fact, the case,” he said.
ROE Letter 4-24-25
 Former members of the Iowa Utilities Commission, Richard Lozier, Jr., Geri Huser, Sheila Tipton, Darrell Hanson and John Norris wrote a letter to legislators opposing the bill.
Under the bill, the Iowa Utilities Commission may make recommendations to the utilities on the resource plan, and the company must “make a good faith effort” to inform and include suggestions from the commissioners, consumer advocate and stakeholders. 
“The legislation, as it’s currently constructed … would give the utilities a carte blanche to make any investment that they want and to earn a premium return on equity,” Rafferty said. 
Rafferty as part of Iowa Businesses for Clean Energy, has banded with lobbyists from Iowa Business Energy Coalition, AARP, Iowa Economic Alliance, National Federation of Independent Business, Iowa Retail Federation and LSPower in opposition of the bill and to suggest lawmakers either “fix it or forget it.”
An amendment suggested by the bill opponents would make it so that facilities outlined in resource plans are “in customers’ best interests.” 
The proposed amendment would also allow the IUC to approve, reject or modify a resource plan and would greatly expand the ability of stakeholders to participate and weigh in on the plans. 
The bill, as is, stipulates a resource plan should “consider all reasonable resources” and should include “adequate, cost-effective, and reliable energy service considering costs, fuel diversity, and probable future demand for energy.” 
Rafferty said legislators need to think of utility rates like they think about taxes for Iowans. 
“Their vote will determine whether taxes go up, or taxes don’t go up,” he said.
A spokesperson from Alliant Energy said the bill will “strengthen and help grow Iowa communities to meet the state’s future energy needs.” 
“We commend Governor Reynolds for leading on energy policy that promotes an all-the-above energy strategy, enhances customer transparency and participation for generation planning and is focused on driving economic development in this state,” the spokesperson said in an email.
Greenwood with MidAmerican said the bill is important in updating Iowa’s policies that “have been effective for customers for decades” and will keep the state from “falling behind other states.” 
“Simply put, Iowa’s energy policy – as it is currently as well as the bill’s proposed updates – works for Iowans,” Greenwood said. 
Lawmakers noted during House hearings in early February the bill would have some amendments before it would be ready for floor debate. As legislators close out the 110th day of session, the bill remains stuck in a Senate appropriations committee and a House subcommittee. 
House Speaker Pat Grassley said Thursday to reporters that the caucus is focusing on the budget before “taking up significant pieces of policy.” When asked specifically about ROFR and the energy bill as a whole, the Republican leader said “it’s still pretty divided” among representatives.

(Photo by Beth Wallis/StateImpact Oklahoma)The Oklahoma Ethics Commission is settling another campaign finance issue with State Superintendent Ryan Walters.
The Republican will pay $18,300 for an improper transfer of funds from his campaign war chest to a local school board election committee in Jenks.
The payment was $2,100 to the local campaign committee, “Cross for Jenks,” which backed candidate Ashley Cross for school board in the district. She expressed concern about “oversexualization” in schools during her 2022 election bid. She eventually lost to incumbent school board member Terry Keeling.
The total payment must be received by the end of September, according to the settlement. The first installment of $5,000 is due on May 30.
It’s the second time Walters has paid a fine in recent months, after another $5,000 settlement for improper use of his official social media account for political purposes in March. In that case, the Commission found 10 of Walters’ social media posts advocating for the election of President Donald Trump and the defeat of former Vice President Kamala Harris violated Oklahoma Ethics Rules.
In good news for Walters, the Ethics Commission also dismissed a separate complaint against him for endorsing an alternative membership organization to a union for teachers, which a Democratic lawmaker had brought.
Rep. Ellyn Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City, filed the complaint. She told StateImpact that state law provides two avenues for potential violations: using state resources for private purposes and the obligation of state officers to avoid conflicts of interest and preferential treatment. She argued that the union was a private organization and that public resources should not be used for advocacy on its behalf.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”

HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

This week: May Day demonstrations decry Trump; unemployment benefits hang over state budget deal; strike averted at HealthPartners; governor exempts more workers from return-to-office order; and labor market proves resilient amid economic turmoil. 
May Day demonstrations decry assault on workers, immigrants
Fury at the Trump administration’s assault on unions and immigrants fueled annual May Day demonstrations across the country and in Minnesota, where thousands of people filled the Capitol lawn in St. Paul on Thursday with simultaneous rallies in Duluth, Rochester, St. Peter, Northfield and Brainerd.
“Immigrant rights and labor rights are human rights, and it’s really important to stand up with what’s happening in D.C.,” said Shari Wojtowicz, an AT&T employee and president of the state council of the Communication Workers of America union, in an interview before the rally in St. Paul.
Union leaders and immigrant rights activists decried Trump’s moves to deport undocumented immigrants, hamstring the National Labor Relations Board and rescind collective bargaining rights for federal employees.
They urged the crowd to remember their power in speeches inflected with references to significant historical events: the Delano Grape Strike and Boycott; Martin Luther King Jr.’s final speech to the striking sanitation workers in Memphis; President Reagan firing the air traffic controllers; and the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886 during a protest for an 8-hour workday, which May Day commemorates.
The event featured Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants, who became a celebrity of the labor movement in 2019 when she called for a general strike and was credited with helping end the 35-day government shutdown.

She began her speech by belting out a stanza from the old labor song, “Solidarity Forever.”
“It is we who plowed the prairies; built the cities where they trade;
Dug the mines and built the workshops, endless miles of railroad laid;
Now we stand outcast and starving midst the wonders we have made;
But the union makes us strong.” 
Nelson renewed her call for a general strike. Like the 1934 Minneapolis general strike, she reminded the crowd.
“That’s the working class power that had corporations begging for labor law,” Nelson said. “Musk and the oligarchs have money and control, but we have the power. Nothing can move without our labor. And it’s time that we exercise our power in a united working class.”
Earlier in the day, Nelson met with workers at the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport and said the union is closer than it’s ever been to filing for a union election for Delta flight attendants.
Marching with the crowd from the Capitol, Alison Jones, a union English Language Learner teacher in the Minneapolis Public Schools, said she came to show her support for workers’ rights and her students, some of whom have stopped coming to class out of fear of deportations.
“People should be able to go to school and not worry,” Jones said.
Unemployment benefits become sticking point at Legislature
  (Photo courtesy Minnesota House of Representatives Public Information Services)
Unemployment benefits for bus drivers, teachers’ aides and other hourly school employees is becoming a major sticking point in budget negotiations at the state Capitol.
In 2023, Minnesota became the first state to offer unemployment to hourly school workers in the summer months, providing a financial cushion that has long been available to other seasonal workers like those in construction. But the $135 million the state set aside for the benefits in 2023 is running dry, meaning school districts could soon be on the hook for the added expense.
On Monday, the Democratic and Republican co-chairs of the House Education Finance Committee unveiled an agreement that would set aside an additional $30 million for unemployment benefits to carry school districts through this summer and then repeal the benefit in 2029.
But House Democrats in the Rules Committee showed they weren’t willing to go along with the deal from leadership when they voted against advancing the education budget bill to the House floor for a full vote, so long as it included the provision stripping hourly school employees of the benefit.
Meanwhile, the Senate passed a bill extending unemployment benefits for more than 600 steelworkers at two northern mines from 26 weeks to 52 weeks. The proposal sailed through the narrowly divided Senate with support from Republicans, who are increasingly sensitive to the needs of miners on the now reliably red Iron Range.
That raises the possibility that miners — predominantly white men earning upwards of $100,000 a year — could receive a full year of unemployment benefits while hourly school workers — predominantly women and people of color earning around $17 an hour on average — would be stripped of all benefits. Beyond the issue of fairness, Democrats who vote to repeal benefits for hourly school workers would be running afoul of the Service Employees International Union, an important ally that represents school workers.
“What our caucus has clearly said is we are not going to pit workers against each other. We believe everyone should have the economic security of unemployment insurance,” said Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, who authored the bill in 2023 extending unemployment to hourly school workers.
1,000 HealthPartners workers reach deal, call off strike
Ahead of a 10-day strike set to begin on Monday, HealthPartners and the union representing about 1,000 front-desk and office support workers reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract that raises wages and preserves health insurance benefits.
The workers, who are represented by OPEIU Local 12, voted to authorize a strike in January for the first time in decades over the company’s proposals to increase health insurance premiums and introduce co-pays for the first time, while offering wage increases that didn’t match inflation.
“The tradeoff for many years was being able to have a gold standard health plan meant taking less in wages,” said Devin Hogan, president of OPEIU Local 12. “Wages have fallen so far behind that people can’t make a living.”
The details of the tentative agreement were not immediately public, but Hogan said the union was pushing for raises that restored the $3.50 per hour in buying power that inflation ate away since the pandemic. The starting wage for OPEIU workers is around $19 an hour.
Governor expands return-to-office exemption
Gov. Tim Walz’s administration exempted more state employees from his order that most employees return to the office 50% of the time beginning June 1.
In a memo published this week, Minnesota Management and Budget said workers who live more than 50 miles from the office — instead of the previous 75 — can work from home.
The order has faced intense backlash from the state’s largest union, Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, which has raised the possibility of a strike and compared Walz to billionaire Elon Musk, who has championed full-time return-to-office at the federal government.
The Walz administration says the move will improve collaboration and communication, while MAPE argues the order will only hurt retention and recruitment without improving productivity.
“We view this as a cosmetic adjustment to an inherently flawed policy that continues to disrupt state operations, require unnecessary costs, and destabilize the workforce without addressing any clear operational need,” MAPE President Megan Dayton said in a statement to the Reformer.
MAPE is currently negotiating a new labor contract with state leaders and has proposed that they be entitled to work remotely unless the state can “clearly and convincingly demonstrate that essential job functions of the position cannot be completed when telecommuting.”
Labor market withstands shrinking economy
The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April and unemployment remained unchanged at 4.2%, two closely watched metrics as the Trump administration’s trade war, federal funding cuts and reduction of the federal workforce roil the economy.
The better-than-expected jobs report on Friday suggests the labor market has remained strong so far despite worrying signs elsewhere. The U.S. economy shrank 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, the stock market has been on a rollercoaster ride, and retailers are cancelling orders from overseas, raising the specter of a return to empty store shelves from the COVID-19 era.
“The ‘R’ word that the labor market is demonstrating in this report is resilience, certainly not recession,” Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in Bloomberg. “For now, we should curb our enthusiasm going forward given the backdrop of trade policies that will likely be a drag on the economy.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250501_0056-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-02 12:20:18.510376

But that first third of 2025 was still much warmer than the average in the mid-1900s in central Connecticut, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
For example, from 1949 through 1987, the average January-April daily temperature was about 34.5 degrees. From 1987 through 2025, it was 2 degrees warmer, at 36.5 degrees, and since 2010, it’s been about 37.2 degrees — a stretch that included the brutal winter of 2015.
The winters and early springs of 2002, 2012, 2023 and 2024 each featured average temperatures above 40 degrees for the January-April period — temperatures not seen at any other point in the last 75 years.
While summers have been getting warmer overall since 1949, the increase hasn’t been as sharp as the change in the winters of the year. The average May-August temperature from 1949 through 1987, for example, was about 68 degrees, compared to 1987 through 2025, which was about 69.1 degrees.

Bernie Sanders calls on Democrats to “stop defending the status quo economically” during May Day rally in Philadelphia,"A crowd rallies outside of Philadelphia City Hall on May 1, 2025. (Capital-Star photo by John Cole)Pennsylvania’s capital and largest city were home to May Day rallies on Thursday – as people took to the streets to protest President Donald Trump’s economic, social, and immigration policies.
A few thousand traveled to Philadelphia on a warm Thursday afternoon to celebrate a “Workers over Billionaires” rally, hosted by the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, featuring U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
Daniel Bauder, President of the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, described Philadelphia as the “birthplace of America’s labor movement.”
In the current moment, Bauder said he thinks a lot about the 1960s and the struggles of the Civil Rights  labor movements during that era and how the two worked together. He thinks there’s “so many opportunities” for labor and human rights groups to join together to meet the moment.
Debra Boston, who made her way from Lackawanna County, stood outside Philadelphia City Hall with her sign, more than two hours before Sanders took the stage.
“My rights, the Constitution, deplorable president,” she said, as the reason she made the trip.

Attendees and speakers alike were united against the Trump administration. Philadelphia added its voice to Sanders’ rallies, which he has dubbed the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour.
Trump celebrated 100 days in office this week with a rally in Michigan.
Paula Paul, a member of the Granny Peace Brigade Philadelphia, is a fan of Sanders, but noted he wasn’t the only reason she was on hand.
“We came because we’re part of the movement trying to raise issues against the current regime,” she said. “We want our grandchildren to know, our neighbors to know, that we’re standing up against many of the current policies and the disrespect and disregard for human life.”
A few who spoke with the Capital-Star, who opposed Trump in the 2024 election, said he’s been worse than they’d expected.
Carol Rogers, an AFSCME District Council 47 retiree, lives in Philadelphia. She said she’s “heartbroken” with how Trump has conducted himself during his presidency. She said she was disappointed, as an activist, how he is putting an end to the strides the nation has made over the past few decades to end racial discrimination.
“It’s a very frightening time for everybody,” Rogers said.
Robert Frederick, a veteran who lives in Philadelphia, said he was at a protest at Mar-A-Lago in Florida about a month ago and described Trump’s first 100 days as a “circus.”
“He has no ability to govern,” Frederick said.
While Trump’s approval rating has shrunk, the Democratic Party also currently isn’t gaining in popularity.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One thing most who spoke with the Capital-Star in Philadelphia agreed on is they want Democrats to be more vocal.
“They need to get together and fight. Some of them are fighting, but they don’t have any unified fighting,” said Joan Lukas, another member of the Granny Peace Brigade Philadelphia.
“I think they need to stand up, they need to go after him and they need to just throw themselves up here, because they work for us, and they’re not working for us right now,” Boston said.
Sanders, saying May Day “in a sense, is a sacred holiday,” celebrated the impact that the trade union movement has had on American society. But, he spoke at length about the concerns he has with the current state of the country, directing blame at the Trump administration and others who support him.

“Brothers and sisters, our job right now, in my view, is two fold,” Sanders said. “First, we have got to fight Trump every single day. Secondly, we need to have a vision as to where our country goes in the future.”
“And here is the bottom line and I say that to my Democratic colleagues in the Congress. Stop defending the status quo economically,” he added.
Rev. Gregory Edwards, Executive Director of POWER Interfaith, called for a “moral revolution” during his speech and echoed the power of a joint effort between labor and faith.
“We have been here before,” Edwards said. “We have seen what happens when profits are placed above people. When workers are pushed to the margins, but history also shows us that when labor and faith come together, mountains can be moved, wages can be raised, policies can be changed and communities, neighborhoods, streets can flourish.”
The immigration issue was also on the minds of those on hand.
“I am Kilmar Abrego Garcia, I am Mahmoud Khalil,” said Jimmy Williams Jr., General President of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT) to applause. “We all are one.”
The recent detention of Garcia and Khalil have garnered headlines nationwide and have resulted in some protests.

There was no shortage of criticism towards Elon Musk during the speeches in Philadelphia, as well as on signs held by various attendees.
No Pennsylvania elected officials took the stage to speak during the rally, but U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-5th District), state Rep. Joe Hohenstein (D-177th District), and Philadelphia Councilmembers Jim Harrity, a Democrat, and Nicolas O’Rourke, a member of the Working Families Party, were in attendance.
Williams called for solidarity with the rest of the American labor movement and thanked Sanders for being present on Thursday to “tell us the truth and a vision for the future.”
“Today, on May Day, we as the working class must declare our independence from both political parties,” Williams said. “We stand up for what’s right. We have to look and stare down every politician and tell them that if you don’t stand with us, we don’t stand with you.”
‘A reason for everyone to scream’
The protest in Harrisburg, which organizers estimate brought around 400 attendees, had no big name speakers. But union leaders and activists played songs, chanted and offered speeches from the top of the state Capitol steps.
While it was ostensibly a protest for May Day, and some wore union garb, attendees held signs for a host of disparate causes. Some called for President Trump’s removal. Some had Ukrainian or rainbow flags. Others had slogans opposing Elon Musk or the U.S.’s role in the war in Gaza.

The rally was held by a local 50501 chapter, part of a loose coalition of grassroots organizers that’s been holding protests in capitals around the country since the beginning of Trump’s second term. 
And the nonuniformity was part of the design.
“It started off as a reason for everyone to scream,” TJ Demetriou, a 42-year-old from Hershey,  and one of the organizers, told the Capital-Star.
Demetriou, a veteran, said he had never been involved in protesting or politics before Trump’s latest term. But he was alarmed by what he saw. In particular, what he believes are “threats to the Constitution.” He cited attacks on free speech and the press, deportations without due process, and a consolidation of power in the executive branch.
But the protests, he said, were a way to unite people focused on different issues around their opposition to Trump, especially as many echoed the same criticism voiced at the Philadelphia event – Democrats weren’t doing enough.
“I thought we’d be putting up more of a fight. Not us, but Democrats in power,” said Nick Frey, a 26-year-old from Harrisburg.
Though he considers himself a “leftist” and not a Democrat, Frey voted for Harris in November. He sees the party as the most viable option at the moment.
Frey carried a sign that admonished Trump’s “brand of oligarchy.”
“He’s trying to create a tribute system with our allies, when he feels like they aren’t paying their fair share,” Frey said. “He’s ruined our good will built over the past 80 years since the end of World War II. And he’s done that in the first 100 days.”
Still, he said the most important issue for him at the moment is the Trump administration’s treatment of immigrants and minorities more broadly.

Carol Nodgaard, 66, came to the protest from Lancaster.
“I used to teach history and government,” she said. “I can’t control what necessarily goes on in Congress, but I can call, I can write and I can show out.”
Nodgaard said she lives off her social security benefits and 401k savings. But she’s worried that Trump’s aggressive cuts to the federal government may affect the social security program, and his tariff policies have hurt her investments.
“Hopefully it’ll come back up,” she said.
But Nodgaard said, as a gay person, the administration’s hostility towards transgender people has been particularly affecting. And being from a family of farmers in Nebraska, their treatment of immigrants has been hard to watch as well.
“Who’s working on the farms and the meat packing plants?” Nodgaard said. “They’re immigrants doing the work. But all their workers have disappeared because they’re afraid of being deported.”
Still, she’s heartened by the protest movement, which she thinks is stronger than it was in Trump’s first term. She’s been to multiple rallies since Trump took office in January.
“It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” she said.  She said she’ll be back in Harrisburg again Friday to see Sen. Sanders speak at the Farm Show Complex. 
Sanders will be in the capitol city on Friday and Bethlehem on Saturday for his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour.

One of those lessons occurred during a yellow fever outbreak in the summer of 1898 when a community of honest citizens in Orwood, then a hamlet in southwest Lafayette County, helped a team of physicians change the direction of public health for Mississippi and the rest of the country.
I first heard about their story listening to a documentary about yellow fever with my husband, a virologist, who teaches at the University of Mississippi. The video mentioned an unnamed doctor in Mississippi who had advanced a theory linking mosquitoes and yellow fever.
The story I uncovered models the honesty and trust in medical science we need today to keep our families and communities healthy.

Yellow fever was a problem in the South throughout the 1800s. Its initial symptoms — fever, body aches and severe headache — were followed by jaundice and in some cases internal bleeding leading to death. The jaundice left the skin tinged with yellow, thus the name “yellow fever.”

In early August 1898, a young woman named Sallie Wilson Gray (no relation to the author) developed chills and a fever while visiting at her uncle’s home in Taylor. Her uncle immediately sent her home to be cared for by her family in Orwood, about 10 miles away.  
Days later, Sallie’s uncle in Taylor died from what proved to be yellow fever. Family members wiped black vomit, a sign of internal bleeding, from his body as he lay in his coffin. 
Sallie had now brought the same illness home to Orwood. 
***
I learned about yellow fever in seventh grade when we studied the 1878 yellow fever epidemic, the worst to strike the Mississippi River Valley. That year, Mississippi reported almost 17,000 cases and more than 4,000 deaths. I didn’t realize, though, how yellow fever continued to appear year after year. 
Physicians had a basic understanding of bacteria after the Civil War, but they didn’t recognize viruses, which proved to be the cause of yellow fever, until later in the 1900s. One popular theory suggested yellow fever spread on fomites—inanimate surfaces—like bedding, clothing and furniture. Panic often followed news of a yellow fever outbreak. Health officials established quarantines, closed roads, river ports and train stations, hoping to curb the spread of infections. 
The fear of what was not known then about yellow fever reminded me of the early days of the COVID pandemic when fear spread through rumors and unconfirmed anecdotes on social media. 
***
Sallie’s sisters and brothers in Orwood soon developed the same symptoms as Sallie. By September, 30-plus people in Taylor and Orwood showed signs of the disease and new cases were reported outside the local area. In response, three interstate railroads shut down and Memphis halted train traffic coming into the city. In Starkville, the president of Mississippi A&M (now Mississippi State University) posted a column of guards along its roads. In mid-October, officials placed all of Mississippi under quarantine as thousands fled the state. 
Months earlier, the governor of Mississippi, recognizing the heavy toll yellow fever often brought to his state, had sent a team of Board of Health physicians to Cuba, the center for yellow fever research. There the group met with Dr. Walter Reed, the Army physician directing the American research interests on the island. Reed pursued a theory that mosquitos transmitted the disease, but his experiments to establish that link repeatedly failed. The Mississippi team, including Dr. Henry Gant, a Water Valley doctor, returned home, still hopeful that science could soon solve the yellow fever mystery.
Gant immediately responded when he learned about the outbreak in Taylor. So did Dr. Henry Rose Carter, a field epidemiologist who served as the quarantine officer at Ship Island and who investigated yellow fever outbreaks throughout the South. 
Committed to the same rigorous scientific process that epidemiologists use today, Carter looked for patterns in how diseases spread within clusters of people. With yellow fever, he needed to identify the first person to develop the disease in a specific area and then trace everybody and everything that the person came into contact with.  
Over and over again, unreliable sources or conflicting pieces of data prevented Carter from finding a pattern. People, suspicious of government intervention and scared of the consequences of yellow fever, often distorted the truth. 
Fortunately for us today, the people of Orwood proved to be different. The people, Carter wrote, were “honest enough to tell the truth” and cooperated with efforts to trace the infection of each case.
Working with Carter, Gant moved from house to house in Orwood, instructing families to quarantine at home, though their natural inclination was to care for their neighbors. He also questioned each person, recording data for Gant’s analysis. 
Unlike diseases that produce low-grade fevers, an abrupt and high fever often characterizes a case of yellow fever. For that reason, many of the people Gant interviewed reported the day their infections started and also the time their fevers ignited: Mr. G. W. McMillan, sickened on Aug. 29 at noon.  Mrs. Rogers, Sept. 4, 10:00 am. 
Collecting this detailed information about time proved essential for Carter’s study and he cheered Gant’s ability to gather such reliable data. “A greater tribute to the good faith of the community, or to its confidence in Dr. Gant, can scarcely be given,” he wrote. 
Studying the Orwood data, Carter recognized a consistent time interval between cases, about two weeks between the first case and the development of secondary cases. This meant that the infection did not immediately spread from person-to-person but required time to incubate. He called this the period of extrinsic incubation.
I’ve read Carter’s scientific report with the results of the Orwood study, the same report that persuaded Walter Reed to alter his experimental process. Waiting 10-14 days before introducing infected mosquitos to healthy volunteers, Reed successfully demonstrated the transmission of yellow fever from mosquito to human. 
With the development of mosquito control procedures, the fever soon vanished in the U.S. and Caribbean. Today a vaccine can protect those travelling or living where the disease remains a threat.
***
Sallie and her siblings were among the lucky, surviving their infections with only lingering weakness and fatigue. When frosts fell in north Mississippi in early November 1898, the number of fever cases quickly fell. In total, officials confirmed 2,478 cases across the state. Those who died totaled 114.
Reed later acknowledged that the “work in Mississippi did more to impress me with the importance of an intermediate host in yellow fever than everything else put together.”  
***
My husband and I drove from our home in Oxford to Taylor and then Orwood on a hot muggy day in August, probably experiencing the same weather conditions as Sallie. Orwood is a ghost town today, but we found the cemetery where Sallie’s uncle is buried, adjacent to the wood-planked Presbyterian Church that still stands. 
Walking those grounds emphasized for me what the neighbors who once lived in Orwood taught us. Honesty and rigorous scientific inquiry — and not political rhetoric or unproven claims — are the tools we must trust to combat disease and dispel fear.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s seafood industry, squeezed by depressed fish prices and increased costs, is in a crisis. Also in a crisis is the Alaska state budget, with both investment income and oil revenues in sharp decline.
That presents a dilemma for lawmakers trying to find ways to help the beleaguered seafood industry. What can they do to boost the industry’s fortunes at a time when they are staring down a big budget deficit?
Some bills are pending in the Legislature that aim to aid fishers, the industry and the communities that depend on seafood harvests. Those include bills responding directly to recommendations made by a legislative task force that worked for several months prior to the session’s start.
As to which bills are likely to pass this year and which might have to wait until 2026, one task force member had a succinct answer.
“The ones that don’t cost money,” Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, who is also a co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview last week. “This year is a very difficult year to have legislation that has expenditures with it.”
Task force bills working their way through the Legislature appear to fit Stedman’s description.
One bill that has already passed the House is aimed at providing fishers better access to insurance.
The House passed the measure, House Bill 116, on April 25. The Senate Labor and Commerce Committee has scheduled the bill for a hearing on May 9.
It would allow commercial fishers to establish their own insurance pools, providing a new option for harvesters coping with sharply rising insurance premiums. Three such pools already exist for Alaska fishing organizations, but they are managed in Washington state.
Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, said that bill may have the best chance of passing this session among all the pending seafood bills. 
The bill has an especially appealing feature, said Stutes, seafood industry task force member and chair of the House Fisheries Committee: It would impose no new costs on the state. “We’re having trouble paying our bills as it is now,” she said on Wednesday.
A second measure, House Bill 129, and its counterpart, Senate Bill 130, proposes to modify the state’s existing tax credit program aimed at promoting the development of fisheries products. The legislation would expand eligibility for the tax credits.
A problem raised by industry members during the task force meeting was what they considered to be an overly restrictive set of qualifications for the tax credits.
The credit program allows companies to offset state taxes with up to 50% of their total investments in equipment and property used to create value-added seafood products. As of now, the program is limited to equipment used on a single species from a limited set of specific types of fish: salmon, herring, pollock, sablefish and Pacific cod. The changes proposed in the bill would expand that eligibility to all types of seafood, including shellfish. Through that change, it would allow product development investment credits to be applied for purchases of equipment used on multiple fish species.
 

  Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, and Rep. Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, listen at a Nov. 13, 2024, hearing in Anchorage to testimony about problems facing the Alaska seafood industry. Stevens chairs the Joint Legislative Task Force Evaluating Alaska’s Seafood Industry, established earlier in the year, and Stutes and Edgmon are members. The task force made recommendations in a report issued at the start of this year’s legislative session, and several bills have resulted from those recommendations.

	The bill would add refrigeration and cooling systems to the list of equipment that qualifies for the investment credit. And it would extend the investment credit’s sunset date from Jan. 1, 2027, the current end date of the program, to Jan. 1, 2040.
Though it would not require direct spending from the state, the proposal is not without costs. According to the fiscal note prepared by the Department of Revenue, it would mean a loss in state revenues ranging from about $1 million in the coming year to over $4 million in 2030.
Both the House and Senate versions of the bill were pending in those bodies’ finance committees as of this week.
A bill aimed at helping fishing communities would increase cities’ or boroughs’ share of the fisheries tax revenues that are currently split between the state and local governments. The measure, Senate Bill 135, proposes replacing the current even split with varying percentages, up to 75% for local governments, depending on where fish are landed or processed. It also proposes a sliding scale for revenue sharing with newly created municipalities or boroughs.
The bill, currently pending in the Senate Finance Committee, is crafted with the purpose of helping communities maintain and repair harbors and other facilities needed by the seafood industry. While it would mean a reduction in state revenues in the short term, the bill could wind up generating more revenue for local and state government in the long term by improving infrastructure, supporters say.
“Acknowledging a more fair balance of sharing the fisheries tax revenue with the communities that most directly affect generating the fisheries tax revenue is in the interest of the State. By reinvesting tax revenue into local infrastructure, we can strengthen coastal economies, support the seafood industry, and promote long-term resilience,” the sponsor statement said.
A fourth bill would shore up the Alaska Commercial Fishing and Agriculture Bank, a member-owned cooperative that has lost business to the state-operated Commercial Fishing Revolving Loan Fund.
The bill seeks to “Help keep financing options open and available for Alaska’s businesses, Alaska small family businesses,” said Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, one of the task force members. Kiehl, speaking at Tuesday’s Senate majority caucus news conference, said Senate Bill 156, if passed, will help the Alaska Commercial Fishing and Agriculture Bank survive “and make sure that those who take a risk and go into business, on Alaska waters harvesting our seafood, have access to the capital they need so that more of the permits don’t migrate outside.”
Additional bills face opposition
Two other pending seafood bills, both introduced by Gov. Mike Dunleavy and not resulting from the seafood industry task force, face an uncertain future.
One measure, numbered House Bill 135 and Senate Bill 131, would expand the duties of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute to include mariculture products like oysters and kelp.
Although that idea was discussed in the task force meetings held in the months preceding the start of the legislative session, it was not among the recommendations in the group’s final report.
Many mariculture industry members oppose the idea, arguing that they prefer to manage their own marketing efforts and that they cannot spare the money to contribute to more generic ASMI campaigns.
Stutes said there seems to be a split in the industry, with kelp harvesters more positive about the idea and shellfish farmers more opposed. But as long as significant opposition exists, the state cannot move forward with the proposed expansion of ASMI’s duties, she said.
“We’ve got to have that come from the stakeholders rather than from us,” she said. “We’ll continue having a conversation, but I don’t see it going anywhere in the near future.”

	The other seafood bill introduced by the governor would allow finfish farming in the state, reversing a decades-old ban. The idea has been panned by fishers and by lawmakers representing fishing communities.
The House version, House Bill 111, got a single hearing in Stutes’ committee on April 10. The Senate version, Senate Bill 108, got a single hearing on March 10 in the Senate Resources Committee.
“It’s not going anywhere,” Stutes said. “We gave it a perfunctory hearing just so the administration could hear that Alaskans are not ready for this. “
Aside from the targeted seafood industry bills, lawmakers are seeking to increase ASMI’s funding. The pending budget includes a $10 million boost in funding, to be used over three years. The state agency relies on industry contributions as well as state appropriations to promote Alaska seafood in domestic and international markets.
Stutes said that even though Dunleavy vetoed last year’s lawmaker-approved $10 million injection into ASMI, she believes he will support this year’s funding increase.
“I think that the administration and the governor recognize how important it is,” she said. Dunleavy traveled in March to the Seafood Expo in Boston, she noted. “And I think that he really had an opportunity to recognize how important ASMI is and what they are able to do with the minimum amount of funding.”
Other seafood-producing nations spend much more on marketing than ASMI, she added.
The Legislature’s work on seafood comes at a time when Trump administration policies are anticipated to make the Alaska industry’s plight even worse.
Tariffs were repeatedly brought up as a concern at task force meetings, with virtually all of the comments expressing fears about impact to Alaska’s seafood industry, Stevens said at the news conference.
“It can be pretty horrendous,” he said.
About 70% of Alaska’s seafood is sent to other countries. China, the nation most pointedly targeted by the Trump tariffs, is the top export destination for Alaska seafood.
Stutes said she does not know of any tariff impacts that have hit the industry yet, but she is fully expecting them as fishing seasons get underway. “I cannot imagine that they’re going to get anything but worse, because we send a lot of H&G fish to China to be reprocessed,” she said, referring to the abbreviations for headed and gutted, the first step in processing.
Many companies’ business models are based on sending such fish to China, she said.
The Trump administration’s deep cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are also a big problem for the Alaska seafood industry, lawmakers said. NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service provides the information needed to know when fisheries should open and close, Stevens said. And NOAA’s National Weather Service provides information that fishers need to stay safe.
“Fishermen and processors are very concerned about where things are going,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DSC07883-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 15:12:12.501265

(Photo by Manuel Balce Ceneta-Pool/Getty Images)Countless elected officials in Colorado must consider themselves vulnerable to personal legal liability and even arrest, based on the Trump administration’s dramatic escalation this week of immigration enforcement tactics.
Administration officials have shown that there is no limit — and certainly no limit imposed by the Constitution — to the methods they’ll pursue to undertake mass deportations. Since almost the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second term, federal immigration authorities have acted with impatience or disregard for due process and court rulings. The most visible victims of this abuse of power have been immigrants, including some who were living in the U.S. legally but were deported anyway.
But now public officials are coming under attack, including leaders in elected office in Colorado, based on an executive order Trump signed Monday. The language in the executive order is wildly hostile. It frames the actions of targeted individual officials — not just jurisdictions — as crimes. Their efforts “often violate federal criminal laws, including those prohibiting obstruction of justice, harboring or hiring illegal aliens, conspiring against the United States, and impeding federal law enforcement.” One passage accuses some “state and local officials” of engaging in “a lawless insurrection” against the U.S. government.

That’s an exceedingly serious accusation.
Sarah Parady, an at-large member of the Denver City Council, presumably is in the ambit of the executive order. She also has an informed perspective on it, since she is a lawyer who has litigated constitutional matters and once clerked for a federal judge in the Denver-based 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Given the nature of the Trump administration, she had anticipated the kind of threats directed at officials like her that are contained in the order.
“I think weaponized prosecutions are just part of the authoritarian playbook. They always go in that direction, and they always use that against whomever their political enemies are, and that’s what this is about,” she said.
The development gives new urgency, in addition to the general emergency the MAGA agenda presents in the state, to resistance activities throughout Colorado, especially in cities like Denver that immigration extremists label a “sanctuary.”
The executive order directs Pam Bondi, Trump’s attorney general, and Kristi Noem, his secretary of Homeland Security, to publish a list of states and cities they determine are “sanctuary jurisdictions.” It is all but certain Denver will make the list, since the Trump administration has already singled it out for retribution. The administration has already yanked $24 million in grants for Denver over the city’s purported sanctuary policies. In March, Republicans hauled Denver Mayor Mike Johnston before a U.S. House Oversight Committee hearing to answer for what they claimed, largely through misinformation, were “obstructionist policies” around federal immigration enforcement. One of Colorado’s own Republican members of Congress, Gabe Evans has declared that “Denver and Colorado are sanctuary jurisdictions.”
Anti-immigration zealots view several Denver policies as providing improper assistance to immigrants — what local officials would characterize as commonsense, safety-promoting, humane measures — such as a 2017 ordinance that enacted restrictions on local cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
There’s every reason to take the executive order seriously. The administration has undertaken its immigration enforcement with evident contempt for constitutional limits, and its efforts have landed hundreds of people — who were afforded minimal or no due process, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents — in detention. Some ended up in a notoriously brutal prison in El Salvador, from which they might never be able to leave. Federal agents recently arrested a Wisconsin judge they claim obstructed immigration officials who wanted to detain a man in the judge’s courtroom.
An actual prosecution against an official like Parady or other Denver officeholders might be unlikely, because obstruction and other statutes the Trump administration suggests they’ve violated do not plausibly cover actions they’ve taken. To make an arrest, federal law enforcement officials would need to establish probable cause and obtain a warrant signed by a judge, Parady noted. That would constitute a strong check on abuse of the legal system.
But the threat of arrests does its own damage.
“It’s an effort to chill the speech and even the votes, or actions in the interest of our constituents, of elected leadership,” Parady said. “I can hardly imagine anything more dangerous to the politics of the country than trying to basically … terrorize your political opponents. But I am not terrorized by this.”
She added that Denver elected officials “just need to keep doing our jobs on behalf of the people that elected us.”
The executive order is not just an assault on public officials. More importantly, it’s an act of oppression against the people, including immigrant residents, of Denver and Colorado.
The laws of the city and state are the people’s laws, and public officials are the people’s representatives. Local statutes and ordinances were adopted according to the people’s will, and an authority that thwarts it through unconstitutional maneuvers amounts to a menace that is the people’s ultimate responsibility to defeat.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.


There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

One month since the Trump administration shut down a resilience funding program, communities dependent on the money for major infrastructure projects are still reeling.
The post Without FEMA resilience money, Mass. communities scramble to save flood prevention projects appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","WHEN THE AXE FELL on $882 million in federal funding aimed at helping communities prepare for future flooding, it came paired with a critique of the program’s very purpose. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program “was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” an unidentified FEMA spokesperson wrote in a press release on April 4. “It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.” Emily Granoff, Chelsea’s deputy director of housing community and development, was assisting another community with smaller scale grant work before the BRIC cuts were announced. Seeing the news, that community reached out to see if their funding was impacted, and Granoff assured them that it wasn’t.  But Chelsea and Everett had money on the line – a $120 million flood resilience project for the Island End River that included a storm surge barrier, storm surge control facility, and wetland restoration set to begin construction in 2026. “And I looked up the press release,” Granoff said. “And then I cried for a bit.” The local toll wouldn’t be felt fully for two weeks, when Massachusetts estimated that some $90 million in funding and potential grants would be pulled, almost $50 million of which was dedicated to the Chelsea and Everett endeavor. Overnight, project managers overseeing resilient park and stormwater flooding projects, updating drinking water and watershed regulations, and preparing for the best ways to hold rising waters at bay rushed to triage. Granoff was among them, as the project manager for Chelsea in a partnership with Everett. Roughly between and beneath the ground of the two Gateway Cities – historically industrial midsized urban centers – passes the Island End River. This tributary to the Mystic River generates dramatic flooding during serious coastal storms, sending feet of water rushing over the nearby roadways, commercial, and industrial sites. The risk of worsening storm surges is difficult to overstate, Granoff said as she walked the border of the proposed project site on an 80-degree April afternoon, bright sun bouncing off of gleaming high-tide waters and discarded glass and plastic bottles around the spot where the river dips into a massive culvert to pass beneath the city. An illustration of the how a storm tide interacts with a shore, from the Island End River project page.By 2081, the kind of 1-in-100-year storm surge events proportional to Hurricane Sandy could be annual occurrences, according to a 2022 study from the Woodwell Climate Research Center.  Within the 2070 flood risk zone sits Chelsea High School, a Market Basket, Route 1, Route 16, commuter rail and freight rail tracks, a Federal Bureau of Investigation building, and the New England Produce Center that distributes produce to 8 million people across the Northeast. “Basically 10 years ago, the cities of Everett and Chelsea were evaluating their flood vulnerability and found that Island End River was a huge one – not just for us, but for those 8 million people and for anyone who drives into Boston from the North Shore,” Granoff said. “Because all those roads are gonna get flooded out in a coastal storm rain. It’s not really feasible to move Route 1 or Route 16. It’s not feasible to move the New England Produce Center. So we just gotta protect it.” A view of expected flooding in Chelsea and Everett, with the proposed storm surge barrier outlined. Map courtesy City of Chelsea.When Chelsea and Everett were built out in the 18th and 19th centuries, wetlands became the site of a heavily industrial district full of critical infrastructure. Defending that infrastructure, planners determined over the past decade, will require a barrier to prevent water from coming up out of the culvert beneath the island and out of the river around the island and spilling into its old riverbed and marshland path.  Part of the solution is a 3,000 square-foot, $42 million underground storm surge control facility would sink 8 to ten feet below ground and rise 6 to 8 feet above ground next to the small M&T bank building near the outlets of the Market and Beacham Street culverts. Because the river passes physically beneath the area through the culvert, an above-ground storm barrier that stops water from washing over the land wouldn’t stop the surge from blasting through the large culvert tunnel and flooding out through storm drains. So, the control facility would manage the flow of water under Chelsea and Everett while the barrier keeps most of the water from flowing over the cities. The storm barrier would avoid crossing freight rail tracks in Everett, roughly following the path of existing fencing. (Photo by Jennifer Smith)Walking along the path of where the 4,460 linear-foot storm surge barrier – a wall occasionally broken up by gates to allow people and vehicles to pass though when the area isn’t flooding – would go involves weaving in and around city and private land. The path of the barrier has changed over the years, to accommodate issues like avoiding crossing rail tracks or making sure the water-dependent businesses along the port can access the water on which they depend.  On the Everett side, the barrier would wind around commercial sites to higher ground, ending roughly where 2070 estimates expect just a foot of flooding in intense storm events – annoying but manageable. On the Chelsea side, they plan to create a new high ground where the barrier can taper off behind a revamped riverwalk and restored salt marsh that are part of the 18,000 square feet of nature-based resilience improvements that include wetland upgrades. A boardwalk in Chelsea would be raised and upgraded alongside revived salt marsh, including the removal of tall invasive plants. (Photo by Jennifer Smith)The Island End River project was the largest chunk of the $90 million in Bay State BRIC cuts, but the impact sprawls from Eastern to Western Massachusetts.  “The Trump Administration has suddenly ripped the rug out from under cities and towns that had been promised funding to help them upgrade their roads, bridges, buildings and green spaces to mitigate risk and prevent disasters in the future,” Gov. Maura Healey said in April. “This makes our communities less safe and will increase costs for residents, municipalities and businesses.” In dramatically re-orienting the US federal agency responsible for coordinating the country’s disaster relief efforts, the Trump administration cancelled all BRIC applications from Fiscal Years 2020-2023, imperiling states from New England to the Gulf Coast. Any undistributed funds would be immediately returned either to the Disaster Relief Fund or the US Treasury, according to FEMA. Two major Boston resilience projects – Moakley Park in South Boston and Tenean Beach in Dorchester – are either having millions in funding pulled or grant applications cancelled. Funding for culvert projects in Acton, Brockton, Grafton, North Adams, and Taunton also got the axe.  More than two dozen Democratic congresspeople sent a letter to the acting FEMA administrator on April 23, urging the administration to reconsider the cuts.  “Ending the FEMA BRIC program is a terrible mistake and marks a huge setback for many climate-vulnerable cities and towns in my district,” wrote US Rep. Seth Moulton, who helmed the letter.  Newburyport mayor Sean Reardon noted that the town was expecting to receive a BRIC grant protect its watershed and drinking water supply, but “will now need to find other resources to do this important work.” An irony, project proponents point out, is slicing away BRIC funding in the interests of shrinking the budget could cut the other way. Projects must go through a cost-benefit analysis to compare the upsides of a resilience project to what it would cost to build. If disaster washes up to a municipality’s doors because of flooding, FEMA gets the call and bears the cost. At least, that’s how the system has worked for decades, but Trump in March signed an executive order directing state and local governments to “play a more active and significant role” in resilience and preparedness. The administration has since denied some federal funding to disaster-struck areas.  A project is considered cost-effective by FEMA when the ratio of future risk reduction benefits to its cost is 1 or greater. The Everett and Chelsea project’s ratio, which would include over $3.6 billion in protection of high-risk assets according to filings, is more than 38.  But without the FEMA funding, the math looks bleak.  Along with the $50 million BRIC funding, the cities expected to contribute $10 million in combined local funds. Planners have been working with the state to secure $45 million in funding and seeking the remaining $14.8 million through additional state and private foundation grants. “We’ve had warning signs and storms where we’ve seen how disruptive it can be to have even a foot or two of flooding,” Granoff said, standing alongside a main drag that sees a thousand trucks a day roll through with produce and other goods, just a two minute walk from the culvert.  “And that was one of the great things about this project, was that we were gonna prevent it from ever happening. We saw a risk, and we all agreed it was a risk, and we were gonna say we can fix this.” They are looking at whether it would be possible to break the project into pieces, but Chelsea and Everett are communities with a higher proportion of low-income residents, without the budget for projects of this scale.  “Municipalities aren’t built to do this kind of huge infrastructure project,” Granoff said. “But even with all that, we were gonna do it. We’ll still have to do it.” The post Without FEMA resilience money, Mass. communities scramble to save flood prevention projects appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0805-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 10:07:33.454458

The post Massachusetts has a literacy problem. We ignore it at our peril. appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE LATEST RESULTS of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, known as the “nation’s report card,” on our students’ achievement in reading and math were sobering, but not surprising. We are being heralded by Massachusetts education policymakers for being #1 in the nation in terms of academic achievement. But Massachusetts also holds the cringeworthy distinction of having the second largest achievement gap between rich and poor students, a gap that has widened since 2019. In spite of 30 years of reform efforts and tens of billions of dollars in increased spending, we are still only “#1 for some.” Six out of every ten children in Massachusetts cannot read or do math at grade level. Eight out of ten low-income, Black and Latino children are not performing at grade level, leaving our state as a national leader in producing reading gaps for our Black and Hispanic students. Only half of white children are proficient. Needless to say, we should not be proud of our performance. Parents should be outraged, but recent surveys conducted by the MassINC Polling Group indicate that they are generally satisfied with their children’s education. It will take bold leadership at the state and local levels to expose our accelerating achievement gaps and build support for changing literacy instruction to improve outcomes for the students who need it most. (MassInc Polling Group is partly owned by MassINC, the publisher of CommonWealth Beacon.) Massachusetts is one of only 10 states that does not mandate evidence-based reading practices in schools. Additionally, the Commonwealth’s teacher prep programs are not preparing our new teachers with the skills to teach reading effectively. Almost 70% of the state’s higher education preparation programs are teaching practices that run counter to the research about what works best for students. It is as though an alarm keeps ringing, yet we keep hitting snooze. As the ringing gets louder, the stakes get higher, and still our children wait for the adults in our state to wake up and act. Not learning how to read has lifelong consequences. Students who are not reading at grade level by the time they reach fourth grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school which in turn leads to additional challenges for them as adults: lower lifetime earnings, higher rates of unemployment, and a higher likelihood of entering the criminal justice system. The impact of low literacy rates in our state will have sweeping economic and social consequences.  Massachusetts is being outpaced by Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee — states that have mandated curriculum changes as a requisite for additional funding. These states are seeing a rebound in literacy scores, while Massachusetts students are falling further behind. Since 2013, we have seen a 71% increase in education spending to an average of $24,900 per student. Yet our children’s reading scores are significantly lower. If what we are buying isn’t working, shouldn’t we shift this investment to a proven method of teaching literacy? Legislation recently filed (SD.1761 / HD.2329) — the “Right to Read Act” filed by Assistant Senate Majority Leader Sen. Sal DiDomenico (D-Everett), Rep. Danillo Sena (D-Acton), and Rep. Simon Cataldo (D-Concord) — would create a comprehensive framework for early literacy instruction, as well as implement the best, evidence-based solutions to improve children’s reading levels. This would be done via providing pre-service training and professional development, offering assessment and parental notification, improving instruction and curriculum, and instituting tiered in-class and out-of-class intervention. It would also better support teachers’ capacity from teacher preparation to when they become solely responsible for their own classrooms, require high-quality curriculum materials aligned with the best science, and mandate support for students with dyslexia and multilingual students.  Governor Healey’s FY26 budget includes increased funding ($25M) for her Literacy Launch initiative, a multi-year program that provides districts with funding for high-quality, evidence-based reading instruction through literacy materials, technical support, coaching and professional development for educators. The Governor is also requesting funding ($25M) for high-dosage tutoring to build students’ early literacy skills. Parents support science-based reading instruction — 8 out of 10 parents believe Massachusetts schools should be required to use evidence-based reading curricula. Our coalition includes parents, former teachers, researchers and advocates across our Commonwealth. Our children attend our public schools. We care deeply about our state. It’s time to awaken from our slumber and act with urgency to improve reading results.  Our children’s future depends on us.  The Mass Reads Coalition is a group of educators, parents, literacy experts, and policy advocates that supports “Right to Read” legislation that would require school districts to use “evidence based” literacy curricula.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Government cost-cutting led by billionaire Elon Musk spurred a 2022 Democratic U.S. Senate candidate to jump back into the electoral arena.
Brian Bengs announced this week that he plans to run in the 2026 election, this time as an independent, for the seat held by Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds. Sioux Falls businessman Julian Beaudion is seeking the Democratic nomination.
Bengs said his previous run as a Democrat was out of character.
“The bulk of my life I’ve been an independent,” Bengs told South Dakota Searchlight, noting that he only registered as a Democrat in 2022 to earn the organizational and fundraising advantage of party alignment. 
Bengs came in second in the three-way race for U.S. Senate that year. Republican Sen. John Thune, who’s since become majority leader, got 70% of the vote, Bengs collected 26%, and Libertarian Tamara Lesnar pulled 4%.
There had been “people telling me to run” against Rounds in 2026 for quite a while, Bengs said, but “a switched flipped” when Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) came for his job.
Sioux Falls business owner and former state trooper announces Democratic bid for U.S. Senate

The former Northern State University professor and retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel had moved to Hot Springs and taken a “retirement job” as a ranger at Wind Cave National Park. 
In February, DOGE fired “probationary” federal employees – those who hadn’t been on the job at least a year. Court orders later reinstated those employees, though most wound up on administrative leave, not back at work.
Bengs didn’t actually lose his job in the shake-up. No one at Wind Cave did.
“We learned that they had decided they weren’t going to fire veterans,” Bengs said. “I and everybody else were veterans, so we were only spared by virtue of having been in the military.”
That was enough to put Bengs back into political mode. He resigned his position at Wind Cave as of this month.
Bengs told Searchlight he didn’t want to run as a Democrat in 2022, but that “I didn’t have the money to run as an independent.” The party infrastructure opened doors to financing (Bengs ultimately raised about half a million dollars for his 2022 campaign), but it also gave him name recognition and helped him collect a list of potential donors that “wasn’t huge, but it was something.”
“Partisanship is an addictive drug, and it’s a drug we’ve mainlined into our homes,” Bengs said, referencing political media streams. “We get it on a daily basis.”
The small list of donors he collected through his momentary wade through Democratic waters has since grown to a “multi-million” name list, Bengs said Thursday. That’s the list upon which he intends to finance his run this time around.
“If everybody on that list donates even a few dollars, then we’re in the race,” Bengs said.
If elected, Bengs said he wouldn’t caucus with Democrats or Republicans. He’d act as kingmaker, he said, by courting whatever side had a proposal aligning with his values.
“When it’s a closely divided Senate and they want my vote, I’m going to say ‘what’s in it for South Dakota?’” Bengs said.
East River South Dakotans vent, call for action at Sioux Falls political town hall

That would be part of his pitch to the Republicans and independents who might be wary of casting a ballot for a former Democrat. He’d also point out positions like his belief that it’s time to end birthright citizenship. For those on the political left, he’d lean into support for a tax system that “favors work over wealth,” and his disgust with what he sees as the South Dakota delegation’s capitulation to President Donald Trump.
Bengs’ decision to run as an independent strikes Beaudion as opportunistic and as a telling sign. He supported Bengs in 2022 and said the two agree on some issues, but “I always have understood who I am and what I stand for,” Beaudion said.
“My campaign is for the people, and we believe the Democratic Party gives us the best chance to lead people in that way,” Beaudion said. “There has been much more of a steady hand in the Democratic Party.”
Bengs and Beaudion did speak about their respective electoral plans, with Bengs telling Beaudion he didn’t plan to run. That was before DOGE began targeting federal employees, though. 
Both men will appear over the weekend at the Custer County Democratic Party’s $50-per-ticket McGovern Day Rally at Crazy Horse Memorial, as will District 32 state Rep. Nicole Uhre-Balk, D-Rapid City.
Sen. Rounds, in a statement from his campaign staff, responded to Bengs’ announcement by calling him another choice for left-leaning South Dakotans.
“It’s great that the left wing of the Democrat Party will have multiple candidates to choose from,” the statement said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)In a disaster, service dogs are assigned to search for victims and comfort them. A new bill passed Monday by the Alaska House of Representatives intends to assist those dogs when it’s their turn to need help.
If approved by the Senate and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, House Bill 70 would allow ambulance crews to aid injured these dogs in a crisis and while they’re being transported to a veterinarian.
The aid would be limited to dogs used by law enforcement and those working search and rescue cases. In cases where both people and dogs are injured, the bill requires people to be helped first.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, explained on the House floor that under current law, paramedics and emergency medical technicians are legally forbidden from helping animals while on the job because doing so would be considered veterinary care, which is regulated by law.
An ordinary Alaskan could legally help an injured dog, Schrage explained, but not a trained medical professional.
“These are working dogs that go through serious risk to their safety in order to serve us, to help us be more safe, to be rescued in an emergency, and to be able to provide emergency care on scene, I think, would be an incredible thing,” Schrage said.
The bill was inspired by the death of Alaska State Trooper canine Rico, who was shot and killed during a 2017 police chase in Wasilla.
The House approved HB 70 on a 32-8 vote, with opposition coming from some legislators who cited concerns from veterinarians.
Rep. Rebecca Schwanke, R-Glennallen, said her vote against the bill was for that reason.
“We heard tremendous opposition to this bill by veterinary professionals across our state, largely because it does offer EMS personnel the opportunity to practice emergency veterinary care without proper training,” she said.
House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, referred to his decades of experience as a police officer and said he supported the bill.
“You want the person who is closest to the scene and best able to help save that animal — if the animal is shot or otherwise critically injured — to have a fighting chance,” he said. “These dogs have over $50,000 invested in just the purchase and training of the animal, and hundreds of thousands of dollars to continue to train with the canine officers. They are worth it.”

Since 2021, more than a dozen states have explicitly banned a decades-old literacy teaching method, known as “three-cueing,” that encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints (Michael Loccisano/Getty Images).As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Bills prohibiting a three-cueing system model of reading instruction have been introduced in Missouri but haven’t gotten much traction. The idea was added to a sweeping education bill focused on open enrollment, but that bill stalled in the Missouri Senate.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
 ‘It’s the system that needs fixing’

Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version focused on the science of reading passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill into law Monday to outlaw three-cueing.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Sen. Kemp’s bill requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
 Opposition to ‘science of reading’

Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.
In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

California is home to roughly 187,000 unhoused people. But for every homeless resident, there may be a concerned parent, sibling or offspring wondering where their loved one is, whether they’re in danger and how they’re getting along living on the streets.
Two concerned relatives saw their loved ones quoted in an October CalMatters article and reached out to our own Marisa Kendall for more information. Her story details how they were able to reunite with their relatives in Oakland.
Proponents of reuniting unhoused people with their friends or family say that while reunification does not always lead to someone becoming housed, it does have the potential to save lives when done with the proper support. 
A small number of organizations offer reunification services, such as the San Francisco-based nonprofit Miracle Messages, which helps unhoused clients look for relatives. It also assists people track down homeless family members, and since 2017, the nonprofit has arranged more than 115 of these kinds of reunions. LifeMoves, another nonprofit, also offers reunification services across 17 of its Silicon Valley homeless shelters.
Ashanti Terrell’s father has had a long history of being homeless throughout most of her childhood. Last fall Terrell received a call from a social worker informing her that her father, Ashby Dancy, was in a Texas hospital after trying to make his way to Atlanta, where she was living at the time, to visit her. But after Terrell made early arrangements and called the hospital back, Dancy was gone and no one knew where he went.
Terrell packed up her belongings in Atlanta and moved to the Bay Area to find her father. While looking him up on Google, she came across his name in CalMatters’ story about homeless voting.
Terrell found and began meeting with Dancy after that, checking in on him and offering food during her visits. In April she brought her 7-year-old son along so he could meet his grandfather for the first time.

Terrell, to her father during their meeting: “I just wanted to let you know that I’m here. As soon as I get myself together, I’m going to help you out.”

Feds freeze green money

As part of President Donald Trump’s objective to take back $20 billion in climate and green energy funding, the administration has frozen $250 million in grants to a nonprofit that helps furnish electric trucks at two major Southern California ports, writes CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.
Under former President Joe Biden, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awarded grants to nonprofits, banks and other groups. That included $250 million to Climate United, which offers affordable leases for electric trucks to small fleets and individual truckers serving the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports. For years, communities living near the ports face noxious fumes from trucks traveling through the ports.
But that money, which would have funded about 500 electric trucks, has been frozen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In March Lee Zeldin, the agency’s administrator, said the green energy grant program was “riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending.”
Climate groups have sued over the frozen cash, arguing that the federal agency and the bank that holds the money, Citibank, are illegally withholding money Congress had already appropriated.

You’re not the only one fighting against your HOA


Assemblymember Joe Patterson speaks during a press conference at the state Capitol in Sacramento on Dec. 5, 2022. Photo by Rahul Lal, CalMatters




For two Republican state lawmakers, the battle against homeowners associations isn’t over. 
Last week a bill that would have required California’s roughly 50,000 private homeowners associations, or HOAs, to be more transparent with their decisions and meeting agendas failed its first committee hearing.
The bill was authored by GOP Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego, but due to a scheduling conflict with a radio-hosting gig, his colleague Assemblymember Joe Patterson of Rocklin presented the measure at the hearing.
Patterson has gripes with his own HOA: He said his HOA demanded he add more landscaping bark around his home, which he did, and that his HOA sent notice that it disapproved of his son’s basketball hoop. Patterson said the “sheer harassment” he receives from his HOA is why he has a large black flag in his legislative office that reads “Defund the HOA.”
Four other Democratic lawmakers voted with Patterson to advance the bill, including the committee’s chairperson, but that wasn’t enough to pass. DeMaio said he would support Patterson’s plan to reintroduce the bill next year.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Tunde Salaam, in his fifth year of an apprenticeship with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 24, came out to Camden Yards Thursday evening to march for worker justice and against what he sees as the Trump administration’s anti-union policies.
“Worker rights, union rights are under attack,” said Salaam, 34, who said he came to the May Day march “to support my fellow workers” who he said have been hammered by decades of stagnant wages and offshoring of jobs.
But the march that brought hundreds to the stadium was just one of several “feeder marches” that started in different parts of Baltimore and all converged at the Inner Harbor for a citywide rally in recognition the May Day protests. Others marched for schools, for immigrant justice, for Palestine, but they all came together at the Inner Harbor under one premise: To oppose the Trump administration and “stop the billionaire takeover.”
More than 1,000 people gathered at the Baltimore rally, waving protest signs, singing and chanting their opposition to President Donald Trump (R) and billionaire Tesla owner Elon Musk, whose Department of Goverment Efficiency (DOGE) Service has careened through the federal government, slashing jobs and shuttering agencies.
The gathering in Baltimore was one of more than 1,000 May Day rallies that organizers said were scheduled across the country Thursday.
“The public is mad,” said Beverly Clevidence, 77, who said she only started joining political demonstrations months ago. “We’re banding together about many things – about labor, about civic services, about education.”

Other than some angry comments from drivers passing by, there weren’t any notable counterprotests around the gathering. Meanwhile, there was plenty of honking  and shouting from drivers in support of the protest.
Many of the grievances at the May Day rally were related to the Trump administration’s rapid cuts to funding and programs in an effort to reduce federal spending.
Cristina Duncan Evans, the Teacher Chapter Chair of the Baltimore Teachers Union, said that federal cuts to education and various policy changes are creating a difficult learning environment for kids.
“We’re seeing cuts from the federal government, we’re seeing ongoing issues in the school district, and we’re here showing up to show the strength of unions, the strength of educators and to connect with all of the other issues that people are bringing,” said Duncan Evans, who previously worked as a social studies teacher and a library media specialist.
“We’ve also seen a radical redefinition of civil rights that is an attack on African American students … and an attack on transgender students,” she said, “and we’re standing up for all of our students, all of our families and all of our staff.”
Many of the protesters where angry at the administration’s crackdown on undocumented residents. Kathleen Carlson, 31, an immigration lawyer, was at the protest to stand up for her clients who are “terrified” of Trump’s aggressive immigration policies.
“We’re all workers, and a large number of immigrants provide labor — provide poorly-paid labor, unpaid labor — and they get taken advantage of by corporations and individuals,” she said. “They deserve the same rights as every other citizen.”
Angela Clark, 26, with a youth-led climate activist group, the Sunrise Movement, said that the theme of the rally was “the workers versus the billionaire class.”
“‘Big Oil and Big Pharma, the people ruining the environment, are part of that billionaire class,” Clark said. “Our messaging right now is not necessarily ‘end climate change,’ it’s ‘stop billionaires from ruining our climate.’”

Some of the nonworker-focused protest signs demanded protections for transgender kids and adults, urged the administration to return erroneously deported Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and pushed for protecting Palestinian lives amid the Israel-Hamas war.
“The crowd is huge,” Clark said. “I think it’s great that we started with six different marches, all with different causes. And we’re all congregating here with one real unified message: Stop the billionaire class from messing everything up for us.”

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
A Michigan program that deploys reading and math tutors to schools to help struggling students faces an uncertain future because of Trump administration cuts.
Holly Windram, the executive director of the Michigan Education Corps, said she learned Friday that the federal Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, had terminated funding for AmeriCorps, a government agency focused on national service and volunteerism.
That affects the Michigan Education Corps work because it is part of AmeriCorps.
The immediate impact came this week with a stop-work order from the Michigan Community Service Commission, the administrative agent for the AmeriCorps program in Michigan. And it means funding for the 2025-26 school year that had been included in the continuing budget resolution Congress passed in March has also been terminated.
The cuts don’t just affect education programs like the academic intervention provided by the Michigan Education Corps. AmeriCorps programs also affect disaster response, public health, economic opportunity, environmental stewardship, and other areas. Those programs also face an uncertain future.
“This is an urgent situation,” Windram said of the wide scope of the cuts. “This is an absolute disaster for our communities.”
The cuts have the potential to upend efforts to improve student achievement across the nation. Many districts had used federal pandemic relief money to provide tutoring in an attempt to help students recover from the public health crisis. But that money has dried up and the AmeriCorps volunteers have helped maintain that work in many schools.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel earlier this week joined with 22 other attorneys general as well as two states in filing a lawsuit challenging Trump administration’s termination of the grants and staffing cuts to the agency.
“The President and his administration’s ongoing disregard for the rule of law is once again on full display in their attempt to dismantle AmeriCorps,” Nessel said in a statement earlier this week. “By canceling grants and slashing AmeriCorps’ workforce, the administration is illegally undercutting a Congressionally established and funded independent agency, while harming communities across Michigan.”
Despite the stop-work order, the Michigan Education Corps has enough money to continue paying tutors through the end of the current school year.
“The question mark is next program year,” Windram said.
This uncertainty was unexpected for Windram. When Chalkbeat first talked to her about potential federal funding cuts on April 17, DOGE had already cut a significant portion of the AmeriCorps staff but Windram was optimistic because the budget resolution had kept the funding for the next school year. Now she has to step up efforts to seek additional funding.
Windram has worked to diversify the program’s funding, and currently federal funding covers about 20% of the cost. She’ll now need to find sources of funding that can cover what will be lost if the federal funding cuts stand.
There is much at stake. The program serves 3,740 students from age 3 through grade 8 (the agency includes an early childhood component). Data shows that 75% of them meet or exceed their academic growth target. Windram said that’s important because the program isn’t just seeking to demonstrate growth with students, but instead seeking to have them close achievement gaps.
At Ralph J. Bunche Elementary School in Ecorse, a wall of fame in a hallway features students who were placed in the reading intervention program and have improved enough to no longer need the help. The smiling students are photographed holding their certificates, some posing with their tutors. The wall is a symbol of the impact of the work that happens when the tutors meet one-on-one with the struggling students.
When Chalkbeat visited Ralph J. Bunche Elementary School in Ecorse on April 4, there was already concern about whether the reading and math tutors would be able to continue beyond the current school year.
“That is very worrisome,” said Sandra Fuoco, the school’s Title I teacher, whose position is funded by federal money. “I have my interventionist wondering what’s going to happen? Do they look for a new job over the summer? They want to come back. They’re wonderful, wonderful workers, and we don’t want to lose them.”
The AmeriCorps cuts are happening as uncertainty swirls about potential federal education funding cuts that could affect everything from school meals for students to early childhood programs. Fuoco and Bunche Principal Toyre Burks worry that politicians and policymakers proposing such cuts don’t understand how much cuts could affect students.
“I have my concerns around us being able to meet our kids where they’re where they’re at,” Burks said. “We’re in an at-risk district. Our kids, they need the breakfast, lunch, sometimes even dinner and snacks that we’re giving them.”

(Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)President Donald Trump Thursday congratulated more than 200 graduates at a commencement ceremony at the University of Alabama for their academic accomplishments, and himself for his first 100 days in office for his second term.
In a meandering, hour-long address that drew a nearby protest, Trump called Alabama a “winner” and urged graduates to lead successful lives.
“Today, I am also asking you to look forward to, really, something very, very bright, more promising,” Trump said. “And it is going to be even more promising tomorrow, I promise you that. You are the first graduating class of the golden age of America.”
The president also praised himself for his controversial executive orders and rehashed his grievances with his critics and the Biden administration.
“In a matter of weeks, we achieved the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded,” Trump said to the applause of the crowd. “We have seen hundreds of thousands of people pouring into our country from prisons, from mental institutions, gangs, and all over the world, not just in South America.”
According to Axios, the decline in border crossings began under the Biden administration and was due in part to actions taken by the government of Mexico. Experts also say that border crossings can fluctuate. Trump’s actions have also led to the wrongful arrest of several people with legal status, including Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia and three U.S. citizen children under the age of 10, including one with Stage 4 cancer.
Much of the evening’s speech focused on imparting words of wisdom for the graduates using a list of virtues they should incorporate into their lives.

“In America, with drive and ambition, young people can do anything,” Trump said. The president, who became president of a real estate company his father Fred built, spoke about how he developed a property in Manhattan when he was in his 20s. Trump then praised Steve Jobs and Walt Disney for their accomplishments founding companies.
“If you are going to do something, you might as well think big because it is just as tough,” he said. “I know a lot of people, they thought small, and they are very smart. I know others who were not very smart, but they thought about the big picture.”
Throughout the address, Trump would shift quickly from advice to graduates to monologues on social issues. He repeatedly raised transgender issues, returning multiple times to what he characterized as the problem of males who transitioned into females and playing on female sports teams.
He would end his speech by heaping praise on Alabama for more than five minutes.
“You continue the legacy of Alabama legends who blazed the trails, won the games, tilled the fields, forged the steels, built the ships, and gave us the victories that built the American and changed the world.”
He praised the car racing in Talladega and highlighted the rockets developed in the state.
“This is the state that gave us nothing but victory,” Trump said. “The state with some of the greatest heroes in history, like Willie Mays, Jesse Owens, Joe Louis, your coach Nick Saban.”

A protest of Trump’s appearance organized by the University of Alabama’s College Democrats drew over 100 people.
“We deserve somebody who works for the people, by the people. And right now we have someone who is working for billionaires, by billionaires,” said Kyla Chatmon, a junior political science and African American studies double major at The University of Alabama. “And I think that is just unjust. And so I came out today to show my support to all the graduates who are having to have their graduation overshadowed by an authoritarian, fascist, dictator.”
Mary Maxwell, who also attended the event, said she feels like the university might have been scared to say no to the sitting president.
“It is a red state and people are afraid of him,” she said. “They’re afraid he’ll cut their funding and he’ll try to control what’s being taught at the school. I taught at the university for 20 years and did research for 15 [years]. He’s against education. He’s against science. He’s against people knowing more than him.”
Former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama and Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who ran for governor and U.S. Senator in Texas, spoke at the event.
“He wants us to feel hopeless. He wants us to feel like he has all the power. And let me tell you something. In this country, in this great democracy, in this government of, by and for the people, the real power is with us,” O’Rourke said during his speech.
O’Rourke encouraged protest attendees to keep fighting against the administration’s policies during his speech as well, invoking Bloody Tuesday, an attack on civil rights protestors by police and a white mob in Tuscaloosa in 1964, and Bloody Sunday, an attack on civil rights protestors crossing Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965.
“We can overcome these challenges, because we have overcome them before against much greater odds,” he said to the crowd.
Former Senator Doug Jones said during his speech that the gathering was “not a protest, this is a movement.”
“It is movements that changed this country,” he said. “Whether it was the Civil Rights Movement, whether it was the anti-war movement, it is the movements. And guess what? It started on college campuses.”

Jones also encouraged protest participants to write to their U.S. Senators as a form of speaking up and out for what they want.
“Write your U.S. Senators, they’ll ignore it, but write them anyway! Because those things mean something. As someone who sat in the halls of the United States Senate, we tried to answer everything, even people that came in that opposed what we were doing,” Jones said.
Jones also encouraged attendees to get involved with civic engagement to fight for the change they would like to see.
“Go to your county commission, go to your city council offices. Get engaged, civic engagement at the local level is where we have to be, that’s the power. You have that power,” he said.

A Republican bill to require more transparency from California’s 50,000 homeowners associations failed to advance out of committee despite bipartisan support.


Republican Assemblymember Joe Patterson says a woman slowly drives by his Placer County home about once a week and takes pictures.
She’s not an angry constituent or a stalker. He said she’s a representative from his homeowners’ association gathering evidence to make sure the exterior of Patterson’s home complies with its strict rules.“I’ve been getting letters for, you know, ‘Oh, your (landscaping) bark isn’t deep enough,’ ” he said. “Now it’s my son’s basketball hoop.”The “sheer harassment” from his HOA is why he said he has a large black flag in his legislative office. It reads: “Defund the HOA.”
So it didn’t take a lot of arm twisting from Patterson’s Republican colleague, Carl DeMaio, to persuade Patterson to present DeMaio’s Assembly Bill 21. The proposed new law would force California’s estimated 50,000 private homeowners’ associations to behave more like local governments when it comes to open records and public meetings. The bill failed to advance from its first committee hearing last week.
HOAs collect monthly fees from homeowners for services such as maintaining clubhouses and pools, security, plowing snow, landscaping, road repairs and other shared amenities. They often set neighborhood rules to ensure properties are maintained and don’t become unsightly.
Many people who live in HOA-governed communities have no complaints, appreciate that they help share the cost and believe that standard rules about home appearance prevent eyesores. 
But the associations themselves can sometimes devolve into bitter feuds between neighbors, featuring accusations of cronyism and ruthless enforcement of petty violations of an HOA’s rules. Multiple popular social media accounts and message boards are devoted to people sharing contempt for their HOAs. 
Patterson said his HOA demanded he add more landscaping bark around his home, which he did. As for his son’s basketball hoop, it’s one of those with wheels on it. That, according to his HOA, is a no-no, he said. Representatives for Patterson’s HOA, the Whitney Ranch Community Association in Rocklin, declined an interview request.

The failed measure would have required HOAs to abide by various rules similar to those city and county boards have to follow. That would have included making it mandatory for an HOA board to make decisions in recorded open meetings and adding mandatory disclosure requirements for records such as meeting agendas and minutes and notices of lawsuits. HOA members could sue to void decisions that violated the law.
“It brings sunlight to HOA governance,” Patterson told the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee. “This isn’t a crazy, radical proposal. It’s about ensuring that the people who live in these communities have the right to know what decisions are made on their behalf.”

Attempt to rein in HOAs may return
The bill failed last week with four Democrats on the committee voting for it, along with Patterson. A bipartisan group of seven lawmakers voted “no” or didn’t vote at all, which counts the same as a no vote. 
The lawmakers who voted “no” or who didn’t vote did not explain their rationale during the nine minutes the bill was discussed.
According to the Digital Democracy database, the bill’s opponents included the California Association of Community Managers, the Inner City Law Center, the San Diego Housing Commission and the Community Associations Institute, which advocates on behalf of HOAs.
The institute’s lobbyist, Taylor Triffo, told the committee that existing laws already provide accountability and transparency. 
The committee’s Democratic chairperson, Matt Haney of San Francisco, voted for the proposal, but it wasn’t enough to keep it alive.
Patterson said he thinks the bill largely died because of its author: DeMaio. He’s a conservative firebrand and San Diego talk radio host with a brash, Donald Trump-esque, “own-the-libs” style. 
“Honestly, it was Carl’s bill, and it going down in flames had nothing to do with the policy,” Patterson said. “I think if that was Joe Patterson’s bill, it would have had a different fate.”
DeMaio agreed that his name was probably its kiss of death.
“It probably has a lot more to do with the Democrats’ pettiness of just trying to kill any bill associated with me,” DeMaio said. He was unable to present his bill due to a conflict that arose from a radio-hosting gig, he said.
The two Democratic lawmakers who voted “no” on the bill, Alex Lee of Milpitas and Robert Garcia of Rancho Cucamonga, couldn’t be reached for comment Thursday.

DeMaio owns two properties that are in HOAs. He said those paying into the associations deserve transparency from what he describes as “quasi-governmental entities.” That’s why he said he wanted to add new requirements despite normally having a distaste for more regulation of private property. “If they can tax you, if they can encumber your property rights, they’re governmental decisions,” DeMaio said. “And so they should be subjected to the open meetings and public records laws like any other public entity.”
DeMaio said he would support Patterson’s plan to reintroduce the measure next year to give the bill a better shot. Patterson said he’s already gotten interest from Democratic colleagues wanting to sign on to give the bill a bipartisan boost. He declined to name them. 
Patterson said his homeowners association doesn’t charge that much – only $85 a month. But given that there are 2,800 homeowners paying the fee, that’s a significant amount of money for which the HOA board is responsible. Plus, he said if he doesn’t pay to protest the alleged “harassment” or for other reasons, the HOA can put a lien on his house.
“If you’re going to take my house from me and have a recorded lien on my home, then you damn well better provide very transparent financial records to your community,” he said.

How Gavin Newsom is balancing the fight against Trump with Los Angeles fire relief

,California,2025-05-02 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s homebuyer lotto was hardly a ‘Dream for All’. That doesn’t mean it should end,Denise Amos,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/dream-for-all-down-payment/,California needs to expand its down payment loan program to keep young families from moving out of the state. Yet there's no new money budgeted.,"Affording a home is no easy feat in California, where houses cost twice the national average. And for a lucky few, a state program aiming to help first-time homebuyers has reduced this American rite to a matter of winning a lottery.
About 18,000 people last year applied for California Dream for All, a state-funded loan that pays all or most of a down payment on a home. Borrowers pay it back when they sell.
Only about 2,000 families won the loans last year, averaging $117,000 each, and about 2,100 got them the year before. The 2-year-old program is costing taxpayers more than $500 million. 
The very existence of a down payment assistance program is a symbol of California’s failure to preserve economic mobility for younger generations. It begs the question: Is this a worthwhile way to help more Californians buy a home?
Gov. Gavin Newsom didn’t include any new funding for the loans in his initial state budget proposal in January. And lawmakers just gutted a bill that would have paid for Dream for All with a new tax on vacant commercial properties. Several dozen business and real estate groups slammed the new tax idea.
If state leaders and even real estate interests won’t prioritize the down payment program, it’s fair to question whether more tax dollars should be used. But once you consider the consequences,  the state must remain in the business of encouraging homeownership, especially if it helps retain California’s cost-burdened middle class.
Homeownership is still one of the best vehicles for narrowing the wealth gap between demographic groups, while stabilizing neighborhoods. And it could temper the growing divide between the very rich and the rest of us, while stemming the flood of people leaving California for more affordable housing elsewhere, which is endangering the state’s long-term outlook.
Today only 15% of California families can afford a median-priced home, which was $884,000 in March. Only 24% can manage a median-priced condo or townhome at $680,000. 
Paychecks just aren’t keeping up. Since 2014, the state has lost more than 700,000 adults who specifically cited housing as the primary reason. Half bought homes in their new state. 
California can’t afford to lose so many young families. With them goes a future tax base, as well as potential businesses, productivity and innovation. And schools lose because they are funded by the number of students in seats.
A shrinking population also means fewer Congressional seats. California lost a seat after the 2020 census; think tanks predict it’ll lose four or five more after the next one if trends continue.
Dream for All initially wooed first-time buyers in the middle who make up to 150% of the median income of their county. In Sacramento County, that means about $170,850 for a family of four, and $147,300 in Los Angeles.
Other programs target lower income families, but ignore the middle range.
“Teachers and nurses are stuck; they make too much for any government programs,” said Roxanne Mariok Girardo, a San Diego-area builder of homes in the $680,000 to $705,000 range. “The government gets in its own way when it makes up its rules. The middle income (class) usually makes too much, but not enough, to buy a house.”
Inheriting $84 trillion in wealth 
Upper-class homebuyers have a generational advantage. Their parents help with down payments and pass on homes and other assets as they die or age, a trend that’s only accelerating. By some estimates, $84 trillion in wealth will be passed down from older Americans to millennial and Gen X heirs by the end of 2045, including $16 trillion just in the next decade.
Such disparities will be even more glaring between races. Dream for All can play a small but important role in counteracting that.
It began as a first-come, first-served loan program, but the money was gone in 11 days. Many of its first recipients were white Sacramentans, prompting a flurry of changes to the program in the second year to produce a more diverse pool of recipients — racially and geographically. 
Now applicants have to be the first person in their family to ever own a home. And their income has to be under lower thresholds, closer to the median for each county. Even so, after last year’s lottery, the program had 4,500 qualifying families still on waiting lists for loans.
Also this time, 70% of loan voucher recipients are people of color, up from 55% last year, state officials said, citing preliminary statistics. 
“If the state doesn’t stay in the game, the housing crisis is going to get worse.”Al Abdallah, president of the Urban League of San Diego County
Latino families snapped up 39% of loan vouchers, far above their 30% share of California households, while Asian American and Pacific Islander families garnered 29% of vouchers when they’re 15% of the state’s households. 
Black homebuyers received 8% of the vouchers though they’re 6% of the population. That’s an improvement over last year’s 4% loan accumulation, but it’s nothing to crow about.
It’s nowhere near enough to begin closing one of California’s most shameful wealth gaps: The Black homeownership rate in California is 32% compared to whites’ rate of 56%. There are many forces at play, including decades of redlining, where banks and federal government-backed lenders refused to write mortgages in some neighborhoods, and restrictive covenants, which outlawed home sales to non-whites in some neighborhoods.
Discriminatory lending still occurs, and there are more loan denials, fewer bank branches and more payday lenders in Black and Latino neighborhoods than in other areas.

California Divide 
Dream for All: Down payment assistance for first-time California homebuyers relaunches with new lottery 

by Felicia Mello 





The Trump administration likely won’t reverse that. The White House has instead slashed programs that try to counteract these barriers to financing. That’s why Dream for All is so important: Other sources of home-buying assistance are at risk. 
One of the Urban League’s down payment programs that helped people of color was “paused” recently because a national nonprofit with federal contracts felt pressured by President Donald Trump’s DEI policies.
“If the state doesn’t stay in the game, the housing crisis is going to get worse. They have an obligation to,” said Al Abdallah, president of the Urban League of San Diego County, which counsels families on homeownership.
“When you have a mortgage you have rent control,” he said. “You’re building equity. You’re sending your kids to college … If homeownership is spread, equity builds in the hands of more than just a select few.”
Locked out of the housing market
State officials say they stand behind Dream for All, even though they’re not making plans to fund it. 
Originally it was pitched as a bigger and bolder program. When Toni Atkins was Senate President Pro Tem, she said Dream for All would lend $1 billion to 4,000 families a year, for 10 years. Instead it got about quarter of the annual funding she wanted and helped half the expected number of families.
Atkins, now running for governor, declined an interview but in a written statement said she understands why people need down payment assistance, having grown up in a rental home with no running water.
“Too many families are still locked out of the housing market,” she said, adding that solving the housing crisis takes “bold action, focused leadership and relentless determination.”
Newsom’s staff said he won’t comment on his budget plans. They did, however, note that when people repay their down payment loans, that money will go toward new loans, ensuring the program’s future.

But that seems too small, and could take years. 
If the program survives, it should expand and be more flexible, so more people qualify and more homes in high-priced places like San Diego and Los Angeles can be included. 
There shouldn’t be questions or qualifiers about who is most worthy of the loans — first-time homebuyers or first-generation homebuyers should qualify, as should families who can prove they or their ancestors were discriminated against.
Dream for All kept its promise for a few thousand people. For tens of thousands of others it was just a pipe dream. It could be so much more.

Feb. 25, 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Legislators right now are busy, busy trying to get through hundreds of bills. Despite technically starting a new session, leaders of the House and Senate said they hope to stick to the planned adjournment date of June 18.
Many bills are being passed under the hammer, meaning without a roll call, allowing lawmakers to reserve their floor speeches for legislation about which they feel most passionate. This week, that energy was largely reserved for debates about farmworker rights and expanding the Maine State Police force, while the age of Maine’s sitting U.S. senators also prompted some discussion.
Both chambers overwhelmingly backed legislation (LD 995) to provide one-time funding for low-income electricity consumers, providing an annual allocation of $7.5 million for the next two fiscal years to support eligible households. During the floor discussion, bill sponsor Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport) noted that on average in Maine, low income ratepayers are paying 8% of their income on power bills, which is double what is recommended. The House voted 120-26 and the Senate backed the bill without a roll call.
Both chambers unanimously passed a measure (LD 606) directing the Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources to study the bureau’s financial assistance programs for farmers and food producers to identify potential barriers, which should then be eliminated to increase the effectiveness of the programs.
The majority of the House and Senate also backed a bill (LD 837) that would require positions taken by the public advocate to be consistent with the cost-effective implementation of the state’s climate goals. The Senate voted 18-15 and the House 74-67. Sen. Matt Harrington (R-York), who opposed the bill, argued it would blur the lines to add climate goals to the Public Advocate’s directive, though bill sponsor Sen. Mark Lawrence (D-York) said it would clarify something not currently clear, that the public advocate can advocate for rate payers with the state’s established goals in mind. 
The House and Senate voted under the hammer to pass legislation (LD 130) proposed by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, which would codify programs supporting farms with high levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, into state law to ensure the support for farmers and remediation can continue. (More on this bill here)
Both chambers unanimously passed a bill (LD 6) to allow people to label their wild animal traps with the identification number issued by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Rep. Sally Cluchey (D-Bowdoinham) said it’s a simple but important bill that a trapper brought forward because she was concerned about the safety of her and her children after she was doxxed for trapping.
Lawmakers also largely agreed with the committee recommendation to reject LD 499 (House voting 88-57 and Senate doing so without a roll call), which would prohibit geoengineering in the state.
Some of the other bills that passed both chambers under the hammer: 

LD 1150 “An Act to Require Reporting of Sheltering or Aiding Missing Children”
LD 398, “An Act to Amend the Definition of “Transient Occupancy” in the Laws Governing the Maine Land Use Planning Commission”
LD 296 “An Act to Appropriate Funds to the Department of Environmental Protection, Lake Water Quality Restoration and Protection Fund”
LD 117, “An Act to Provide Funding for Sexual Assault Services” 
LD 472, “Resolve, Directing the Maine-Canadian Legislative Advisory Commission and the New England and Eastern Canada Legislative Commission to Examine Restoring Passenger Rail from Boston to Montreal”
LD 987, “An Act Clarifying Exemptions from the Notification Requirements for Products Containing PFAS”
LD 321, “An Act to Make May Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Month”, ought to pass report, passed under the hammer
LD 89, “Resolve, Regarding Legislative Review of Chapter 201: Employer Reporting and Payments, a Major Substantive Rule of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System”

Senate action
Before passing LD 588 by a vote of 21-13, senators had robust debate on the proposal to enact the Agricultural Employees Concerted Activity Protection Act, which gives agricultural employees of agricultural employers the right to engage in certain concerted activity. Sen. Scott Cyrway (R-Kennebec) said the measure is unnecessary and “just puts another layer of difficulty for farmers.” However, Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Portland) said the bill is “not about farmers” but rather about the fact that farmworkers “have been expressly excluded from our basic labor laws that protect most workers.” She also said if the body fails to pass the bill into law “this relegates a certain segment of our society to second class citizenry.” (More on this bill and other legislation to bolster farmworkers’ labor rights here.)
In an effort to speed things along, Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) introduced an order to amend a legislative rule that would make it so bills are automatically referenced to committees (something already being done on non-session days). Bennett had attempted to make this change earlier in session, too, but lawmakers opted for the current hybrid model. Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) raised concern that the adjustment would also change the basis for referencing,  giving bill sponsors greater ability to choose where their bill is heard. Instead, she suggested the order be referred to the Joint Rules Committee, which is tasked with establishing legislative processes (more on that here) — a motion that passed 18-15.
The Senate confirmed the reappointment of Kelly O’Connor of Camden to the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services by a 29-5 vote. 
Here are some bills passed by the Senate under the hammer:

LD 141 “An Act to Provide Limited Immunity to Maine Human Rights Commission Mediators” ought to pass, passed under hammer
LD 1545, “An Act to Clarify the Maximum Value That a Small Estate May Be Under the Maine Uniform Probate Code to Permit Collection of Personal Property by Affidavit”
LD 386, “An Act Regarding Information That May Be Shared by Law Enforcement Entities with a School Superintendent or a Principal”
LD 461, “An Act to Fund Rural Patrol Services in Washington County” (EMERGENCY) 

House action
A bill about who can be appointed to succeed a U.S. senator should they vacate the office caused a bit of a stir after leadership moved a motion not to pass the bill (which was the position of a minority of committee members). The House rejected that motion 56-90, forcing a motion to pass the bill, which advanced without a roll call. LD 749 specifies the nominated person must be enrolled in the same party as their predecessor (or in the case of an independent, they must be replaced by someone not enrolled in a party) with the floor discussion largely centering on the age of Maine’s two U.S. senators, Republican Susan Collins (72) and independent Angus King (81). Rep. Will Tuell (R- East Machias) noted that neither are “spring chickens,” and said if they are not able to fulfill their duties, he’d be concerned that Maine’s chief executive (currently a Democrat) could currently replace them with whoever they want. When the measure came up in the Senate a day later, it was tabled.
Legislation (LD 477) to add 15 new state trooper positions specifically to provide support to county sheriff department efforts in rural areas passed the House 117-26. Arguing in support, Rep. Tavis Hasenfus (D-Readfield) said that because of Maine’s size, there are times when certain areas have a hard time getting police presence. “Maine State Police are Maine’s police,” he said. Pointing to existing vacancies in Maine State Police, Rep. Grayson Lookner (D-Portland) argued that the Legislature should focus on other ways of addressing public safety, such as funding housing.
The House voted 111-29 in support of the committee recommendation against LD 535, which would allow a court to impose a sentence that includes commitment beyond 21 years of age for a juvenile adjudicated of murder or a Class A crime. 
Appropriations
​​Several bills were also moved to the “appropriations table,” where the budget committee can choose to support the measures with any remaining funds. These included: 

LD 457, “An Act to Fund Climate Resiliency Projects Related to the Repair of Campus
Infrastructure Used for Active Transportation and Outdoor Recreation” 
LD 462, “An Act to Amend the Eligibility Criteria for Creditable Service in the Armed Forces of the United States Under the Maine Public Employees Retirement System” 
LD 703, which would provide one-time funding of $500,000 for a health care gap year program that incentivizes recent college graduates to work in critical health care positions, particularly in underserved and rural communities passed both chambers. 
LD 70, to provide one-time funding of $250,000 for each year of the next biennium to the state’s five free health clinics
LD 884, “Resolve, to Establish the Criminal Justice Legal Aid Clinic Pilot Project at the University of Maine School of Law”
LD 109, directing the Maine Arts Commission to study national efforts to protect artists from copyright infringement by Artificial Intelligence companies and suggest potential legislation

Delaware Senate Republican leaders are applauding Governor Matt Meyer’s recent stance against the state’s controversial electric vehicle (EV) mandate, signaling renewed efforts to block the regulation first introduced under former Governor John Carney.
Senate Republican Whip Brian Pettyjohn, R-Georgetown, has circulated an updated version of Senate Bill 96, which aims to halt the adoption of the regulation modeled after California’s Advanced Clean Cars II standards.
The rule, spearheaded by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), would require 43% of new vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission or plug-in hybrids by model year 2027.
That number would climb to 82% by 2032.

“This was never about clean air, it was about control,” said Senate Republican Leader Gerald Hocker, R-Ocean View. “Delawareans have made it overwhelmingly clear they do not want an unelected state agency unilaterally dictating what kind of new cars they can or cannot buy.”
Republican lawmakers have consistently opposed the mandate, citing a 2023 public comment period in which more than 93% of nearly 5,000 responses expressed disapproval.
A separate poll conducted the same year found that 73% of Delaware voters opposed adopting California’s vehicle emissions rules, including many who otherwise support environmental initiatives.
Senator Pettyjohn emphasized the need for consumer choice over government mandates.
“People deserve choices, not mandates,” Pettyjohn said. “EVs may work well for some, but practically forcing them on everyone, especially without the infrastructure in place, is reckless. I thank Governor Meyer for recognizing that and listening to the people of Delaware instead of blindly following California’s lead.”
The revised bill is now being circulated among legislators for co-sponsorship.

“The primary cause” of the lowered expectations from the economy “is the global trade war,” Moody’s economist Emily Mandel told the five-member panel of private-sector financial analysts tasked with setting the revenue forecast used for the state budget. Specifically, higher tariffs and the uncertainty that comes with rapid changes in policy “will do real damage to the economy.”
Moody’s is predicting the economy will experience a “sharp reduction in growth” that will “technically avoid a recession” but “will be felt by households and businesses,” said Mandel.
She acknowledged their forecast of dodging a recession assumes there will be a pivot in the Trump administration’s trade policies, either because Trump will reach trade deals with scores of nations or he will scale back tariffs that are upending the U.S and global economy. Absent a scaling back, the economic outlook will worsen.
Trump’s pivot on trade policy would need to happen “within the next few months,” she added.
Mandel’s comments to Nevada echoed what economists have said at the national and international level.
“The economy is on the precipice of going into recession, and will likely go into one, unless policy takes a very sharp turn here pretty quickly,” Moody’s Chief Economist Mark Zandi was quoted as saying last week.
Consumer spending makes up two-thirds of the economy, and eroding consumer confidence can be a sign of a recession.
“In the past, we’ve seen that when we get a 20-point reduction over three months” in the consumer confidence index ”a recession will follow within 6 months,” Mandel said. “We’re currently at 19.3%. So we’re not there yet. But it’s a reason, just one of the reasons, we have a weaker forecast.”
Nevada numbers
The Economic Forum’s $191 million reduction to the revenue forecast was largely a result of lowered expectations of sales and use tax. They now expect the general fund’s portion of sales tax to bring in $3.68 billion over the biennium — a $100 million drop from what was projected in December.
Moody’s is forecasting sales tax revenue to rise compared to the current biennium but only because the prices consumers pay will increase with inflation. They expect the volume of goods being sold to remain flat.
Notably, the forum chose not to adjust Nevada’s gaming revenue for the upcoming biennium, despite concerns about tourism softening.
The most recent data from the Gaming Control Board appears to show the state struggling to maintain previous levels of gaming win. But the decreases have been minor, said Shelley Newell, senior economist for the Nevada Gaming Control Board.
“With the information and data we have, we had discussions with our licensees,” she said. “They are very aware and cognizant of their numbers, and they do what it takes because they want to be successful in their business. They want the patrons in their establishments.”
Moody’s forecasted a sharp 8% decline in gaming for the upcoming fiscal year. When asked about that prediction by a forum member, Mandel stood by it.
“It sounds like a lot is being baked in, a lot of negative possibilities are being baked in,” commented Economic Forum Chair Linda Rosenthal while asking about the economic assumptions Mandel made to get to that number.
“We’re expecting a decline. I don’t know that I would call it dire relative to the realm of possibilities,” Mandel said, adding that she considered how gaming revenue performed during past, non-pandemic recessions.
The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has acknowledged that international tourism has dipped.
Canadians make up 10 to 13% of total visitors to Las Vegas, depending on who’s estimating. David Schmidt, an economist with the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation (DETR), cited an analysis from UNLV’s Center for Business and Economic Research that found Canadian tourism supports more Las Vegas jobs (43,200) than manufacturing (33,700) does.
Mauricio Solorio, an economist within the Governor’s Finance Office, noted his forecast assumes the drop in tourism from Canada and Mexico could be partially offset by increased tourism from Europeans taking advantage of what’s expected to be a weaker American dollar.
Several European nations and Canada have issued travel advisories warning their citizens of the risks of getting caught up in Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement policies.
The Economic Forum also chose to lower expectations for the state’s modified business tax (MBT) by $56.51 million. Economists attributed the expected drop in MBT to businesses scaling back expansion plans because of intense uncertainty accompanying Trump administration policies.
“Obviously, the outlook has deteriorated,” said Haley Owens, an economist with the Legislative Counsel Bureau. “We don’t expect to lose jobs in this forecast, but we have lowered our growth expectations both for jobs and wages.”
Mining tax revenue was adjusted upward by $1.23 million. Gold, by far the most valuable mineral mined in Nevada, is a safe haven investment that tends to increase substantially in price during economic crises.
Mining was one of three revenue streams adjusted upward. The others were the state’s insurance premium tax and real property transfer tax.
The forum bumped up insurance premium revenue stream by $46.29 million over the biennium. That helped offset some of the downward revisions elsewhere, but it will likely come at the cost of higher premiums paid by Nevadans for auto and home insurance.
The real property transfer tax was adjusted up by $6.86 million.
Democrats, Lombardo respond
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office in a statement called the reductions made by the Economic Forum “manageable.”
“While many fiscal decisions remain during the Legislative Session, the State will be able to mitigate and balance the updated revenue projections,” read the statement.
Meanwhile, Democrats were quick to emphasize that the reduction in expected revenue is a direct result of policies put in place by the Trump administration.
Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, in a press gaggle after the forum, said the Legislature will now be “maintaining as much as we can with what we have.”
“I think the focus for us now is to make sure that we are keeping intact the services and programs that we have,” she said. “To continue to provide healthcare for working families, to continue to provide education to children. Those are going to be at the forefront of everyone’s minds.”
Cannizzaro acknowledged that additional financial uncertainty looms. The Economic Forum’s projection only covers the state’s general fund revenue, which lawmakers generally get to decide how to spend.
The State Education Fund, which funds Nevada’s K-12 public schools, is a separate pot of money funded by the Local Schools Support Tax (LSST), part of the statewide sales tax rate. The LSST rate (2.6%) is higher than general fund sales tax rate (2%), meaning the State Education Fund will likely be looking at its own decline of at least $100 million — likely more since it is also funded by the general fund and other revenue streams that might be impacted by a weakening economy.
Cannizzaro said the forecast for the State Education Fund is expected to be finalized in the next week.
Also still looming over Nevada is the threat of Congress slashing federal funding for widely used programs like Medicaid. If that happens, states will be forced to either cut services or find additional revenue to continue funding services at current levels.
The likelihood of Nevada being able to backfill lost federal revenue is highly unlikely, she said.Cannizzaro did not rule out the possibility of tapping the state’s Rainy Day Fund, formally known as the Account to Stabilize the Operation of the State Government. Lombardo’s office also mentioned the fund in its statement, which similarly acknowledged the potential for future revenue shortfalls.
“Should any unexpected budget issues arise later in the upcoming biennium, Nevadans can rest assured that the State is well-prepared to navigate moments of fiscal uncertainty, especially with the record amount of money in the Rainy Day Fund under Governor Lombardo’s leadership,” read the statement.
Transfer amounts to Nevada’s Rainy Day Fund are set and required by state law: 1% of anticipated revenue each fiscal year, as well as a portion of excess general fund collections.
However, Lombardo last session did successfully spearhead an effort to raise the Rainy Day Fund cap from 20% to 26% of appropriations from the state general fund.
In September 2024, Lombardo and State Treasurer Zach Conine announced the Rainy Day Fund had reached an all-time high of $1.24 billion.
Nevada also has additional reserve funds housed in the Education Stabilization Account, a separate rainy day fund for education set up in 2019.
Mayday
The Economic Forum is statutorily required to meet in December of even-numbered years to approve a revenue forecast. That forecast is used as the base for the governor’s recommended budget, which is given to the Legislature for consideration.
The forum is required to meet again on or before May 1 of odd-numbered years to reconsider their forecast and make adjustments. That forecast must be reflected in the balanced budget passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor by the final day of the legislative session.
Lawmakers are considering changing that timeline. Senate Bill 419, which is quietly making its way through the Legislature, proposes changing the date for reconsidering the forecast to April 1.
In a hearing for the bill, Democratic state Sen. Marilyn Dondero Loop noted the current May 1 deadline predates the state’s 120-day session cap, which was put in place via a constitutional amendment in 1998. Moving the date would give the leg more time to adjust budget accordingly.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nevada-leg-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 09:08:04.314113

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah state leaders are being sued over a bill passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Spencer Cox in March created a new guardianship system for adults with “severe” intellectual disability. 
In a complaint filed in federal court in Utah earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Disability Law Center argued the law — SB199 — violates the American With Disabilities and the Rehabilitation acts, as well as the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which grants equal protection under the law to all citizens. 
Sponsored by Sen. Kevin Stratton, R-Orem, and signed by Cox on March 17, SB199 creates a separate guardianship proceeding for people with a “severe” intellectual disability. To qualify, a physician or psychologist must sign a letter “that indicates that the adult is an individual with a severe intellectual disability,” the bill reads. 
Guardianship is a legal process where someone, typically a family member, can ask a court to determine whether a person with a disability 18 years old or older is unable to make decisions and manage their affairs.

With permission from a court, the guardian could then determine personal care and make financial and legal decisions for the disabled person. According to the Utah Parent Center, it can shield disabled people from manipulation and crime, allowing them to live a safer life. But it also limits the civil rights of the person under guardianship, taking away their authority to make adult decisions.  
The bill had the backing from several families of people with intellectual disabilities, who say the current system is too broad and not tailored to the most severely handicapped. More than 200 people signed on to a petition in support of the bill. 
“It makes sense to create a new and separate guardianship statutory section specifically for those with a severe intellectual disability and a lifelong functional limitation that began as a minor,” said Lisa Thornton, an attorney, when speaking in favor of the bill during this year’s legislative session. “Separating our population from the elderly, or ones who once had capacity, allows for greater protection for those with severe intellectual disabilities without impacting or creating restrictions on the elderly, or those who may regain capacity.” 
But during the session, both the ACLU and Disability Law Center spoke out against the bill. On April 18, the groups filed a lawsuit. 
In the 42-page complaint, the groups argue the law creates a “separate, harsher” guardianship system based on a classification of “severe intellectual disability” — a term they say is “circular and vague.” 
“‘Severe intellectual disability’ is not a term with a clear, well-established meaning among clinicians,” the complaint reads, adding that it requires physicians to make a diagnosis that is typically made by the court. 
The law also allows a guardian to “restrict the disabled person’s association with friends and family, the right to control their food and beverage consumption, and the right to restrict any activity that the guardian believes would be harmful,” according to court documents. Typically, guardians can place restrictions on an individual basis — for instance, preventing an abusive former partner from visiting. But SB199 allows for blanket restrictions, which the complaint says is a violation of the person’s rights. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Additionally, the law creates a carveout where the disabled person wouldn’t be granted an attorney in cases where a parent, grandparent or sibling is the prospective guardian, the groups argue.
For those reasons, the groups allege the state is in violation of the American With Disabilities and the Rehabilitation acts, as well as the 14th Amendment. 
“SB199 creates a separate, more restrictive guardianship for a class of people with disabilities and denies them the same rights as others, like the right to talk with friends or relatives, solely based on a doctor describing the severity of a diagnosis,” said Nate Crippes, the public affairs supervising attorney for the Disability Law Center. 
“It also doesn’t allow for individualized determinations for this population, as is required by the ADA,” he added.“And by limiting the right to associate, if a guardian is abusive or neglectful, we fear no one will know. On the other hand, studies show a person with greater self-determination is more likely to identify an abusive situation and less likely to experience it.”
In addition to Cox and the state of Utah, the lawsuit names Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Durrant, the Utah Judicial Council, State Court Administrator Ronald Gordon Jr., the Utah Administrative Office of the Courts and the Utah State Court system.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate passed a bill Thursday to allow the state’s dominant agricultural organization to offer its members health benefit plans.
HB 477, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, would allow the Alabama Farmers Federation (Alfa), the state’s dominant agricultural organization, to offer a health plan that is outside of state insurance regulations and only available to its members. The bill passed 30-2 and heads to the governor.
Supporters said the legislation would help farmers and other self-employed agricultural workers who do not have access to employer-sponsored plans to get more affordable coverage. 
“If we don’t do something to help our young farmers out, we’re not going to have any because they’ve got to go to work somewhere else just to get insurance,” said Sen. Jack Williams, R-Wilmer.

The bill specifies that Alfa would not be engaged in the business of health insurance and imposes a 1.3% tax on premiums. Alfa’s health benefits must include coverage for ambulatory patient services; hospitalization; emergency services; laboratory services; mental health and substance abuse disorder services and prescription drugs. Benefits or services covered under a health benefit would not be subject to an annual limit of less than $2 million per year per enrollee.
“This is a freedom-of-contract issue … it’s a simple issue in my in my head, as far as the freedom to contract, freedom to do what you want, and have a an organization enter into this type of arrangement with its members for some form of health coverage,” said Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, who is handling the bill in the Senate.
Democrats tried to amend the bill on the floor to align the proposed health benefit plan more with health insurance, but each amendment was voted down due to concerns about keeping the price of the health plans low.
Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, who said she was concerned about denied claims and how consumers could appeal such denials, offered an amendment that would have authorized the Alabama Department of Insurance to “enforce” the bill in order to offer consumer protection. Similar language was added in an amendment to the original House bill but later removed from it. 
“What happens to the health services when an emergency claim is denied? Who do the farmers go to get some kind of mediation?” asked Coleman-Madison. The amendment failed on a 9-24 vote.
Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, raised concerns about pre-existing conditions and the potential impact on farmers. He said that farmers may work around substances like ammonia, which may negatively impact their health.
“[Farmers] want to get insured, because they all are supporting this plan, but they going to be in for some rude awakening when they go there and get their record check, and now they have some kind of lung disease or cancer or something, and then they’re going to be told that they can’t get insurance,” Singleton said.
His amendment failed on a 9-23 vote.
Singleton offered another amendment to raise the premium tax from 1.3%  to 1.6% for each year based on the premiums collected.
“I don’t think it will kill them, that they could pay that back to the people of the state of Alabama,” Singleton said.
Orr opposed the amendment, saying that he thinks “it’s important to keep tax rate low and make this an affordable policy for people that want to participate.” The amendment failed on a 8-25 vote.
When asked after the bill passed if he was concerned the plan would not be regulated like health insurance or that it could negatively impact a policyholder, Williams said that “some coverage is better than none.”
“If you don’t get the whole foot in, you get eight inches in, and it’s working, it’s better than what you got,” Williams said.
The bill now heads to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature.

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Local elected officials, planning and transportation representatives along with developers gathered Thursday around a central question: how do we address Southern Nevada’s ongoing housing shortage?
Much of the early focus at Regional Affordable Housing Forum, hosted by the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority, was directed at the longstanding request to open more federal public land in sprawling areas surrounding the Las Vegas valley as a tool to build housing.
During a panel discussion, led by M.J. Maynard, the CEO with the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada, around the intersection of affordable housing and transportation, the conversation focused back to infill development. 
“There is also talk that we will build affordable housing in the outlying areas,” Maynard said. “Well, there is no public transit out there. There has to be a connection between where people live, where they work and how they get there.”
Nevada, like most of the nation, is experiencing an affordable housing crisis with the most extremely burdened renters unable to find places to live.  
There are only 17 available homes for every 100 extremely low income households making less than 30% of the area median income, $21,000 for a single person and about $32,000 for a family of four, compared to 94 available homes per 100 renter households making 100% of AMI, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
There simply aren’t enough places for people to live, especially without paying more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities – the very definition of affordable housing used by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
Housing groups and environmental groups have warned against unsustainable urban sprawl that comes from building outward. 
David Damore, executive director UNLV’s public policy think tank Lincy Institute and Brookings Mountain West, who spoke alongside Maynard on Thursday, said research has shown outside the city limits isn’t where people want to live.  
A survey from the National Association of Realtors showed “you’re starting to see less people want to live in the suburbs,” he said. 
People want to live near where they work and avoid long commutes, panelists agreed. 
“The good news is that there are opportunities to do this in the urban core,” Damore said, pointing to a recent analysis by the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada and the regional planning collaborative known as Southern Nevada Strong.
The plan identified around 80,000 acres of vacant or underused land in the Southern Nevada area. While a significant portion was in the urban core, he said there were also parts in Boulder City and Mesquite, Damore said. 
Earlier in the forum, during a panel including the mayors of Henderson, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Mesquite and Boulder City, along with Clark County Commissioner William McCurdy discussed affordable housing, Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkely acknowledged that “it’s going to be very important to infill (development) and start building up instead of out.”
But that was the only instance of local elected officials mentioning infill development, the mayors focusing their discussion instead on Southern Nevada’s traditional planning strategy — expanding the metro area’s footprint — and reiterating support for  the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act, commonly referred to as the Clark County Lands Bill. 
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and U.S. Rep. Susie Lee, both Democrats, reintroduced the bill that would open 25,000 acres of public land in Southern Nevada and they say could lead to development of more affordable housing. 
McCurdy said during the discussion that the county has been working “very diligently with the federal delegation and county staff to offer more amendments to that bill” including clarifications on any specific provisions around development for specific area median incomes. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Dina Titus recently told Nevada Current she was opposed to the bill as written because it has no set aside for affordable housing, “ encourages expensive urban sprawl,” would create burdens on the state’s limited water supply, and fails to address infrastructure needed to grow outward.
Interviewed after the forum, McCurdy said he agreed infill development would better address issues that come from urban sprawl, such as helping to reduce the county’s carbon footprint. 
He said while the county was pursuing infill development “it isn’t an either/or” when it comes to infill development versus building outside the county limits. 
“At this moment we can’t just say lets just do infill development and not offer the release of land to municipalities,” he said. “We need all of it.”
Maynard asked other transportation and community developer officials how they would address the housing crisis. 
Shani Coleman, the director of Clark County’s office of Community & Economic Development, said county officials are considering ways to encourage  adding residential components to commercial developments.
She pointed to Commercial Center, a shopping complex along Maryland Parkway and Sahara Avenue. 
There currently is no housing in the center, but the county “is talking about a masterplan that could include housing as well as transportation.” Coleman said, adding multiple other Southern Nevada commercial developments could potentially also be transformed to include housing.
There is “a sea of …  shopping centers and other other complexes around here that are ripe for development, that sit already in our urban areas along our transportation corridors,” Coleman said. “Just because you see something here right now doesn’t mean that has to be the end of what that looks like.”
Lombardo’s housing bill
City and county officials on their panel also praised Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s housing bill, Assembly Bill 540. The legislation proposes to allocate $250 million in funding to build more housing and expands the definition of affordable housing to households with incomes near or above six figures.
Throughout the forum, many presenters spoke about the need to build attainable housing and “workforce housing.”
“There is something called affordable housing and something called attainable housing and the two are very different,” Maynard said at the beginning of her panel.  
Some officials at the forum acknowledged that as they were meeting Thursday, the state’s Economic Forum determined how much to pare back the state’s budget projections as a result of the hits delivered to the economy by Donald Trump’s tariff policies. But none of the officials  noted that diminished revenue projections projects could potentially put Lombardo’s housing bill at risk.
Later on in the morning, U.S. Rep. Stephen Horsford, via a video message, hammered Trump’s on again, off again tariffs that have rattled markets and launched the economy toward what many observers warn is a recession.
“Because of blanket tariffs on aluminum, lumber and steel, all of which are imported from Mexico and Canada, it’s compounding on the challenges we are already experiencing by driving the material costs up by another 10 to 15% and possibly as high as 25%,” Horsford said. “This affects budgeting, timelines and ultimately who can and cannot afford a home.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0321-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 09:08:04.314113

Unless the credits are extended, Alaskans insured through the federal health insurance marketplace — about 25,000 people — could see their rates rise by an average of 67%. 
The House passed House Joint Resolution 9 by a vote of 26-14 on Monday. It is scheduled for a hearing in the Senate Health and Social Services Committee on Tuesday.
If approved by the Senate, the resolution would be sent to President Donald Trump and members of Alaska’s congressional delegation, asking them to “champion the extension of enhanced premium tax credits, prioritizing the health and economic stability of the state’s residents by ensuring that affordable health care remains accessible to all.”
Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, sponsored the resolution.
“We know that health care costs, as they will increase, would jeopardize small businesses and entrepreneurship. We are facing a tough fiscal situation. Enhanced premium tax credits make health care more affordable with no cost to the state,” she said, speaking Friday on the House floor. “And if these subsidies expire, we’ll see more people who are uninsured. We’ll see more people go on to Medicaid, which will cost more for the state, and additionally we will see impacts to our economy and small businesses.”
All 14 votes against the resolution came from members of the House’s minority Republican caucus.
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, said that the resolution asks Congress to make COVID-era relief permanent, at a cost of more than $300 billion.
“When we ask for Congress to do things that increase our deficit, we are increasing inflation  that harms Alaskans,” she said. 
“When we are asking Congress to take measures that are going to increase the debt by billions  of dollars, we’re making things worse in the long term for Alaskans,” Vance said in opposition.
Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, is a member of the minority. He voted in support of the resolution but noted that he did so with reluctance. 
“I struggle with this resolution because it’s like a Band-Aid on an arterial bleed,” he said. “It doesn’t actually fix the problem of affordable insurance and quality health care. It’s just funnelling a ton of money we take from people, into the pockets of insurance companies so they can charge people less money for insurance premiums, and I don’t know if that model is sustainable.”

The American Lung Association’s 2025 State of the Air report found that the St. Louis and Kansas City areas both had poorer outcomes for some measures of air quality compared to previous years.
St. Louis was ranked 21st worst city across the country for its ozone levels this year, after being ranked 30th last year.  Kansas City was ranked 34th worst for its ozone levels, compared to 48th for 2024’s report.
In Missouri, 19 of the state’s 114 counties have official air quality monitors that feed data back to the Environmental Protection Agency for monitoring.
In all 19 monitored counties, ozone levels worsened in the years spanning the report, said Laura Turner, the director of advocacy at the Missouri chapter of the American Lung Association.
“That was something that really stood out to me,” Turner said. “We know asthma can really be influenced by air quality, and ozone is particularly problematic for people with asthma, especially kids with asthma.”
Air quality monitoring infrastructure is mostly concentrated near Missouri’s urban areas, such as counties surrounding Kansas City, St. Louis, Columbia and Springfield. But some monitors are scattered across rural counties as well.
In urban areas, things like high vehicle traffic and concentrations of industrial output can worsen air quality and be associated with higher rates of lung diseases and other chronic conditions. In more rural parts of the state, manufacturing, mining and agriculture all contribute to poorer air quality.
Plus, high-pollutant industries tend to be concentrated in lower-income areas, where residents are predisposed to other forms of chronic health conditions, said Caitlin Stiltner, a staff attorney at Great Rivers Environmental Law Center in St. Louis, which works for free to represent clients in environmental cases.
“When issuing air permits under the Clean Air Act to some of these industries, they’re disproportionately located near low-income and communities of color,” Stiltner said. “You’re seeing higher levels of asthma and lung cancers in those areas.”
The report found that people of color make up 41.2% of the overall population nationwide, but account for 50.2% of the people living in counties with at least one failing metric in the report.
From 2021 to 2023, 125.2 million Americans were exposed to potentially unsafe ozone levels, an increase of 24.6 million people from last year’s report. Unsafe ozone has been linked with worsening symptoms for those with asthma and COPD and higher risk of respiratory infections.
“One thing that does contribute to ozone across the board is increased temperatures,” Turner said. “When you have higher temperatures, you’re going to see more ozone formation. …That’s just a pretty direct correlation.”
There were improvements in year-round particle pollution, which come from things like factories, power plants and diesel and gasoline vehicles that generate things like nitrogen or sulfur oxides. Increases in long-term particle pollution have been linked with higher likelihood of childhood asthma and lung cancer.
The report found that 85 million people were exposed to year-round levels of particle pollution that don’t meet air quality standards, compared to 90.7 million for 2024’s report.
 Urban areas bear the brunt

Areas concentrated around Kansas City and St. Louis had the poorest grades in the lung association’s 2025 report.
In the Kansas City area, Clay and Clinton counties received an F for high ozone days, while Cass County received a C. Jackson County did not collect data covered in the report. St. Louis city and St. Louis, St. Genevieve, St. Charles, Lincoln and Jefferson counties all received an F for higher ozone days.
People living in poverty are more likely to live close to sources of pollution and have fewer resources to relocate out of a potentially unhealthy area.
Out of Jackson County’s nearly 720,000 residents, for example, nearly 85,000 live in poverty and are considered an at-risk group, the report found. More than 13,000 kids are statistically at risk because of pediatric asthma rates, and another more than 55,000 asthmatic adults are at risk. Another 44,500 are statistically more at risk due to COPD.
Stiltner pointed to a mapping tool that can track facilities with air permits under the Clean Air Act and compare them with rates of asthma, cancer and other diseases.
“We can see the permitted facilities and then overlay it with rates of asthma, rates of lung cancer and other types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, everything,” Stiltner said. “And there’s higher rates near these facilities. These communities are experiencing a cumulative impact from every facility that’s feeding air permits in these areas.”
Both Great Rivers and the American Lung Association are advocating to increase the number of  air quality monitors placed throughout the state. But they aren’t holding out hope, given cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency at the federal level.
“There’s simply not enough air monitors for us to do enforcement on some of these facilities,” Stiltner said. “If they’re not complying with their air permits, proving that the facility is a source of (pollutants) is difficult when there are only a few air monitors near the city.”
Other organizations, including community groups and researchers, run their own air quality monitoring programs, but those reports are not considered official data sources when it comes to enforcement of the Clean Air Act.
 Rural Missouri’s lack of air quality monitors

Andrew, Buchanan, Callaway, Cedar, Jasper, Monroe and Perry counties are the rural parts of the state that have EPA-certified air quality monitors.
All of the counties — besides Buchanan, which does not collect the data — received C or F scores for the number of high ozone days in the report. Many do not collect back high particle pollution figures, the report found.
In rural areas, industries like manufacturing, mining and agriculture all contribute to poorer air quality.
“There are so many gaps between these monitors and the rural communities where there is no monitor there yet,” said Bruce Morrison, who serves as general counsel at Great Rivers. “Whether it’s a factory, a new quarry or some kind of operation that generates air pollutants, it’s something that is not even being monitored. Those health effects are going to be real for the people that live there.”
A lack of monitoring does not equate to a lack of pollution, the lung association said in its report. The group urges Missouri to invest in research programs to gather data, use other forms of technology to track pollutants and to use data for public health protection.
Emissions from many industries are unavoidable, said Frank Mitloehner, a professor and air quality specialist at the University of California-Davis department of animal science. He studies pollutants that come from large-scale animal farming operations, such as dairy and poultry farms.
Ammonia is one agricultural output that can contribute to higher levels of PM 2.5, a pollutant that is measured when assessing air quality. If concentrations are too high, it can be dangerous for neighboring communities and those who work on farms.
“What I can assure you is nobody is sitting back and not worrying about these things,” Mitloehner said. “Farmers do not want to have issues with neighboring communities.”
Mitloehner said that while farmers are working to reduce their emissions, it’s difficult to do so without larger profit margins.
“Some have a low profit margin, and they will do things if they are forced to, but it has no production advantage to them,” he said. “If nobody pays for it, then the question is, ‘Who foots the bill?’ You can only be green if you’re in the green.”
And as the Trump administration rolls back regulation, environmental standards are caught in the fray.
The EPA has been operating under a provision called the endangerment finding, which concludes that climate change threatens public health. The measure has led to new standards on how much pollution is released into the air.
Under the Trump administration, the federal agency is exploring ways to roll back at least 31 air, water and emissions regulations related to the endangerment finding, and experts say the rollbacks could harm public health.
Now, if states want to uphold the standards that may be stripped away, the responsibility will fall on their shoulders. The lawyers at Great Rivers don’t expect Missouri to step in to enforce defunct regulations.
Earlier this month, utility company Ameren asked the Trump administration for exemptions for two coal plants in the St. Louis region, giving the company two additional years to limit emissions and unsafe air pollutants.
“Without the EPA making those rules,” Morrison said, “then there’s nothing really holding states and industries from having stronger controls on pollution.”

HOMEWOOD — Nine-year-old Ruby Banta thought it was a pretty simple choice, even for adults.
“This was the salamander’s habitat first,” she said after an afternoon soccer game. “It’s not a college habitat.”
Ruby was among the youngest of activists—sending a crayon-colored appeal to the City Council to save a sensitive salamander site—who had reason to celebrate this week. Officials at Samford University, a Baptist college just outside of Birmingham, announced a new location for sports fields in a planned commercial development that would have encroached on the habitat of the local spotted salamander population.
Dozens of Homewood residents, Samford community members and local environmentalists had opposed the earlier master plan of a development called Creekside. Homewood closely identifies with the salamander, which burrows on the slopes of Shades Mountain and migrates across South Lakeshore Drive every spring. For the past 20 years, the city has held a salamander festival to educate the public about its slippery spotted neighbor.

At a press conference Monday, the chief executive of Landmark Development, the company contracted by Samford University to complete the project, claimed victory in saving the population that his company’s proposal had put at risk.
“I think we can stand up now and very confidently say, ‘We saved the salamanders,’” Robert Dunn said about the agreement among the city, the university and Landmark to redraw its plans. “The issues of concern did not fall on deaf ears.” The sports facilities are now planned to be built further west to avoid the salamander habitat.
In Homewood, a fight for the spotted salamander

Ruby’s mother, Allison Banta, explained that the girl had learned about the salamander’s dilemma by reading an Inside Climate News report over her mother’s shoulder one night. She “was immediately enthusiastic about figuring out how to help,” Banta said.
Ruby, who has a pet lizard named Popcorn, told her third-grade teachers about the situation. She drafted a letter to City Council members about the salamander’s plight. “Please don’t build there,” Ruby wrote, her crayon drawing of a yellow-spotted salamander adorning the top of the page. “Samford already has an amazing school.”
She recruited friends to shift an already-planned yard sale to benefit Friends of Shades Creek, an all-volunteer nonprofit organization in central Alabama that publicized the threat. “Save the spotted salamander,” the children’s cardboard sign read.

Ruby is no stranger to the salamander. After a soccer game Tuesday, she chatted about a trip she’d taken during its mating season. She ventured out in her pajamas on a rainy night to help the creatures cross a roadway to one of several vernal pools where they lay eggs.
“We had to help them cross because it’s a pretty big road,” Ruby said. “So we have to protect them.”
University of Alabama at Birmingham biologist Megan Gibbons was among the organizers of the broader community opposition to the development and was pleasantly surprised when she heard the change in plans.
“I expected this would be an uphill battle that would end in disappointment,” Gibbons said. “But this is a rare win for the environment.”
“This is SUCH GREAT news!” Alabama Rivers Alliance, a statewide network of groups aimed to protect water resources, posted on social media. “Thank you to Friends of Shades Creek, Cahaba Riverkeeper, Cahaba River Society and everyone else who spoke up for the spotted salamanders! Compromises and creative solutions can be found when the right voices are gathered and heard.”
The environmental nonprofit that benefited from Ruby’s yard sale praised the decision and process in a statement. “Friends of Shades Creek is profoundly grateful to Samford University and Landmark for their willingness to listen to our concerns about the salamander vernal pool habitat and open mindedness to find a new solution for Creekside East.”











This is a rare win for the environment.


– Megan Gibbons, University of Alabama at Birmingham biologist



Samford University’s president said this week that the residents provided useful information and helped all parties reconsider. The development, billed as a “livable town square environment” including shops and eateries, is part of the university’s plan to expand and enhance its campus.
“Like any large development, we needed to hear the feedback of our community and the citizens of Homewood. The largest concern that was voiced was ecological damage, not just the salamanders but also the watershed and other related issues,” university president Beck A. Taylor said in a statement.
“We considered the concerns of our community and we went back to the drawing board. We tried to find an equally attractive opportunity or alternative. We found it. In fact, I would argue that it’s a much better alternative for us.”
Gibbons said the new plan shows that positive change can happen when residents band together. Ruby and her friends were a notable example, she said.
The yard sale, she said, is “motivating for other kids. It’s motivating for neighbors, and it should be motivating for an institution like Samford.”
Despite this win, the threat of habitat loss for salamanders and other plants and animals is ever present, she said.
Research shows that spotted salamander populations are on the decline.
Three out of every five salamander species are at risk of extinction. Of the many threatened amphibian species, more than 90 percent face habitat loss, the most common threat.
“You can name any animal or plant, and if they’re in trouble—if their populations are in decline—the main reason is probably because of unbridled development. Development that’s not taking into account the environmental circumstances and the plants and animals that live there,” Gibbons said.
Even small wins in the face of imminent development are encouraging, she said.
“If we have more outcomes like this, maybe we can begin to reverse this pattern of habitat loss and destruction,” Gibbons said. “We need to be careful about where we’re developing and develop in an environmentally conscious way. It’s a constant battle, but we have to show up to the fight.”

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)As far as Ed Hale is concerned, it’s all over but the paperwork.
Hale, the current owner of the Baltimore Blast indoor soccer team and a longtime city banker and business owner, said he is committed to mounting a Democratic primary challenge in 2026 to Gov. Wes Moore (D), at the urging of friends who he said are worried about the future of the state.
It’s just talk for the moment, but Hale said Thursday that he is pulling together all the paperwork and disclosure forms that will be needed to make it official.
“I’m getting everything together … and that’s it, and I hope to file it on Monday or Tuesday after working through the weekend to get it all done,” said Hale, 78.
“When I’m done, you know, I will have some sort of press announcement,” he said.
The primary election is not until June 30, 2026, but Hale might need all that time to mount a challenge to Moore, a formidable candidate despite some recent bumps in the road.
While recent polls have shown Moore’s job approval slipped a bit, as state officials juggled new taxes and program cuts to close a $3 billion gap in next year’s budget, his ratings were still above 50% three years into his first term, with 52% of voters in a February poll saying they approved of the job he is doing. Among Democrats, who would be voting in the 2026 primary, 79% said they approve of Moore.
Early GOP candidate for governor taps former delegate as running mate

Moore is a prodigious fundraiser who reportedly has $4 million in the bank already. He will be 47 next summer to Hale’s 79. And the governor frequently makes appearances on national stages and is often talked about as a possible presidential contender in 2028 — speculation he rejected repeatedly during an appearance Thursday on “The View.”
Moore’s office declined to comment Thursday on the possibility of a primary challenge from Hale.
Even in a decidedly blue state like Maryland, the winner of the primary will have to face general election challengers, and the GOP already has one ticket in the race. Republican John Myrick filed for governor in February, the earliest possible date to do so, and he announced his running mate on Wednesday, former Washington County Del. Brenda Thiam.
More daunting would be a race against former Gov. Larry Hogan (R), whose popularity numbers rivaled Moore’s through his two terms in office and who is repeatedly mentioned as a possible 2026 candidate for his old job.
Hale said his decision to run came after discussions with many friends, who were lamenting the direction of the state, particularly its fiscal situation and business climate.
“I talked to [former Maryland Insurance Commissioner] Al Redmer and some other guys, and this is terrible, what’s happening in the state,” Hale said, describing their discussions. “‘Can’t you come up with anybody?’ We were goose hunting on my farm. And finally, people started calling me, why don’t you consider doing it?
“So I just thought about and thought about it, and just decided to do it,” Hale said.
He stresses his business background, noting that he built his businesses from the ground up, with no family money and no college education. Hale waxes poetic about the natural beauty of the state and its many cultural and economic advantages, but said he worries about its future.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
He said he is most concerned about the state’s financial future.
“I hear about the budget, and I hear it’s going to get worse, not better,” Hale said. “I’m not here to criticize the problem. I’m just coming in trying to be part of the solution.”
Hale concedes that Moore would be a formidable opponent who will run a well-organized and well-funded race for reelection. But he said he is not worried by the prospect of raising the money and building the organization that will be needed to challenge a popular incumbent.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland parents who hope to get a state-funded child care scholarship will have to wait awhile.
Faced with a tripling in the number of families in the scholarship program managed by the state Department of Education, state officials imposed a freeze on new awards effective Thursday. Parents can still apply, but will be placed on a waiting list until a space opens up in the program.
Families already enrolled will continue to receive funding.
Tara Phillips, executive director of the state Department of Education’s Early Childhood Division, said at a Board of Education meeting Tuesday nearly 45,000 child care scholarships have been approved — up from about 15,000 scholarships in 2021. State officials hope to reduce the number of recipients and cap it at 40,000 by the fall, when they could reopen the waitlist.
“If it takes longer or there’s fewer families that drop off, then it’s just going to take longer for them to have spaces on the waitlist,” Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), one of the legislative leaders on early childhood, said Thursday.
Solomon said there are a few exceptions for parents and guardians who have one child on a scholarship and may decide to apply for a second one for a younger child. And those who receive Temporary Cash Assistance or Supplemental Security Income will still be eligible to receive a scholarship.
Solomon, who chairs the Oversight Committee on Personnel, a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, acknowledged that the budget issues that made for a “tough session” this spring will likely continue through the summer as the state is expected to grapple with the fallout of more federal budget cuts and layoffs.
“The actions of the federal government are only going to make it harder and make it worse for us to provide the kind of wraparound and support services and education that we really want,” Solomon said.
“Over the course of the summer and through the interim, we’re going to be working on coming up with sustainable sources of funding so that we don’t have to continue the waitlist, [and] put the investments into child care and early learning that we need to be able to serve the families of Maryland,” he said.
On Tuesday, the state Board of Education heard from several early childhood officials, providers and advocates to celebrate April as the Month of the Young Child. According to a report this year from the Maryland Family Network, the estimated cost of child care in the state was nearly $25,000 a year.
“Child Care is more expensive than state college tuition in Maryland,” said Christina Peusch, executive director of the Maryland State Child Care Association.
Anabella Rodas, president of the Latino Child Care Association of Maryland, said the child care industry should be respected, especially with early childhood being one of the five priorities in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
“We’re not babysitters. We’re early childhood educators, just as the teachers in public school,” she said. “When we invest in educators, we invest in children’s futures.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Annabella-Rodas-4-29-2025-1024x537.jpg,,,2025-05-02 08:02:24.870712

She was removed from office in July after being sentenced for stealing more than $6,600. (Photo courtesy maryland.gov)The former Anne Arundel County register of wills who was booted from office last year for misconduct faces new legal problems following a shoplifting conviction.
Erica Griswold was convicted in Anne Arundel County District Court in Glen Burnie Thursday following a nearly 90-minute trial. The conviction is likely to trigger a violation in her probation for a 2024 guilty plea related to stealing more than $6,600.
Griswold, sitting at the defense table, shook her head in disagreement as prosecutors recounted her theft of a dozen household items valued at more than $160.
“I’m just really sorry that all this is happening and that it happened,” Griswold told Anne Arundel District Court Judge Shaem Spencer before receiving her sentence at the end of a bench trial.
“My intention was clear, I thought, on that day,” she said. “I did not intend on concealing, or taking, or stealing anything. It is not who I am or what I do.”
Prosecutors said that Griswold knowingly and intentionally failed to ring up and pay for items before attempting to leave a Walmart in Severn on March 18.
A security employee from the store said she spotted Griswold on cameras pushing a cart laden with merchandise. From those cameras, the employee said she watched as Griswold failed to ring some items and used a tag from a reusable bag costing less than a dollar to make it appear she was scanning other items.
Defense attorneys countered that a conviction requires that a person knowingly and intentionally act. Griswold’s public defender described the checkout as “chaotic,” with items being scanned and placed on all sides of the register and on the floor and in a second empty cart provided by a store employee.
During her own testimony, Griswold said she was rushing out of the store because of a call about an uncle who had just been admitted to the hospital. Under cross-examination, she told prosecutors that the call came just as she arrived at the self-checkout lane.
Griswold said she remembered telling store security, “God has his way of showing me things and that day it was to slow down.”
Video of the area did not show a phone call. Griswold and her attorney offered no other evidence of a call or hospital admission.
During the cross-examination, prosecutors also attempted to bring in Griswold’s 2024 guilty plea for misconduct in office, but Spencer agreed with the defense to block admission of that information. The judge also said Griswold’s explanation of events lacked credibility, however.
“I’m sworn to uphold the law, but I do not check my common sense at the door,” Spencer said.
Particularly damning to Griswold’s case was a 21-minute video. Spencer watched the video, which showed Griswold with an overflowing cart, completing four separate transactions.
Griswold and her attorney described a chaotic scene that included multiple assists from a store employee during those separate transactions.
Spencer said he saw something else — Griswold scanning items the judge said he believed were lower cost. Then Griswold “concealed” other unscanned items or moved more expensive items into her cart, Spencer said.
The video was not played in open court. Instead, it was described in turns by the judge, a store security guard, and prosecutors.
Spencer silently viewed it twice from the bench using a laptop provided by prosecutors. As he watched, he made notes on a yellow legal pad.
Griswold also viewed a portion of the video — shown to impeach part of her testimonty – from the prosecution’s laptop.
Spencer sentenced Griswold to 6 months in jail but suspended that sentence and added 3 years supervised probation. He also ordered her to pay a fine equal to the value of the merchandise she attempted to steal. (A Walmart employee told the court the items were restocked for sale after they documented them for evidence in the case.)
Griswold expressed concern that her 2024 case cast a cloud over this trial, affecting her sentence, but Spencer cut her off, saying he blocked prosecutors from introducing the case in court and refused to hear details about it.
Griswold has 30 days to appeal Spencer’s ruling.
In the meantime, she also faces the likelihood of going back before the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge who sentenced her last summer.
At the time, Griswold was the county register of wills. She had just pleaded guilty to stealing and cashing a $6,645 check intended to pay estate taxes.
Anne Arundel Circuit Judge Stacy McCormack in July imposed a term of 18 months in prison, but suspended the sentence and tacked on two years of supervised probation. Griswold was immediately removed from office as a result of the plea.
Thursday’s conviction will likely trigger a violation of that sentence and land Griswold back in Circuit Court where she could face additional sanctions, including all or part of the suspended jail term.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/griswold_headshot-1024x910.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 08:02:24.870712

There’s a shared understanding now more than ever that these programs matter, and that they should be available to all students, not just some.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jamie Dansereau: Imagine what’s possible when after-school becomes essential.","This commentary is by Jamie Dansereau of Westminster, director of afterschool and summer programming for West River Education District.If you know me, you know I’m a big dreamer. I’ve never been one to say, “We can’t do that.” Instead, I find myself asking, “How can we make it happen?” And when it comes to after-school programming, that question drives me every single day.After-school programs are where so many young people discover what lights them up, whether it’s doing coding, building a fort in the woods, exploring nature or simply connecting with a caring adult. These hours after the school bell rings are full of possibility. We’re not just filling time, we’re building skills, nurturing passions and expanding futures.And yet, in Vermont and across the country, access to after-school programs isn’t guaranteed. While I’m lucky to be part of a strong community of educators and partners, we still face real challenges: staffing shortages, limited resources and outdated perceptions of after-school as glorified babysitting. Many communities don’t have programs at all.But here’s the good news: the momentum is growing. Governor Phil Scott has made after-school a priority, and organizations like Vermont Afterschool continue to lead the way with vision and heart. There’s a shared understanding now more than ever that these programs matter, and that they should be available to all students, not just some.So where do we go from here?We dream bigger. We imagine a Vermont where after-school is not seen as an “extra,” but as an essential part of education. We build it into our systems, into our budgets and into our everyday understanding of what it means to support the whole child.Think about this: after-school programs create space for students to discover new interests, build meaningful relationships and develop real-world skills that stay with them for life. From hands-on STEAM projects to creative arts, from leadership activities to quiet moments of connection, these programs support the whole child. Every student has the chance to grow, explore, and imagine their future in ways that traditional classroom time simply doesn’t always allow.What if we created a state where every child had that opportunity, every day?We already know that learning doesn’t stop at 3 p.m., and neither should our support. Let’s work together to build a system that reflects the full picture of learning, growth and possibility. Let’s make Vermont a place where after-school isn’t a patchwork of programs, but a promise we make to every child and family.Let’s keep dreaming, and building, a brighter future for Vermont’s students.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jamie Dansereau: Imagine what’s possible when after-school becomes essential.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 08:02:24.870712

(Bill Lucia / Washington State Standard)Voters in Washington will be asked this fall to let the state make stock market investments with payroll taxes collected for its long-term care program.
The Legislature has put a measure on the Nov. 4 ballot to amend the state constitution to allow assets of the program, known as WA Cares Fund, to be handled similarly to pension and retirement accounts. Any earnings would be plowed back into the program.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies. That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds and certificates of deposit that are less risky.
Senate Joint Resolution 8201, which passed by margins of 42-7 in the Senate and 86-9 in the House, would add the Long-Term Services and Supports Trust account to the list of funds exempt from that prohibition alongside the state’s pension and retirement funds.
Voters defeated a similar measure in 2020 by a margin of 54.4% to 45.6%. It passed in only three counties — Jefferson, King, and Whatcom.

Much has changed. For one thing, the program was new, collections of payroll tax hadn’t started and distribution of benefits was years away.
Since mid-2023, a 0.58% tax has been applied on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the program’s benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation.
 As of Dec. 31, 2024, the long-term care account had total assets of $1.64 billion, which are invested by the Washington State Investment Board in line with current guidelines for public money.
Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, the sponsor of the measure in 2020 and this year’s too, said the political environment is much different than five years ago. 
Then, public opposition to the year-old program was strong and the pandemic stirred uncertainty about the stability of the stock market. 
In November, voters defeated an initiative to make WA Cares participation voluntary rather than mandatory for workers, a move that would have effectively ended the program. Braun said that is an indication of a broader endorsement of the program.
He said supporters of the 2020 measure didn’t do a good enough job communicating that the Washington State Investment Board could produce higher earnings on WA Cares Fund assets that would translate into lower premiums and more benefits.
The state investment board uses a long-term, diversified investment strategy. There is a 7% return assumed on dollars invested through the state’s pension accounts, a level set by the Pension Funding Council in 2023.
“We’ll give them another chance and see what they think,” Braun said of voters.
Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Seattle, has been a steadfast opponent. He co-wrote the voter pamphlet argument against the measure in 2020 with Mike Padden, a Republican senator from Spokane Valley who retired from the Legislature last year.
Hasegawa said then that he didn’t want the long-term stability of the trust fund “gambled on by Wall Street.” His position hasn’t changed.
“Look at what’s happened to the stock market,” he said in April. It would be smarter to invest the money in municipal bonds to support public works projects of the local government, he said.
Supporters have formed a coalition, We Care For WA Cares, to make the case that the change will lead to larger investment earnings and greater fiscal stability. Coalition members include the Washington State Nurses Association, Washington Health Care Association, AARP Washington and SEIU 775, a union that represents caregivers.
“We are thrilled to see state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle working together to strengthen WA Cares,” said Cathy Knight, state director for the Washington Association of Area Agencies on Aging.

I’m the general manager at Northstar Canoes, a small manufacturing company in Minnesota, and so far, there’s nothing about President Trump’s policies that are good for either our international or domestic business. 
Our 17 employees make performance canoes out of carbon fiber, aramid and polypropylene. Our canoes are sold throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. We’re not even a blip in the economy, but every passionate paddler knows our boats. We are one of the millions of small businesses that politicians like to call the backbone of the economy during campaign season.
All businesses need a stable political and economic environment to thrive. Administrations on both sides of the aisle, for as long as I can recall, have worked to foster conditions that allow businesses to succeed. 
This administration’s trade wars and attempts to weaken environmental regulations, by contrast, are terrible for our business. 
As a small company, we’ve invested significant resources to develop international markets. The tariffs imposed during the first Trump administration caused retaliatory tariffs to be imposed by both the European Union and Canada, which decreased our sales. To keep our prices competitive, we had to give discounts to our European and Canadian partners, lowering profitability. Which meant less opportunity to expand and support our workers. 
Since the second Trump administration’s policies have taken effect, our international business has come to a halt. The constant uncertainty means our customers don’t even know the actual price they’ll pay when they buy our canoes. And our European distributors are wary of a trade war. From the time they place an order it takes months before the container of canoes arrives at a European port, and our distributors can’t risk that tariffs will be imposed during the lag time. 
On this side of the Atlantic, a large Canadian retailer cancelled nearly his entire order. I inquired what he planned to substitute for our canoes. He replied he’d order from a Canadian brand. When I asked why he hadn’t done so before, he answered that their canoes are lower quality and more expensive.
He explained he couldn’t sell our canoes in the current political environment. In his words, Trump has done more to unite Canadians — conservatives and liberals — than anything in recent history. He explained that even if the tariffs were removed, no one would buy our canoes now because Canadians are boycotting products from the United States. 
When trade opens up again — whether it’s in one year or in four — the customers won’t necessarily come back. Once they’ve established new buying habits, we’ll have to invest more capital to change their purchasing behavior again. What’s infuriating is that we have already invested resources to open those markets. 
The goal of any administration should be to facilitate business, not disrupt it.
Meanwhile, our domestic business is threatened by the Trump administration’s plans to eliminate the environmental review for proposed copper sulfide mines adjacent to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. We build canoes in Minnesota because of the BWCA. More canoes are paddled in the Boundary Waters than anywhere else in the nation. The BWCA has some of the cleanest water in the world — many paddlers drink directly from the lakes.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, hard rock mining is among the biggest emitters of toxic chemicals — such as sulfuric acid, mercury and arsenic — of any industry. Mining companies assure us the toxic chemicals will be contained by tailings dams. But many of these pollutants last hundreds of years. It’s unrealistic to believe a dam can be constructed that will last hundreds of years when the Rapidan Dam on the Blue Earth River recently failed after only 115 years. 
An accidental release into the BWCA would be catastrophic for the environment, and for our business. The release of toxic chemicals into the pristine ecosystem would dramatically reduce BWCA visitation. Longer-term, it would force many BWCA-related businesses to close, while substantially decreasing property values in our region. It is imperative for our business, the economy of northeastern Minnesota, and the country that the BWCA remains permanently protected. 
Between the sloppy rollout of tariffs and bullheaded support for mining without regard to the consequences, the Trump administration is mounting a full-scale assault on our small business. 
You don’t have to look far to find other casualties. 
We elected a businessman. Why doesn’t he behave like one?

(Maddie McGarvey for KFF Health News)For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa, and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school, or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”
  Eric Wunderlin struggled for years to find stable employment due to health issues, bouncing from one minimum-wage job to another around Dayton, Ohio.

Using Health Programs To Encourage Work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women, and disabled people.
Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school, or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.

The Hunt for Results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia, and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives, and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

The country’s top nonpartisan government watchdog has confirmed it is examining the costs of running the nation’s only active Medicaid work requirement program, as Republican state and federal lawmakers consider similar requirements.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office told KFF Health News that its analysis of the Georgia Pathways to Coverage program could be released this fall.
In its first 100 days, the Trump administration has said rooting out waste in federal programs was a priority, allowing billionaire Elon Musk and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency broad latitude to fundamentally alter the operations of federal agencies.
The idea of a nationwide mandate that requires Medicaid enrollees to either work, study, or complete other qualifying activities to maintain coverage is gaining traction as congressional Republicans weigh proposals to cut $880 billion from the federal deficit over 10 years. The savings are intended to offset the costs of President Donald Trump’s priorities, including border security and tax cuts that would largely benefit the wealthy.
A majority of the public — regardless of political leaning — oppose funding cuts to Medicaid, according to polling released May 1 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
The GAO investigation comes at a critical time, said Leo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families.
“Congress seems to be pursuing cuts in Medicaid in a frenetic and rushed manner,” he said. The GAO report could outline for Congress the full extent of problems with work requirements “before they rush forward and do this without thinking.”
The experiences of Georgia and Arkansas — the only two states to have run such programs — show that work requirements depress Medicaid enrollment while adding costly layers of bureaucracy.
Now, more states are trying to get signoff from the Trump administration to approve work requirements for Medicaid, the state-federal program that offers health coverage to millions of Americans with low-incomes and disabilities.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which approves Medicaid pilot programs such as work requirements, did not respond to a request for comment by publication.
The GAO found in 2019 that work requirement programs can be expensive for states to run — hundreds of millions of dollars, in some cases — and that federal officials failed to consider those costs when approving the programs, which cannot increase Medicaid spending.
Still, the Trump administration has supported work requirements. The programs require state employees to manually verify whether enrollees meet eligibility requirements and monitor their continued compliance.
In 2023, more than 90% of U.S. adults eligible for Medicaid expansion were already working or could be exempt from requirements, according to KFF.
During his confirmation hearing to lead CMS, Mehmet Oz said he was in favor of work requirements but didn’t think they should be used as “an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid.”
The first Trump administration approved work requirements in 13 states. Nearly all the programs were blocked by the Biden administration or federal courts.
Georgia is one of 10 states that hasn’t fully expanded Medicaid to nearly all low-income adults.
The state launched Pathways to Coverage on July 1, 2023. It’s been a main policy priority of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, whose office engaged in a lengthy court fight with the Biden administration after it tried to block the program.
The program cost more than $57 million in state and federal dollars through the end of 2024, with much of that going toward its administration. As of April 25, 7,410 people were enrolled, a small percentage of those who would be covered by a full Medicaid expansion. Pathways has also slowed processing times for other benefit programs in the state.
When asked about the costs and benefits of Pathways, Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas instead pointed to Georgia’s recently launched state-based Obamacare exchange. It saw record enrollment due, in part, to enhanced subsidies passed by the Biden administration.
“We are covering more Georgians than traditional Medicaid expansion would have, and for less money,” said Douglas, referring to the state, not federal, share of spending.
The enhanced subsidies that boosted enrollment are set to expire this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending them would cost the federal government about $335 billion over 10 years.
In March, Arkansas asked the Trump administration to relaunch its Medicaid work requirement program. The federal public comment period on the program runs through May 10. A previous version was halted by a court order in 2019, but not before more than 18,000 lost coverage in less than a year.
Georgia plans to request that the White House renew its program with modest changes, including reducing how frequently enrollees must prove to the state they’re working or engaging in other qualifying activities.
The GAO investigation into Georgia’s work requirement program comes after three Democratic U.S. senators — Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Ron Wyden of Oregon — asked the GAO in December for an investigation into the program’s costs. Their request cited reporting by KFF Health News.
“I pushed for this GAO report because I am confident its findings will further support what we already know: Pathways to Coverage costs the taxpayers more money and covers fewer people than had the state simply joined 40 other states in closing the health care coverage gap,” Warnock said in a statement.
The GAO said it aims to figure out how much Georgia has spent to run the program, how much of that was federal money, and how that spending is being tracked.

(Getty Images)Sweeping changes to how the state’s public universities manage faculty tenure and campus governance were quietly folded into Indiana’s 2025 budget bill during the final hours of the legislative session despite limited lawmaker debate — and without opportunities for public input.
That’s in addition to other unorthodox provisions slipped into the state’s next two-year spending plan, like language to give Gov. Mike Braun total say over who sits on Indiana University’s Board of Trustees.
Braun has until May 6 to take action on the budget. If he does nothing, the plan automatically becomes law and takes effect July 1.
The new postsecondary rules require faculty at public colleges and universities to post their syllabi online and mandate “productivity” reviews for tenured professors.
Authority of faculty-led governing bodies was reduced, as well.










There’s been ongoing discussion about the efficiency in higher education, and that’s always a fair discussion as to how we maximize the use of taxpayer dollars.


– Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton


Faculty senates, for example, which are traditionally responsible for shaping a school’s academic policy, will now be limited to an advisory role. More authority will instead shift to university trustees and administrative leadership.
Republican supermajority leadership maintained the changes are necessary and defended using the budget as a vehicle bill.
House budget architect Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, said the language was added because universities, like the rest of state government, need to slim spending.
The two-year budget cuts funding for the state’s public colleges by 5%.
“There’s been ongoing discussion about the efficiency in higher education, and that’s always a fair discussion as to how we maximize the use of taxpayer dollars,” Thompson said. “That’s an ongoing discussion. That’s one of our responsibilities.”
But Democrat Rep. Matt Pierce said the move was rushed and unvetted. 
 Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, speaks from the floor on April 25, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“We didn’t think we needed to hear from the public, or maybe even, heaven forbid, some faculty members or people who run universities, to kind of understand how they think this provision might work or not work. Would that not have been helpful?” Pierce, of Bloomington, asked Thompson on the House floor shortly before the session concluded.
Thompson reiterated that university governance “is a fiscal issue,” and that “sometimes, we make these decisions based on the information we have in front of us.”
Pierce and other Democrats disagreed, noting that the higher education provisions were not previously approved by either the House or Senate chambers, nor were they introduced or debated in other bills or amendments earlier in the session.
Faculty advocates further warned that the changes could threaten academic freedom and deter top scholars from staying in or coming to Indiana.
“The public is left to wonder, who put the supermajority on this track? Who is behind the scenes that has the influence to change decades, if not centuries, of the operation of universities?” Pierce questioned.
“All this crazy stuff … undermining faculty governance, treating them like they’re children, and every five years they’ve got to prove they’re doing their job,” he continued. “Those faculty — the best faculty, the researchers, the people who are searching for cures for cancer, the people learning about and understanding nanotechnology, the people who are going to solve the challenges of our day with science and investigation and inquiry — they’re out of here. They’re not going to put up with this.”
More changes to faculty tenure
Once the budget bill becomes law, all tenured professors at Indiana’s public colleges and universities must undergo formal “productivity reviews” at least once every five years.
Bill language specifies that evaluations should “measure” a professor’s “productivity,” which includes: 

the faculty member’s teaching workload;
the total number of graduate and undergraduate students taught by the faculty member;
the time spent on instructional assignments and overseeing graduate students; and
the research and creative scholarship productivity of the faculty member.

Institutions will be required to place faculty on probation if they do not meet the standards set through the review process. According to the legislation, that probation “may result in dismissal.”

The new review system is reminiscent of a law approved by the General Assembly and former Gov. Eric Holcomb in 2024 that seeks to promote “intellectual diversity” on Indiana campuses.
Boards of trustees decide what qualifies as “intellectual diversity,” although the term has been championed by Republican lawmakers who contend that conservative students and faculty members are increasingly ostracized at progressively liberal college and university settings — or at least perceive such shunning.
Under the law adopted last year, both nontenured and tenured faculty are judged on whether — and to what extent — they’ve delivered intellectually “diverse” instruction. University trustees are allowed to decide punishments for professors who fail to meet their school’s standards.
Boards are required to deny promotions and tenure to faculty members if, “based on past performance or other determination by the board,” they are “unlikely to foster … intellectual diversity.” Additionally, “intellectual diversity” must be considered in post-tenure reviews, which are now required at least every five years.
Governance changes on the way
Colleges’ governance groups, like faculty senates and councils, will also be relegated to “advisory only” roles.
Those bodies traditionally make decisions around faculty hiring and promotion processes, in addition to curricula and other academic policies.
Elected faculty groups will be able to recommend and vote on changes to key matters, but final authority will rest with university trustees and top administrators.
Indiana University alumni blast board of trustees changes slipped into state budget

Other budget provisions order public colleges and universities to regularly review their degree programs and either cut those that fall beneath a certain enrollment threshold, or get state approval to continue offering the programs. 
Schools could also be required to cut degrees that fail to meet the state’s standards for “quality, viability, and productivity.”
Chris Lowery, Indiana’s higher education commissioner, told lawmakers in April that his commission had already adopted provisions to “approve and disapprove” proposed or existing credentials offered by Indiana’s post-secondaries. There are roughly 3,400 programs currently offered by school statewide. Lowery wasn’t sure how many programs could — or should — be cut.
“I don’t know what the number is, but what we know in any sector, when you get to that high of a quantity, you should be asking and questioning, ‘Are we giving value to our fellow Hoosiers?’ … We have work to do there,” he said before the House Education Committee last month. “Although our colleges are doing a great job to prepare students for in-demand career opportunities … it’s clear the number is too large here, and we can simply be more efficient and effective with outcomes.”
Another section of the budget bill specifically calls out Indiana University by eliminating alumni input in the selection of university trustees. It instead gives decision-making power over the board’s membership to Braun.
Under current law, Indiana’s governor appoints five members to IU’s board and picks one student representative with the help of a student-led committee. Three other members must be IU graduates and are elected by other alumni.
The new state budget mandates all nine members to be appointed by the governor, and gives the executive leader the ability to, “at any time,” remove and replace a board member who was previously elected by the IU alumni.
Braun defended the policy move Wednesday, emphasizing that just a “fraction” of IU alumni participated in past votes to elect trustees.

Colorado had a 4.5% increase in births last year, the largest in the nation, as births increased nationally for the first time since 2021. (Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.


Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Courtesy of the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment)Larry Bengal was on a mission.
His target? The band playing during the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact’s annual meeting, which was in Arkansas in 2003. More specifically, a member of that band: Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.
“I told my wife, ‘Let’s go up and meet Gov. Huckabee,’ because he was playing with his band, Capitol Offense, at the time,” Bengal said. 
As Bengal reached out to shake the governor’s hand, Huckabee jumped off the stage.
“I thought, ‘This is really great, Arkansas is a friendly place,’” Bengal said. 
Instead of shaking his hand, Huckabee walked past Bengal and helped his wife who had slipped on the dance floor and was lying “flat on her back.”
“My first words to the governor, who I would end up working for two years later, were, ‘She hasn’t been drinking, governor,’” Bengal said. “He was a Baptist preacher, so I thought, ‘Oh, I gotta say something.’” 
The incident must not have left a poor impression on Huckabee who in 2005 named Bengal director of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, a position he held for 20 years before handing it over to his successor, Allen York, last month. While Bengal remained the state’s chief energy administrator, he passed on that title as well Wednesday, his official retirement date.
“I am extremely pleased with my time; I’ll be retiring here in Arkansas,” Bengal said.
Possessing a deep knowledge of the oil and gas industry that many at the Department of Energy and Environment and beyond have praised, Bengal came to Arkansas after stints in the private sector and then as the director of the Illinois equivalent of the AOGC. 
During his two decades as director, he oversaw pivotal moments in the state’s oil and gas sector, such as the rise and fall of the Fayetteville Shale play, and more recently, the growing push to source lithium directly from salty brines deep underground in south Arkansas. 
He also studied well-induced seismicity — earthquakes caused by deep injection wells — served as a representative to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact and testified before Congress.
Reaching for the stars
While Bengal’s career focused on the earth and what lies within it, he was inspired by programs created for the sake of reaching the stars. 
“In the ‘60s, when Russia was putting up Sputnik and we were behind in the space program, President [John F.] Kennedy, as we all know, made a pledge to go to the moon by the end of the decade,” Bengal said. “He also started science projects around the country because we were way behind, everyone thought, in science and technology. And one of the programs that he started was called the Earth Science Curriculum Project, which was a federal program to teach earth science to high schoolers.”
Various high schools around the country were selected for the program, Bengal said, including his own in Philadelphia. 
“At 15 years old, I took that course and fell in love with geology. So I’ve only ever wanted to be a geologist,” Bengal said.
He attended the University of Wisconsin, earned his bachelors degree and then started a decades-long career in geology, oil and gas, although he started as a geologist at a time where coal dominated the energy industry. 
“Back in the ‘70s, when I started, coal was king,” Bengal recalled. “We were running out of gas, and I started my career because the country wanted to make gas out of coal.”
He spent several years in Illinois, working for its geological survey and then later for its oil and gas regulator. 
Fayetteville fracking
Reflecting on his career in an interview last month, Bengal said the Fayetteville Shale stood out in his mind as one of the defining aspects of his career. He wrote many of the rules promulgated by the commission during his tenure, including some of the first regulations in the country to regulate hydraulic fracturing (better known as fracking) fluids, after public concern about chemicals and pollution from the practice of extracting natural gas grew louder and louder.
Fracking, by his explanation, had been happening for decades prior to the natural gas boom earlier this century, just never at that scale. Bengal said the massive amounts of fluid and chemicals getting pumped into the ground as a result was why fracking had “captured the public interest.”
“The public really was inundated with all sorts of, I guess, misinformation and horror stories of what was happening with hydraulic fracturing, that it was contaminating the water” Bengal said. “All of this [fracking] was happening at such depths that that was not the case.”
The interest in fracking made it, and Arkansas by extension, a worldwide issue.
However, there were examples in other areas of the country where a defective well “had caused an issue” — although Bengal said those were “small in extent” — so states had to take action to “allay those fears and show that it was done safely.”
The commission’s work during the play was also crucial in preparing it for the next big rush, Bengal said, this time for lithium.
“Fortunately for Arkansas, we’ve already learned some of those lessons in brine production because we already have a brine statute; I think we’re the only state that has a brine statute,” he said. “We’ve learned to be diligent in trying to understand issues before we knee-jerk a solution.” 
Bengal said he feels “fortunate and blessed” to have worked on the development of the Fayetteville Shale and lithium, as well as the challenges of dealing with earthquakes.   
“You don’t get an opportunity much to deal with new things and be involved in the development of solutions to address those new things,” he said. “I feel very fortunate that I was able to be in Arkansas and be involved in so much of that development.”
While Bengal may be retiring, he’s not going far. 
In an emailed statement congratulating the man her father hired 20 years ago, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she would be appointing Bengal as an AOGC commissioner.
“Congratulations to Larry Bengal on an incredible 20 years at the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission,” Sanders said. “We trusted Larry to help build up Arkansas’ modern oil and gas industry. And more recently, we’ve happily leaned on him to develop the lithium industry in South Arkansas, which is why I am proud to appoint him as a member to the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission to continue his great work.”

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Editor of the Indiana Capital Chronicle Niki Kelly recently shared why the end of the legislative session is her least favorite season. Kelly wonders why the democratic processes that are embraced throughout most of the session are thrown out at the end, particularly through amendments with new or unpopular bill language. However, we argue that this is not just an end of session issue or a shortcoming of the current crop of state legislators, it is by design. This institutional arrangement largely shuts out the very people it claims to represent – the people.
We have a deeper understanding of this concept after we were fortunate enough to team-teach a course, Applied Political Philosophy, at the University of Indianapolis. By training, one of us is a political scientist (Shufeldt) and the other a philosopher (Davidson).
Lawmakers and their terrible, horrible, no good, very bad end of session

Our students started by reading political philosophy, including works from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, John Stuart Mill, Isaiah Berlin, and John Rawls. We encouraged them to think about what gives the government its legitimacy, the appropriate uses of power, and what constitutes a compelling government interest. In a democracy, many of these ideas revolve around the idea of the “consent of the governed.”
To apply these ideas, students tracked and analyzed bills throughout the legislative session. They were free to pick any legislation they wanted and were encouraged to identify bills they supported or opposed. We did not impose any restrictions or parameters – their selected bills ranged from relatively obscure (but important) to more controversial, contentious pieces of legislation (like House Bill 1393 or Senate Bill 10).
Like our students, any Hoosier can track legislation to better understand the legislative process. The IGA website has vastly improved over the years allowing citizens to watch committee hearings or discussion in the House or Senate. Our students were able to report on the progress of their bills from the comfort of their dorm rooms. The website is relatively up-to-date, giving everyday citizens the ability to see vote outcomes, a schedule for each day, and current bill language and amendments. Moreover, the media landscape in Indianapolis – in no small part thanks to nonprofit newsrooms like the Indiana Capital Chronicle – allows citizens to stay informed about what is happening at the statehouse.
 Transparency doesn’t make participation easier
However, being informed and being able to participate in democracy are not the same. Indiana has what political scientists call a “citizen” or part-time legislature. Session began in January and recently concluded. This part-time calendar has a host of consequences – it affects who is able to serve (especially young people), it artificially speeds up aspects of the legislative process, and leads to large, omnibus pieces of legislation covering far too many topics alongside the inclusion of unpopular ideas without being vetted by committees, but perhaps most problematically – it makes it more difficult for everyday citizens to play a role in the legislative process.
We equipped our students with the knowledge they need to engage in citizen lobbying. We led them through the process of scheduling a meeting: sending an introductory email, making daily follow-up phone calls, and looking out for legislators once we arrived at the statehouse. Of our seventeen students, fourteen were able to have at least one meeting with an elected official (or their legislative assistant) on their own or to join a classmate in their meeting, and we are eternally grateful to the elected officials who took time to speak with our students.

However, the casual relationship with time at the state capitol shuts out everyday voters. Many students lamented the near radio silence in response to their repeated emails and phone calls, the frequent last-minute cancellations or hours-long delays, and double-booked appointments. The typical voter cannot be at the capitol all day, every day, just to have a five minute meeting with an elected official meant to represent their concerns. Without paid lobbyists, citizens are less able to catch last minute amendments or previously thought-to-be dead bill language that gets revived, nor can they afford to wait a few more hours until the legislator is “free” to meet. While our students at UIndy benefit from being a ten-minute drive to the state capitol, Hoosiers traveling from each of the four corners of the state may miss their opportunity for their voices to be heard.
Making space to hear everyday people is not the sole responsibility of individual elected officials. The limited availability of legislators is an institutional failure–one that arises from the design of the assembly and calendar rather than only the individual choices of legislators. Whether students agreed with their legislator or supported the outcome of a bill, a healthy democracy requires citizen involvement, and the institutions must be designed in ways that support this engagement.
Getting shut out of the process and seeing the IGA in action has led some of our students to grow more pessimistic – threatening to lower Indiana’s already abysmal rates of voter participation. For some students, gaining the “tools necessary to feel empowered to change government” (according to their reflections) only made them more committed to the process . Regardless of any individual student’s reaction, the Indiana General Assembly must address the institutional barriers that shut out everyday citizens – they work for us, afterall.

The annual protest brought union organizers, immigrant rights advocates, Indigenous community activists, students from across Wisconsin and other members of the public together to make a stand against the policies of President Donald Trump.
Despite rainy weather, hundreds of participants turned out for Milwaukee’s May Day march, with another protest planned in Madison on Friday. Prior to the march, the morning began with prayers and words from community leaders. Mark Denning, a member of the Oneida Nation, said to the crowd on Thursday that “all prayer goes to the same place” and that “all creation stories are true.” Denning said, “as we stand here together under this sheltering sky that’s giving us this beautiful rain…I want to share that your ancestors are forever. Your future is forever.”

“Natives stand as a lesson to each and every one of you that the injustices of the past cannot be the injustices of the future,” said Denning, calling himself “a remnant of the wars that have been done on my people” and the May Day marchers “a remnant of the wars that must be corrected.” Denning went on to tell the crowd “you are now of this place! You are now of this land, and of these waters! And you will not be denied because this is where your children will be born and have a future!” The crowd cheered in response.
Although the May 1 march for immigrant workers’ rights is an annual tradition in Milwaukee, this year brought with it a new sense of fear buffered by local determination. Waves of arrests have swept communities nationwide, populating social media feeds with images of immigrants and  international students detained by masked, plain-clothes federal agents.
In Milwaukee, local advocates recently learned that agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have been paying visits to the homes of sponsors of unaccompanied immigrant minors, causing fear of possible deportations. After ICE raids at the Milwaukee County Courthouse provoked outrage, Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and accused of obstructing federal agents who arrived outside her courtroom to arrest a man appearing for a hearing. Protests erupted the weekend after Dugan was arrested, building momentum leading up to the May Day march.

Milwaukee marchers  joined a larger network of groups organizing May Day protests in at least 32 states. Rain showers came and went as the marchers traversed the city. People of all ages came out, including  high school students and their young siblings and grey-haired elders. Different sections of the march had different chants and atmospheres. Palestinian flags waved in the breeze alongside American flags (some of which were upside down), Mexican flags, LGBTQ+ flags, and numerous other banners. Milwaukee police officers escorted the demonstration on motorcycles and bicycles, while unmarked surveillance vans patrolled  the perimeter. 
Within an hour, the marchers arrived at Zeidler Union Square Park in the downtown area. Gathering around a central pavilion, the crowd listened to Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, who said people had come from as far away as Arcadia in Trempealeau County to be part of the event. “We know that when we unite we are stronger, and we can achieve what seems impossible,” said Neumann-Ortiz.

Speakers called for the charges to be dropped against Dugan, for ICE to stay out of local courts, for constitutional rights to be defended and for people to take a stand against fear. Missy Zombor, president of the Milwaukee Public School Board, said that the school district is ready to honor and fight for the ideals and sense of hope that her own grandparents sought when they immigrated to America. 
Zombor said that the school district will honor its safe haven resolution. “Our schools are and will always be safe havens for children,” she said, “regardless of their background, their immigration status, their identity, or their circumstance.” The Milwaukee Public School District, Zombor said, is strengthened by the diverse languages, cultures and backgrounds of  the student body, which includes many student activists. “Our schools are going to continue to promote a curriculum that gives students the knowledge and power to question the world in a way that helps students uproot the causes of racism and inequality,” said Zombor. “Our schools are going to teach the next generation of change-makers.” 
Former Milwaukee judge Jim Gramling Jr. called Dugan’s arrest “a very unfortunate and very dangerous thing.” Gramling said that the unusual, public arrest of a judge at the courthouse “was clearly designed to intimidate other judges and those who seek justice in our courts.” He added  that federal authorities had a week to invite Dugan into the U.S. Attorney’s Office to discuss the case. Instead, Gramling said, “they wanted a public display to embarrass her, to humiliate her, and to intimidate others in the justice system from resolving immigration matters.”

Gramling stressed that judges need to be free of pressure from outside influences, so that they can decide cases based on the facts before them. “And yet we have a president who’s threatening the firing of judges, because of decisions that he doesn’t like,” said Gramling. “And now we have a judge treated like a common criminal by that president’s agents.” Dugan is a long-time and respected member of the community, Gramling said, having served in  leadership roles at local non-profits  and that she doesn’t deserve what’s happened to her. 
Milwaukee student activists also spoke, saying that student voices should not be stifled, and that free speech means little when young people fear retaliation. The students called for Milwaukee police officers to be taken out of Milwaukee Public Schools. Removing school resources officers was a decision made by the school board after years of student organizing. But the state Legislature has demanded that Milwaukee return police to schools as a condition of state aid.

Immigration operations add a new layer of fear for students who already dread the return of school resource officers. Milwaukee police have a standard operating procedure which limits the department’s  involvement in immigration matters, stating that “proactive immigration enforcement by local police can be detrimental to our mission and policing philosophy when doing so deters some individuals from participating in their civic obligation to assist the police.” 
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) students joined the May Day march, denouncing ICE and encouraging people to stand in solidarity with immigrants. “Don’t let fear imprison you in the shadows,” one student said from the stage. “Join us. We will keep each other safe.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2408-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 07:03:12.183847

How bad is it?  Well, the Department of Environmental Quality just approved yet another application for a 45-condo development using septic systems within a quarter mile of the already-hammered river.  Mind you, this is after the Gallatin was formally declared “impaired” last year due to nutrient overload which now feeds the neon green algae blooms in this once gin-clear river downstream from Big Sky.  
The state agency is obviously ignoring the fact that putting even more nutrients in the Gallatin will only exacerbate its “impaired” status — the exact opposite of what “regulatory” agencies are supposed to do to uphold Montanans’ “inalienable right to a clean and healthful environment” (according to the state’s constitution, Article II, Section 3), as well as the constitutional mandate that “the state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.” (Article IX, Section 1)
It’s tough to find any other interpretation of those plain language constitutional guarantees than if there’s already an environmental pollution problem, the onus is on the state to “maintain and improve” the environment, not approve and allow even more pollution.  
Gov. Greg Gianforte, a religious man, swore an oath on the Bible to uphold the Constitution — but that obviously doesn’t mean much when the big money at Big Sky wants yet more overdevelopment and more pollution.   
This is the second phase of the Quarry development which, as reported by Brett French, wants “136 single-family condos, 130 multifamily condos and 11 mixed-use buildings.”  Yet, that’s just a tiny fraction of the 1,354 additional homes the Big Sky Resort Area District says it will need in the next three years as housing for their underpaid workers.
What’s even more shocking is the fact this decision comes only days after the release of a hydrogeologic study by Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology that compared the undeveloped side of the Gallatin with the Big Sky side.  Their conclusion?  The aquifer is “shallow, unconfined, and vulnerable to contamination.”  In other words, the septic effluent has a short trip from the drain field to the aquifer to the Gallatin. 
In the meantime, DEQ is claiming that most of the nitrogen polluting the Gallatin is “natural” — and that septic effluent is only a minor input.  Which begs the question: How was it possible that the Gallatin ran clear and clean for thousands of years before Big Sky, the Yellowstone Club, and the ever-growing cluster of real estate developments started dumping their waste on the mountain and in the river? 
It’s no mystery where the nutrients causing the algae blooms are coming from — and no, it’s not from the bison in Yellowstone National Park.  It’s from the pollution emanating from this bizarre enclave of the wealthy stuffed into a narrow canyon with nowhere for their waste to go but down to the Gallatin.
In short, what we’re seeing is an abject failure of Montana’s so-called “environmental regulatory” agency — aided and abetted by the Gallatin County Commissioners who, when the rich say “jump,” they jump to approve.  
As for a “clean and healthy environment for present and future generations of Montanans” — without enforcement that prescient mandate of our Constitution is just words on paper as the Gallatin River cries “mayday, mayday, mayday” to deaf ears.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gallatin-River-Green.jpg,,,2025-05-02 07:03:12.183847

“The big takeaway is, number one, our objective is to save it,” Fulcher said of Medicaid. “… And I think we’re going to get there. Number two: our objective is to keep the benefits intact for everybody it was intended for. And I think we’re going to get there.”
Asked what he meant by Medicaid’s intended population, Fulcher described what Medicaid enrollment looked like before the Affordable Care Act prompted all but 10 states to expand Medicaid.
“Disabled people, elderly people who truly need the health care, and they don’t have any other channel to get it. And that’s what Medicaid was designed for. And we’re trying to make sure that that remains intact,” he said.
But Fulcher pushed back on what he called misinformation about congressional Medicaid spending cut plans, naming U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, and U.S.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, who recently visited Idaho for a rally.
“I know exactly where they’re coming from, and they would like to see a universal health care system. And there was a big push to make Medicaid that vehicle — and it was just never designed for that,” Fulcher said.
“If you’re working-age, able-bodied, I think that there’s a reasonable chance that that’s going to change. But at the same time, I would say there’s some fairness in there too, because that was really never what was envisioned with the program. It’s just the expansion population included everybody, and there was never any discussion for a funding mechanism,” Fulcher said. “So shame on all of us for letting that happen.”
But not all of the House’s planned cuts need to come from Medicaid, he said. One of the first places the committee will look is to end mandates for electric vehicles and green energy, which he said could combine to well over $100 billion alone.

 Federal Medicaid cuts being considered by Republicans in U.S. Congress

For Medicaid, several savings options are on the table, Fulcher said, like:
Medicaid work requirements for “working-age, able-bodied people.” That could also come with a range of exceptions, Fulcher said, like for people with disabilities or who are medically frail, Native American tribe members, people under the age of 19, people over the age of 64, and people in school or training. There might also be hardship waivers, he said, targeted to counties with higher unemployment rates.
“If we simply employ that — which, frankly, I think is warranted, because it was never intended for the working age, able-bodied, ever — then you might get the rest of the way,” Fulcher told the Sun. “We very well may get the rest of the way of the savings target we’re trying to hit.”
Rule changes for noncitizens and people enrolled in Medicaid in several states at the same time. (In Idaho, noncitizens do not qualify for Medicaid generally. But they can qualify for emergency services paid by Medicaid.)
Cutting states’ higher matching rate for Medicaid expansion hasn’t been discussed — yet, Fulcher said.

“I’m not saying it’s not going to be. But that’s not discussed yet. And I think part of the reason why is we want to know how much savings we think we can get” in other ways, Fulcher said.
But any federal cuts to Medicaid expansion match rates could have ripple effects that could force states into tough decisions about whether to continue Medicaid expansion. Here’s how:

If the feds cut their Medicaid expansion match rate, Medicaid expansion in nine states would automatically be repealed, based on trigger laws in those states, according to Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families.
In Idaho, cutting the federal match rate for Medicaid expansion would either: Trigger a review by the Idaho Legislature when it is in session based on one law, or allow the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare director to use broad program cut powers recently given to him by a new state law.
Here’s how the federal match rate works: The federal government covers 90% of a state’s Medicaid expansion costs, through the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. That’s significantly higher than the typical Medicaid federal matching rate, which is adjusted each year based on states’ economic performance. Idaho usually gets 70% of its non-expansion Medicaid costs covered by the federal government.

Provider taxes are a complex process states use to get additional federal Medicaid funds, Fulcher explained. Typically hospitals are taxed some amount that states claim as a Medicaid expense to get additional federal funds. In Idaho, it’s called the hospital assessment tax. Across the nation, Fulcher said provider taxes account for about $600 billion.
“That was never intended for that to be the process. And so this provider tax issue has really turned into kind of a milking of the federal system. And we don’t know how much of that is really going for care, and just how much that is going to other expenses for hospitals,” Fulcher said. “We just don’t know. It might all be legitimate.”
A long way out: Fulcher stressed the U.S. House’s process to find spending cuts is just starting, and that Congress is likely months away from passing bills for cuts.
The U.S. House and Senate have passed competing budget cut plans, and both need to reconcile their differences for policies to pass both chambers.
“The current budget resolution goes through the end of September. And frankly, I think we’re going to chew up all that time. Because what’s likely to happen is our committee is going to come up with something, and it will pass the House. And then the Senate is — their committees are going to come up with something else. It’s going to pass the Senate. And then we’re going to grind it up between the two,” Fulcher said. “So this is a long long way, I think, from fruition.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After debate that spilled into three days, Nebraska lawmakers on Thursday advanced a bundle of “public safety” proposals highlighted by a contentious provision to lower the age at which a Nebraska youth can be detained — to 11 years old.
The age drop was backed by Gov. Jim Pillen and originally included in a bill by Ralston State Sen. Merv Riepe, which did not fully make it out of committee but did, in part, emerge in the bundle now known as Legislative Bill 530.

Segments of at least nine bills were folded into the megabill before the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee moved it to the floor for full debate. Lawmakers advanced it 33-0, with 16 senators marking present not voting, to move the package to final reading.
The vote came after committee chair, Lincoln State Sen. Carolyn Bosn, agreed to continue negotiations with Democratic lawmakers who view the juvenile justice elements as overly punitive. Several have said prevention and rehabilitation services are more effective when dealing with young people whose brains are still developing.
“It costs more to imprison our kids,” said State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha. “Juveniles have the most chance for rehabilitation … We should be investing in resources and not detaining fifth graders.”
 Threads the needle 

Bosn, a former prosecutor, views the overall package as one that promotes public safety and better re-directs juveniles who have veered into trouble.
“The public has the right to feel safe in their communities while juveniles also have the right to be set up for success. I think this threads that needle perfectly.”
While the Riepe proposal to reduce the minimum detention age from 13 to 11 stirred the most objection, the Ralston lawmaker noted that another previously contentious element was not included in the larger package. That piece would have lowered the age at which a teen could be charged as an adult for serious felonies, from 14 to 12.

He reiterated his stance that the younger age was necessary due to a rise in serious violent offenses by younger kids, and said he relied on information from the Douglas County sheriff and attorney. The goal, Riepe said, is to “intercept a cycle, step in before it’s too late.”
State Sen. Terrell McKinney said juvenile crime has gone down overall. He said the Omaha mayor has campaigned on less crime in the city. “Where’s the research, where’s the data?” he asked Riepe.
Riepe’s LB 556, during a March 13 public hearing, garnered support from a Pillen representative and seven others, while 28 testified in opposition. In addition, 115 wrote in opposition while two people  submitted letters of support.
 Advocates decry package 

Thursday’s vote prompted a statement from the ACLU of Nebraska, Voices for Children and RISE, which supports people transitioning out of incarceration. The groups criticized amendments that expanded felony offenses as well as the proposed drop in the minimum age for detention. 
They noted that among the reasons a preteen could be detained, under the proposed legislation, is if the youth exhibited signs of self-harm.











Detention facilities are not mental health or healthcare facilities or safe havens. Our children deserve better.”


– Jasmine Harris of RISE



“Expanding felonies, harshening penalties and detaining children as young as 11 will not build safer or stronger communities,” said Jason Witmer, policy fellow with the ACLU Nebraska. “LB 530 is very clearly still a step backward on smart criminal and juvenile justice policy.”
Jasmine Harris, director of public policy at RISE, said preteens should be receiving attention that addresses underlying mental, behavioral and environmental conditions that put them in touch with the juvenile justice system.
“Detention facilities are not mental health or healthcare facilities or safe havens,” she said in a statement. “Our children deserve better.”
 ‘Super predator’ group  

Spivey sought unsuccessfully to strike a few provisions in the package — including one she said demonized Black youth — but said she was hopeful negotiations would continue with Judiciary Committee leaders before the final lawmaking step.

Among her failed amendments was one to eliminate creation of a “high-risk juvenile probationer” category that Spivey said would be viewed as a “super predator” group. She said it would open the door to harsher sentencing and disproportionate harm to youths of color. 
Another part of LB 684 that remained despite Spivey’s protest requires the Office of Probation to generate a list of all juveniles on probation in each county by the first day of the month and then provide it to each law enforcement agency in that county.
“It is unnecessary over-surveillance of those young people,” she said, adding that law enforcement already has access to such information.
Spivey was able to garner enough votes to stop the elevation of a penalty if a youth on probation tampers with the young person’s  electronic monitoring device. Spivey said the offense would, for now, remain a misdemeanor versus a felony.

State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha criticized the package as “logrolling” questionably related bills that were too wide-ranging. He said it creates confusion for constituents, who might wonder why their elected official doesn’t support a certain program that is wrapped up in the package.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha introduced the underlying LB 530 as “public safety” legislation that aims partly to raise fines for speeding violations and to change the law to help “vulnerable road users.” 
 Package components 

Among other bills folded into the package:
LB 6, introduced by Bosn and aimed at fentanyl poisoning, calls for enhanced penalties when the person using the controlled substance dies or sustains serious injury. 
LB 44, by McKinney, allows individuals to file for post-conviction relief up until the age of 21 if the conviction occurred as a minor.
LB 124, by State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, would match a drunken driver’s penalty for motor vehicle homicide of an unborn child to the penalty that drunken driver would get for motor vehicle homicide.
LB 395, by State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, would allow police access to a sealed juvenile record when someone applies for a concealed handgun permit.
 LB 404, by State Sen. Robert Hallstrom of Syracuse, authorizes courts to extend a term of probation upon a joint application from the probation officer and the person on probation. 
LB 600, by State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, authorizes the Department of Transportation to temporarily reduce speed limits on highways under specific conditions such as adverse weather or a traffic congestion. 
LB 684, by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, was essentially gutted and replaced by a series of juvenile justice measures, including the lowering of the age at which a youth could be detained in a facility. Bosn said the Judiciary Committee sees the measures as ways to “improve accountability for juveniles and transparency for law enforcement.” Spivey said the measures were among the most concerning in the package.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The Examiner has not been able to confirm the authenticity of the email, but WISN News, the ABC affiliate in Milwaukee, reported that two Wisconsin judges confirmed to the station that they had received it from Isham. In the email, Isham allegedly said she would  refuse to appear in  court unless she received “guidance” and “support” concerning the presence and permissible activities of ICE agents. 
Over the weekend of April 26-27, right-wing media outlets obtained and shared the email they claimed Isham sent to other judges.
On Monday and Tuesday Isham appeared in court via Zoom.
There is also  added security in the court, and a Sawyer County Deputy told the Wisconsin Examiner there had been a threat to a judge.

Isham was elected in November 2023 to the newly created Branch 2 court in an uncontested race. She is a member of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and is the first female and first Native American judge in Sawyer County and only the second Native American circuit court judge in Wisconsin.
In the email, Isham reportedly noted she had sworn an oath of support to the U.S. and the Wisconsin constitutions. She also reportedly added that  Judge Dugan was standing by her oath of office when she confronted ICE officers who came to her courtroom in Milwaukee and escorted the defendant they’d come to arrest out a side door. 
“Yesterday, Judge Hannah Dugan of Milwaukee County stood on her Oath in the very building she swore to uphold it and she was arrested and charged with felonies for it. Enough is enough,” the email message said.
“I have no intention of allowing anyone to be taken out of my courtroom by ICE and sent to a concentration camp, especially without due process as BOTH of the constitutions we swore to support requires. Should I start raising ball money?”
Criticism of Isham
Isham’s reported threat to not hold court out of concern about interactions with ICE agents drew criticism from three northern Wisconsin Republican legislators who represent Sawyer County.
Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany said Isham should resign.
“Monica Isham is choosing to protect illegal aliens over the law,” Tiffany wrote on X. “She should resign or be removed.”
State Sen. Romaine Quinn and state Rep. Chanz Green,  issued a joint statement: “Wisconsin’s Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to uphold the integrity of the judiciary. It further states that ‘a judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.’
“Judge Isham’s threat to close court certainly does not promote public confidence in our court system or uphold the integrity of her position as a public official in this state. It is a disservice to the residents of Sawyer County.”
In their joint statement, Quinn and Green note that there had been an intensive effort to expand Sawyer County’s court to the second branch, which was officially recognized in 2023, and they go on to say that if Isham will not exercise her duties, then she should resign.
The Republican Party chair for the 7th CD, Jim Miller, who is also the president of the Hayward City Council, said he has empathy for Judge Isham for saying in the email that she had faced racism in her courtroom.
“That’s sad that she’s had to face that,” said Miller. “If that were my court and I faced racism, I would have held those people in contempt of court.”
However, Miller said that Isham’s threat not to hold court was drawing the ire of many people he had talked to.
“That does not sit well with people because they expect her to be a public servant,” said Miller. “If she is going to get a paycheck, she should come in and do her job. You can’t just boycott working as a public servant. It doesn’t work that way.”
Isham has so far continued to hold court via Zoom. 
Miller is also critical of Isham reportedly mentioning those detained by ICE would be sent to a “concentration camp.”
“My recommendation would be for her to at least clarify or maybe apologize for that statement, because that’s a stretch beyond stretch,” said Miller. “People like to throw out the Nazi references on both sides of the aisle, and it really muddies the argument of what’s going on.”
He added, “I think her emotions got the best of her, but I think people have real questions about her ability to make sure that justice is blind at this point, and that’s the biggest concern.”
Support for Isham
On Thursday, May 1, there was a large demonstration at the corners of state highways 27 and 63 in the city of Hayward with many people holding signs supporting Isham.
At 2 p.m. approximately 80 demonstrators left the corner by the state highways and walked two blocks by the Sawyer County Courthouse, and they were joined at the courthouse by over 20 students from Lac Courte Oreilles K-12 school who said they came out to support Isham, a fellow tribal member.
 “I’m here to fight for Judge Isham and what we stand for, and I find it inspiring to be here,” said Ashland Demonie, 14.
However, Denomie was also appalled to see some adults driving by swearing at the students and giving the youngsters the middle finger.
“It bothers me because we are just children here fighting for our rights and fighting for who we are, and seeing how harsh some adults respond, who should be more mature, is troubling,” she said.
Ode’iminke Leach, 15, is also a student who came out to support Isham and advocate for Native Americans.
“I’m out here protesting because I support Judges Isham and Dugan,” said Elizabeth Riley of Hayward, a Democrat who has run twice for the 74th Assembly District.

Riley said she feared that under President Donald Trump, the U.S. would not follow the rule of law but become more like a developing nation where authority is in the hands of a powerful individual rather than the written law and guaranteed rights.
Mary Vintcenda of the village of Exeland said she was at the demonstration to support Isham and the rule of law.
“I support Judge Isham because she is standing up for the rule of law,” said Vintcenda, who was joined at the demonstration with her brother, Tom, who was also holding a sign. “She’s standing up for what’s right, and I wish others would join us.”
“So we’re out here supporting Judge Monica Isham,” said Paul DeMain, former editor and owner of News from Indian Country and a Native American active in Democratic politics who has run for state Senate.

DeMain said Isham’s email represents concerns that many judges have across Wisconsin after the arrest of Dugan.
“My understanding is the entire state is engaged in a discussion about how to deal with potential ICE raids in the courtroom,” he said.
DeMain said ICE actively pursuing suspects in a court will discourage witnesses from appearing in court if they fear being arrested by ICE.
“Are they going to show up in the courtroom to testify if they think they’re going to get hauled out and deported to El Salvador and put in a concentration camp?” asked DeMain. “These courts need to be safe. They need to be involved with respecting that due process for all U.S. citizens and all people in this country and let the process work it out.”
He added, “I think what’s going on with this administration, showcasing for publicity reasons the arrest of the Milwaukee judge with massive law enforcement officers, cuffing the judge outside in the parking lot, inviting all the right-wing media to take pictures — these are staged events meant to [cause]  U.S. citizens to be afraid to speak up, to be afraid to have an oppositional view, to stand up for citizens’ rights in this country.”

No injuries were reported in the incident, which took 20K barrels per day out of production. Refinery officials decline to offer details about the cause.
The post Newcastle oil refinery restarts operations after it ‘went boom’ in February appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Refinery in Newcastle has resumed operations months after an apparent explosion in February forced the facility to remain idle for repairs.
The refinery shut down following the Feb. 12 incident, which refinery owner Par Pacific of Houston called an “operational upset.” The company would not provide details of what happened beyond “the main crude heater needed to be replaced” and that there was an “unexpected and unavoidable equipment malfunction,” according to WyoFile interviews and company communications with state officials.
Weston County Emergency Management posted on Facebook the night of the incident that “a heater blew up” at the refinery.
No injuries were reported. 
While some fuel production resumed on April 21, it will be some time before the refinery is back to full capacity of 20,000 barrels a day, Dallas Scholes, Par Pacific’s government and public affairs director, told WyoFile.

“When you bring one of these facilities back online, you’ve got to take it slow,” Scholes said. Because the equipment has been idle for months, making sure everything is running correctly and safely takes time, from bringing the heat up to making sure the oil can move through. “There’s a lot that is involved, and our No. 1 priority in this whole process is to make sure it’s safe, and that’s what we’re focused on.” 
The company is not projecting when the refinery will resume full operational capacity, but it is providing updates on a website dedicated to the incident.
Even with fuel production shut down, the refinery’s workforce has been hard at work, according to Scholes.
“They are some really incredibly hard-working people, and they were doing a lot of extra shifts,” he said. “We used everybody we could on site, and we brought in a lot of really good experts to fill in the gaps and to make things work. They were gainfully employed the whole time. I’m really proud of what they were able to step up and do.” 
The facility produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and propane from Powder River Basin crude, according to the company. The economic impact on the region motivated Par Pacific to get the refinery back in operation as soon as possible, Scholes said.

“We stored a lot [of unrefined crude], but that is one of the reasons why we wanted to work as fast as we could — so that we can make sure that oil is still flowing and still available, and to make sure that our producers are still gainfully employed at the end of the day as well.” 
The ‘explosion’
The company doesn’t use the term “explosion” in public-facing communications, and instead refers to the incident as an “operational upset.” However, in a March 24 letter to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Health, Safety, Security & Environment Manager Michael Baldwin wrote, “During the evening of Feb. 12, [the refinery] experienced an explosion in their crude heater … which resulted in a total shutdown of the refinery.”
The incident did not result in any liquid spills or significant airborne gaseous or powder emissions, according to the company. “There were no emissions that left our fence line,” Scholes said.
Regulatory officials are still in the process of investigating the incident in coordination with Par Pacific.
“Things can go wrong, and we live every day doing everything we can to make sure that they don’t.”Dallas Scholes, Par Pacific
The cause of the incident remains unclear. The company has refused to elaborate. “That [information] has not been passed on to me,” Scholes told WyoFile.
In a written communication to DEQ, the company refers to an “unexpected and unavoidable equipment malfunction” that occurred at about 10:37 p.m. on Feb. 12.
Weston County Emergency Management Coordinator Gilbert Nelson, who has been briefed by the company multiple times since the incident, told WyoFile, “They were just trying to restart the heater and it went boom.”
Par Pacific is studying what happened to cause the heater failure, Scholes said. “Anytime an incident occurs, we’re all hands on deck to come do an investigation to look for lessons learned that we can apply to any of our other facilities.
“Oil and gas refineries can be a dangerous profession,” Scholes added. “Things can go wrong, and we live every day doing everything we can to make sure that they don’t. And we were just incredibly lucky, and we developed new systems. We do new checks. This is not something anybody wants to see repeated, so you can bet that we will do everything we can to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

In the days following, the company’s public updates noted a lingering cold snap and notified locals that they would likely see more steam than usual as crews used boilers to try to keep equipment from freezing. “It was 20 below zero when all this was going on,” Scholes told WyoFile.
The company also notified residents there would be more flaring than usual. Refineries frequently burn residual petrol vapors to reduce their hazardous effects, resulting in a flame at the top of a stack. Later, the refinery asked the state for permission, which was granted, to use a temporary boiler to prevent equipment from freezing, state documents show.
History of incidents
The refinery is situated just south of West Main Street and a half-mile from Newcastle High School. The refinery was established in 1927, and officials are quick to point out that it was the town — at the edge of the Black Hills with a population of about 3,300 — that grew around it.
Par Pacific, which also operates refineries in Hawaii, Billings, Montana and Tacoma, Washington, acquired the facility in 2016.

Under a previous owner in the 2000s, Denver-based Hermes Consolidated, Inc., the refinery was known for a series of mishaps, including a March 2002 spill that rained 20 tons of silica catalyst over a portion of the town, resulting in a 2008 settlement with 47 Newcastle-area residents. Details of the settlement were not disclosed. In the latter part of that decade, the refinery received nine “notices of violation” from Wyoming DEQ, resulting in $427,400 in civil penalties.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also took action against the refinery at the time. 
The company paid a civil penalty of $150,000 in 2009 and agreed to invest $14 million in upgrades to settle several alleged emission violations cited by the EPA. In 2010, Wyoming Refining paid a $157,500 penalty to the EPA for “failure to prepare, submit, and implement an adequate and complete Facility Response Plan.”

Scholes said Par Pacific prioritizes safety and environmental compliance. “We have certain standards at Par that may not have been there before, and we are constantly working to improve operations.”
A 2023 Wyoming DEQ inspection report, the most recent available, determined, “There were no noted concerns during these inspections.” The inspection report also listed the refinery as being in “substantial compliance.”
“The safety of our workers and the community is our No. 1 priority,” Scholes said. “We’re very proud of our employees that live in the Newcastle community, and they stepped up. They did great work in bringing this facility back to where it can eventually get fully online.”From 2017 to 2022, Wyoming’s overall oil refining capacity shrank by 27% — from 177,500 barrels per day to 125,850, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state went from five oil refineries to four in 2021 when HollyFrontier Sinclair converted its Cheyenne oil refinery to produce “renewable diesel,” which uses agricultural products — not oil — to produce the fuel.

Bextel and Miller both align with that block of the party, so the choice between them is not a question of whether the top post will remain a dark shade of red. Both candidates, however, told WyoFile they have different things to offer the party. 
“I’ve got a ton of experience with the [GOP] State Central Committee. I’ve got a ton of experience at the local Sheridan County Central Committee,” Miller said, pointing to over a decade of involvement with the Republican Party. 
“I have established relationships all across the state with a whole lot of people, and that, in itself, is a big deal,” he said.
While newer to the party, Bextel has recently demonstrated impressive fundraising chops and earned the endorsement of Wyoming’s U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman. 
“Brian has been around a long time. But I think that’s the selling point for me,” Bextel said. “If I’m elected, this is about to be taken to a new level.”
A third or more moderate candidate has not publicly announced a bid for chair, but that remains a possibility since nominations can be made during Saturday’s meeting. 
Rebecca Bextel
Bextel moved to Jackson about 20 years ago with her husband, Jonathan, and has made her living in real estate and as a registered agent. In September, she announced she would run for GOP chair, roughly seven months ahead of the election. 
“I decided to run early because it’s a big state, and I wanted to give people plenty of time to look me up or get to know me,” Bextel said, adding that in just the last three weeks she’s driven 9,000 miles and visited almost all 23 counties. 
“I decided to run because I felt like the role of the chairman of the party is to fundraise, grow the party, and direct the party at the will of the body,” she said. “And so this is not going to be the party of Rebecca Bextel. This is going to be the party of the grassroots. It’s going to be a bottom-up approach.”

She’s raised $130,000 for the party since April, she said. 
“I’ve also raised about $300,000 for conservative candidates and PACs. And a lot of those candidates helped push the [Wyoming] House further to the right,” she said. “I’m very proud of that.”
Bextel was herself a fixture of the Wyoming Capitol during the 2025 session, testifying on bills and spending time with lawmakers. That’s something she said she would continue to do as chair. 
“I have a great relationship with a lot of the members of the House. I have a great relationship with some members of the Senate,” Bextel said. 
And while Miller may have experience, Bextel said, he lacks her “energy level” and “enthusiasm.” Plus, Bextel said she has some new ideas, like creating a group within the party to decide the conservative bona fides of Republican candidates. 
“I am actually considering making a new committee that will obviously be an odd number of people from the four corners of the state, across the Republican spectrum, and that committee will figure out who is 80% platform candidates and who is not,” Bextel said. 
The Wyoming Republican Party’s bylaws require officeholders to have “a voting record of at least 80% in support” of the party’s platform and challengers to sign “a pledge to support the Wyoming Republican Party platform-related legislation.” 
The question of who is and isn’t a Republican has long plagued the party, and Bextel is still “marinating” on the idea of the new committee but said she’s been asking for input during her travels.  
Bryan Miller 
Shortly before retiring from military service, Miller opened a consulting firm in Sheridan in 2010. Since then, he’s served as Sheridan County GOP Chair for several terms and ran unsuccessfully for the Wyoming Legislature, U.S. House and U.S. Senate. 
Those campaigns, Miller said, gave him the chance to make connections across Wyoming. 
“I have established relationships with county party after county party over the years,” he said. “They call us up here in Sheridan because they like what we have done,” Miller said, pointing to the party’s growth under his leadership. 
“They like the fact that we took a party that was considered to be iffy in the Republican cause across the state,” Miller said, and turned it “into a party where over 500 people regularly participate in party activities.”

In Sheridan, Miller said, they have a surplus of people willing to volunteer as election judges and poll watchers, and more voters interested in running for precinct committee seats than available spots. 
The party’s communication and visibility in the community, Miller said, is responsible for increased participation, which is something he’d like to work on at the state level. 
“Our messaging here in town has been tremendous. We talk to people. We have a headquarters set up on Main Street every election cycle,” Miller said. “We have a presence in Sheridan like no other county when it comes to the Republican Party.”
Miller said he’s also proud of the fundraising strides his local party has made, but there’s more to being chair of the state party than just filling up the coffers. 
“Yes, money is important. It absolutely is when it comes to campaigns and races and all that. But it’s not the reason that someone should elect a chair,” he said. “I don’t want to see that the dollar signs drive the party toward doing things that will not be helpful to the party’s cause.” 
Miller originally planned to run for vice chair of the party, he said, but a series of events, including a meeting with Bextel, changed his mind. Miller said he also heard from some lawmakers who didn’t take well to Bextel during the session. 
“My ability to work with the leadership in the House and the Senate is tremendously ahead [of Bextel’s],” Miller said. “I’ve actually already been speaking with the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate regarding [Wyoming’s election laws] and this lawsuit that’s been filed in Hot Springs County.” 
Miller is running as a “team” alongside Fremont County Chairwoman Ginger Bennett, who is seeking the position of vice chair of the party. 
“Ginger is who I think should be the vice chair,” Miller said. “Because she’s got that gregarious attitude. And she knows a lot of people. She’s been involved in the Republican women’s groups in the state, and it’s a match that at this point in time is perfect in my opinion.”
What now?
While Saturday’s meeting is open to the public, only county chairs, state committeemen and state committeewomen are allowed to vote in the state party’s officer elections. 
The meeting starts at 9 a.m. at the Cody Auditorium.

Antler hunting in Jackson Hole began Thursday with the “Shed Hunt Motorcade” that saw police escort hundreds of searchers in an orderly fashion through town.
The post Run for the racks appeared first on WyoFile .","“It’s going to be a big old-fashioned horse race,” Hunter Whitney said as he lounged in his makeshift camp Wednesday at the Teton County Fairgrounds, waiting for the opening of shed-antler hunting season.
Camp stoves, backpacks, folding chairs and even a cornhole set surrounded the Star Valley resident as he catnapped among picnic tables at his sidewalk quarters. A long-cold fried egg lay abandoned in a skillet, a pair of sturdy boots aired out on the concrete.
Through a lottery arranged by the Jackson Police Department, Whitney won a coveted spot close to the front of the “Shed Hunt Motorcade.” The hundreds of police-escorted pickups and horse trailers would snake through town to be turned loose on nearby public land at 6 a.m. Thursday. That’s the official Wyoming Game and Fish Department time when antler hunting starts and big game winter range opens in the western and southwestern parts of the state.

Male elk shed hundreds of antlers in the spring, dropping some of them on national forest land beyond the National Elk Refuge — home to some 7,000 elk each winter. The refuge itself is closed to antler gathering except for the local Boy Scout troop, which collects them for an annual auction.
Last year, bidders paid an average of more than $26 a pound. A skull and antlers from a winter-kill elk can bring thousands of dollars, depending on size and condition.
The lottery and motorcade replaced the mayhem of various helter-skelter mass starts that marked iterations of the antler rush in years past.
Mike Jackson, No. 265, drove up from Lyman for his first-ever hunt. He and his family arrived at a prescribed time to park in their place in line.

For a day and a night, the fairgrounds became a community of campers with a common goal. For $20 a head, they could corral their mounts in various nearby rodeo pens.
The Jacksons were going to a restaurant before cozying up in their horse trailer to sleep. 
They planned to get up at 5 a.m., saddle their steeds, load them in the trailer and join the 5:45 a.m. procession to the city limits and open range beyond.
The lottery drew 513 applications, each costing $20, for a designated motorcade spot. By Wednesday afternoon, some 400 vehicles had lined up along Snow King Avenue in a queue that snaked into and around the fairgrounds.
Dubois resident Ty Finley drew No. 2. He was pleased. The No. 1 pickup ahead of him towed a horse trailer that carried only ATVs. Those aren’t allowed off dirt roads, so Finley was pretty sure he would be leading the charge.
After drawing his coveted spot, “I was trying to make sure none of my friends found out about it,” he joked. In fact, he showed up with many friends — Boedeckers, Hankinns, Cragoes, Hadleys and Eastburns — seemingly half the town of Dubois.

Cutting programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion robs Wyoming of win-win opportunities, Rep. Ken Chestek opines. 
The post Attacks on DEI highlight the fallacy of zero-sum thinking appeared first on WyoFile .","In its 2024 budget session, the Wyoming Legislature added a footnote to the budget for the University of Wyoming stating “no funds from this appropriation shall be expended on the office of diversity, equity and inclusion at the University of Wyoming or on any diversity, equity and inclusion program, activity or function.” As a result, the UW closed that office while reassigning some of its functions to other units. Then, UW’s Faculty Senate this spring agreed to terminate the undergraduate academic degrees in gender and women’s studies. Another bill defunding DEI more broadly was adopted by the legislature in 2025, but was vetoed by Gov. Mark Gordon.

Opinion

I am continually baffled at why the Legislature, and others in Wyoming government, are so vehemently opposed to diversity, equity and inclusion. In my world, each one of those things is a value to celebrate, not an evil to eradicate.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder said at the time of the cut to UW’s budget that DEI has become a form of reverse discrimination. She claimed that DEI programs create “preferential treatment of one race, one gender over another, and [that] one race [is] inherently racist over another.” But that is a logical fallacy; specifically, a false dichotomy. It results from zero-sum thinking.
Zero-sum games are situations where for every winner, there is a loser. Think of a typical sale transaction: for every dollar the buyer pays, the seller gains a dollar. The net sum is zero. On the flip side, for every item the seller sells, he loses that item, but the buyer gains the item. Still a net zero.
But human interactions are seldom zero-sum games. They are most often plus-sum games, where both participants gain something from the interaction. Working together, respecting and learning from each other, leaves both participants better off. A plus-sum game. A win-win.
Since DEI practices and attitudes promote respect and learning between different groups, it is a plus-sum game. If a favored, dominant group reaches out to understand and respect a disfavored or oppressed group, that does not weaken the dominant group. The false dichotomy is that social prestige and opportunity are not a win-lose situation. One does not have to choose between which group has opportunities. Sharing opportunities can lift up both groups to heights neither could attain separately.
President Donald Trump has many flaws, but perhaps his biggest flaw is that he seems incapable of anything other than zero-sum thinking. Everything he does is transactional, and he must always “win.” He sees immigrants as taking “our” jobs. Foreign governments are stealing “our” money by having trade surpluses (never mind that private commercial transactions, not foreign governments, create trade imbalances). Law firms that represent his opponents are taking power away from him, so they must be punished. Courts that restrain his illegal actions also deprive him of power, so they must be attacked. All of this he does because of his irrational need to “win” the zero-sum games he perceives.
The Wyoming Freedom Caucus, possibly taking their cue from Trump, is likewise stuck in zero-sum thinking. Its ongoing efforts to defund DEI programs appear to be an attempt to institutionalize the power of favored groups over disfavored groups, apparently in the belief that lifting up the disfavored group somehow diminishes the favored group.
But diversity, equity and inclusion are not zero-sum games. When we all work together — when we respect each other, share our talents with each other, treat each other with the dignity we deserve — we are all better off. Every one of us has a gift to make this world a better place. Let’s share those gifts freely with each other.

March 11, 2025. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Lincoln and Omaha city officials would have the future option to move city elections and line them up with Nebraska statewide elections, under this year’s annual election cleanup bill.
Legislative Bill 521, from State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, advanced 42-0 on Thursday. Sanders, who chairs the Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, said the goal is “modernizing” elections.
“This bill represents a significant investment in the integrity and efficiency of our electoral system,” Sanders said during debate.
Election cleanup package
LB 521 would make a series of changes, including to allow hospice or disability services patient records to count as a photo voter ID, stop petition signature verification of candidates or new political parties at 110% of the goal (similar to ballot measures), notify a voter if their voter registration is canceled, prohibit petition circulation within 200 feet of ballot drop boxes and permit the secretary of state to distribute petition pages to counties “by a secure method,” rather than just mail or by law enforcement.

Four other bills were amended into LB 521, by a 41-0 vote. They would:

Allow Lincoln or Omaha to move odd-year city elections in April and May to instead be in line with statewide primary and general elections (LB 19 from State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha).
Exempt local foster care review boards from the Open Meetings Act (LB 238 from State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha).
Address situations where a public meeting notice has been sent to a newspaper but can’t be published on a proper timeline, and address what happens if a public notice can’t be posted online (LB 243 from Sanders).
Allow political parties to appoint watchers to monitor county election officials’ mandatory three independent tests of vote-counting devices. The results of the tests would later be published online (LB 659 from State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County).

Andersen said his vote-counting reforms “reflect a commitment to election integrity and ensuring Nebraskans have confidence in the accuracy and security of our vote counting.”
LB 521 no longer includes a provision that could have allowed the secretary of state to use software, including artificial intelligence, to assist in processing a filed petition.

Sen. John Cavanaugh’s LB 19 is different from his introduced version, which would have required Omaha to move its off-year elections beginning in 2028. Under his amended bill, Omaha as well as Lincoln officials would have the option of putting a city charter amendment to a vote of residents to change the election timing. 
The bill would not affect 2025 elections.
In odd-numbered years, Omaha primary elections are the first Tuesday of April, while general elections are the first Tuesday after the second Monday in May. For Lincoln, the general election is the first Tuesday in May, and the primary election is four weeks prior.
State law dictates the election timing for cities of the primary class (100,001 to 399,999 residents) and metropolitan size (400,000 or more residents).
This year, Omaha will have its general mayoral election May 13. Lincoln will have its city election May 6, but the mayor is not on the ballot until 2027.
Any city that changes to be in line with statewide election timing could change the point at which terms in office end, according to Cavanaugh. If not, and if, say, one of the cities had an election in November 2028, it could lead to a lame-duck public official for six months. Today, city terms in office start about four weeks after an election.
Cavanaugh said LB 19 would save property tax dollars, such as the $1.5 million Omaha is spending on this off-year election cycle, which he said would probably be a little less for Lincoln. 
He said it also would help with voter fatigue after sometimes “grueling” statewide elections.
LB 521, a Government Committee priority for the year, faces up to two more rounds of debate.



Example timing for Lincoln/Omaha city elections under amended LB 521
City elections in Lincoln and Omaha are in odd-numbered years under existing state law, in contrast to the hundreds of other municipal elections statewide. Under Legislative Bill 521, as amended, officials would have the option to move city elections to even-numbered years.
Terms of office begin in 2025

Current law: Elected May 2025. Term in office June 2025 to June 2029. Next election April/May 2029.
City charter amendment is adopted (before 2028): Elected May 2025. Term in office June 2025 to June 2029, or sooner. Next election May/November 2028.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Education priorities, including funding for K-12 public schools, higher education and early childhood education and child care, proved to be the issues that arose most often in public hearings held by the Wisconsin Legislature’s powerful budget committee in April. 
Wisconsin lawmakers wrapped up their public hearings this week with a hearing Monday in Hayward and one Tuesday in Wausau. Two hearings were held in early April in West Allis and Kaukauna.
With the hearings complete, the Joint Finance Committee will turn its attention to the work of writing the budget with the goal of completing it by the June 30 deadline. If lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers don’t complete the budget by that deadline, Wisconsin continues to operate under the current budget into the next fiscal year. 
Tessa Maglio, digital and communications organizer for the Wisconsin Public Education Network, a nonprofit advocacy organization for public schools, worked with legislative policy Lead Bryn Horton and organizing and engagement coordinator Camden Hargrove to track testimony at each of the public hearings.
“Tracking the testimony is really important because we have seen in budget cycle after budget cycle people ask for the resources Wisconsin kids in their public schools need and then have watched the subsequent budget not meet the requests,” Maglio said. “We wanted to keep it in the forefront of the advocates’ minds as well as the governor’s mind and legislators’ minds.” 
According to the WPEN tracker, more than 900 people spoke across the four hearings, which lasted about 29 total hours. WPEN reported that more than 170 people discussed funding for K-12 schools, more than 50 people spoke about higher education and more than  50  spoke about child care. Maglio said education across the spectrum made up at least a third of the total testimony.
“It is really powerful to hear you know people share their stories and experiences and priorities and so even though some of the topics might not have tallied very high on our tracker, they’re nonetheless still very important,” Maglio said.
On the issue of  K-12 public education, Maglio said, public testimony included calls to raise the special education reimbursement to at least 60%, provide districts with more spendable aid, fix the revenue limit structure, which restricts how much school districts can raise without permission from lawmakers or the public, and help school districts keep their schools operating and serve their students.
There were “many different stories and many different perspectives and people brought their own experiences whether they were coming from large urban districts or small rural districts,” Maglio said. School districts in Wisconsin have not had predictable increases in funding through state aid or property taxes in over 15 years, and an increasing number of school districts have had to rely on getting permission from voters in referendums to meet costs.
Maglio highlighted testimony by Laura McCoy, president of the Green Bay Area Public School District Board of Education, at the Kaukauna hearing. 
McCoy told lawmakers that her community supports their local schools.
“We know this because we just passed yet another referendum: the third referendum in eight years. We’re going to have to pass another one next year,” McCoy said. “Honestly, funding public education by referendum is no way to educate our future generations. Districts around this state are begging for change. Please listen to them.” 
“We are doing our job in Green Bay. We are holding up our piece of the sky. We are preparing our students for the future and we are hitting it out of the ballpark with workforce development,” McCoy added. “But it gets harder every year and we need to feel like the state Legislature is our partner, and not our adversary.” 
JFC Democrats call for education funding
Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee also called on Republican members to fund education in the upcoming state budget during a Wednesday press conference.
“From West Allis to Wausau, the message was consistent and it was clear,” said Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee).  “Wisconsinites want a budget that invests in public education, affordable health care options, workforce development and child care.” 
“It is our job as state legislators,” Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said, “and it is time for my Republican colleagues to join Democrats in actually providing the resources that our kids deserve.” 
Republican leaders have said that the state Supreme Court decision on Evers’ partial veto, which extends the annual $325 revenue limit increase for school districts for 400 years, would affect the state budget. In April, the Court upheld the veto, saying it was within the governor’s  power and suggesting that lawmakers could take different routes, including writing the budget differently or passing a constitutional amendment, if they want to prevent such vetoes in the future. 
Roys said it would be “an excuse” and “pathetic” if Republicans decide not to increase education funding due to the decision. 
“If they want to try to pass a constitutional amendment, we’ve seen them do it again and again. They can certainly give that a try, but I don’t think that’s an acceptable excuse to fail to pass a budget on time, fail to pass a budget that makes the investments that our kids and our constituents — all of our constituents — need and and deserve,” Roys said. 
Johnson added that the state could also cover the cost of the $325 revenue increase Evers’ veto allowed school districts to raise from local taxpayers. 
“I’m hoping that they do the right thing,” Johnson said of her colleagues in the Legislature. “We heard a consensus across the board of taxpayers coming in and testifying, saying that the referendums are not sustainable. It’s not the way for them to fund public education, and let’s be real, it’s not fair, either.” 
Health care concerns
According to the WPEN’s tracking, health care was the second most discussed issue at the hearings. 
“Coming in just behind the focus on public education was Medicaid expansion, Medicaid funding, health care,” said Maglio. “Many, many, many people came out to testify in favor of those things and shared really powerful and sometimes heart-breaking personal stories about the impact that Medicaid funding has on their lives or the lives of their loved ones and what that would mean if that funding were not to be supported in the budget.” 
Evers, as he has done in each of his budget proposals, asked  that Wisconsin take the federal Medicaid expansion that would allow almost all adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level to qualify. Wisconsin is one of only 10 states that has not done so.
This session, though, the request comes at a moment when the Medicaid program is facing the threat of deep cuts from  the Trump administration and Republican members of Congress. Concerns about proposed federal cuts came up at the state budget hearings. 
“Also with farming and food access and previously supported funding for Wisconsin farmers to provide food to schools and to food pantries… Across the board there was kind of an undercurrent [of] people focusing on the needs of Wisconsinites, but urging their lawmakers to think about the budget within the context of decisions being made at the federal level,” Maglio said.
In addition to broader Medicaid expansion, a postpartum Medicaid expansion, which would extend health care coverage for mothers who recently gave birth from 60 days to a year, has been a major point of bipartisan agreement this session. A bill that would make Wisconsin the 49th state to take the extension recently passed the Senate but it faces challenges in the Assembly, where the top Republican has opposed the measure deeming it an expansion of “welfare.” 
Roys called on her Republican colleagues to get it done by placing it in the budget. She noted that the four Democrats and the six Senate Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee, who voted in favor of the bill, could place the proposal in the budget without Assembly Republicans on the committee having to vote in favor. 
“I understand that there are some problems over in the Assembly, and we’ve heard that Vos  is to blame year after year, session after session when this doesn’t get done — despite having overwhelming support for members of his caucus, and, of course, every single Democrat in the Legislature,” Roys said. “The good news is that if Republicans in the Assembly are afraid of political retribution from Speaker Vos or they don’t want to cross him, we can still put postpartum Medicaid expansion in the budget right now.” 
Another major issue that lawmakers will debate this budget is tax cuts, though Roys noted that cuts for “millionaires and billionaires” were not popular topics at the public hearings. 
“That’s one thing that nobody asked for, [but] seems to be the focus of my Republican colleagues,” Roys said. “In fact, they are focused on trying to shove through an irresponsible tax cut before we even engage in meeting the needs of Wisconsinites.”
Republican lawmakers have said they want to pass a tax cut bill prior to the budget. 
“The goal, again, is to try to find something that can actually get across the finish line,” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said in April. During the last legislative session, Evers vetoed several Republican  tax cut proposals, including proposed reductions for the top income tax brackets in the last budget. “I think the governor realizes that we’re not going to spend any more money unless we have the ability to reduce taxes and help folks get by with inflation.”
Evers, meanwhile, has said that he won’t support tax cuts done outside of the budget.
“It has to be part of the budget. We just can’t do things one way, and then, you know, just do taxes and then do spending,” Evers said. “We have to look at it together.”
So far lawmakers have declined to discuss specifics. Committee Co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said at a press conference ahead of the Wausau hearing that details haven’t been negotiated and they aren’t going to “negotiate anything in the media.” 
Democratic legislative leaders have said they haven’t been part of those discussions. 
Roys said that if Democrats were going to support a tax cut, it needs to be part of the budget process and it needs to be “responsible and not create a massive structural deficit that then Republicans will use it as an excuse to undermine the services that we rely on in our public schools.” Any cut, she added, needs to be targeted towards “everyday Wisconsinites.” 
Johnson said that investing in other priorities could also present a better opportunity for savings for taxpayers. 
“Everybody could use a couple of extra dollars in their pocket. Let’s be real, I could use a couple of extra dollars a month, but if those same communities are going to have to go to referendum to support their schools, it’s not a tax break for them,” Johnson said.

Angelito Tenorio, Francesca Hong and Renuka Mayadev in the Wisconsin State Assembly chambers. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)After two sessions as the only Asian American lawmaker in the Wisconsin Legislature, Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), who was first elected in 2020, stood alongside freshmen Reps. Angelito Tenorio (D-West Allis) and Renuka Mayadev (D-Madison) Thursday to announce the formation of the state’s first Legislative Asian Caucus.
The lawmakers announced the creation of the caucus on the first day of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, saying that they have a responsibility to represent Asian American Wisconsinites, who make up 6% of the state, and to work to advance their rights, visibility and improve their daily lives.
“I’m deeply grateful, and I couldn’t think of a better team to be in the Asian caucus with… We have the distinct opportunity to make all of our communities stronger,” said Hong, who is the daughter of Korean immigrants, said. At one point during the press conference, Hong said she felt like she was going to cry.
Tenorio is the first Filipino American to be elected to the state Legislature, and said during the press conference that his parents immigrated to the U.S. “in hopes of finding a better life.” He said that growing up he didn’t see people that looked like him in leadership positions, including in government. 
“That lack of representation stuck with me, and I knew I wanted to change that,” Tenorio said, adding that he was an activist in college, served in the Wisconsin Army National Guard and has become an advocate for addressing climate change and protecting the environment. 
Tenorio said the creation of the caucus is “historic” and a “declaration” that Asian Americans deserve to help shape the future of the state. 
“For too long, our stories, struggles, strengths and victories have been overlooked,” Tenorio said. “As members of the Legislature, we have a seat at the table, and we carry the responsibility to make this table bigger, more inclusive and more representative of our state.” 
Tenorio noted that the lawmakers have introduced a resolution to recognize 2025 as the “Year of the Snake” and a resolution to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the conclusion of the Vietnam War, the Secret War in Laos and of the 50th anniversary of the Fall of Phnom Penh in Cambodia —  conflicts that led to people from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam resettling in the U.S. 
“Such communities largely resettled in Wisconsin, overcoming adversity to establish vibrant communities that have significantly contributed to the social, cultural, and economic fabric of our state” the commemorative resolution states. “Wisconsin is now home to the third-largest Hmong population in the United States, with communities thriving in cities like Appleton, Sheboygan, Green Bay, Wausau and Milwaukee.” 
“These resolutions aren’t just ceremonial. They’re a part of our broader efforts to write our stories into the narrative of our states, to affirm that we are not outsiders,” Tenorio said. “We are part of the fabric of Wisconsin.”
The caucus members said they will host events throughout the month to highlight the contributions of Asian Americans, including one focused on Japanese internment, another on celebrating the Hmong community and one to uplift Filipino stories.
“There is so much to celebrate, so much to be proud of and so much to feel honored by being an Asian American,” Hong said. 
Maydev is the first South Asian elected to the Assembly and represents the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus and other parts of the state’s capital city. She noted that her district is about 17% Asian American and she represents the highest concentration of Asian Americans in the state. 
Mayadev said that her journey to hold public office didn’t start when she submitted her nomination papers. 
“It started when my parents decided to leave everything they knew in their homes more than 50 years ago, and traveled from India as immigrants to the United States,” Mayadev said. “Like the representatives beside me, we are all first-generation Americans — proud children of immigrants.”
Mayadev also emphasized that the lawmakers will bring in the voices of others in the community. She said people have reached out to her for that reason already. 
“They said they’ve never reached out to an Assembly person before, but they reached out to me because they felt that they would have an empathetic ear and an understanding that goes deeper that maybe they felt that somebody else wouldn’t be able to be,” Mayadev said. 
Hong said caucus members will also make sure to go to different communities in the state and work to identify leaders who want to build relationships. 
The formation of the caucus comes as Republicans at a federal and state level have targeted immigrants as well as diversity and inclusion efforts. 
“We must do more. We know the reality on the ground. AAPI folks, like so many immigrants, workers and people of color, continue to face threats and challenges — from the underrepresentation and political exclusion of Asian Americans to the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes to growing economic inequality,” Tenorio said. “We are navigating a landscape that too often undermines our dignity and our safety.” 
Mayadev acknowledged the caucus is being established during a time of upheaval for immigrants as the Trump administration has proclaimed its aim of carrying out mass deportations and has detained even immigrants who are in the country legally. Wisconsin Republicans have supported those efforts, seeking legislation that requires local law enforcement to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to discussing removing a Milwaukee County judge who was arrested by the FBI and is accused of impeding the arrest of a man that ICE followed to her courtroom.
“There’s much uncertainty and fear,” Mayadev said, adding that caucus members are committed to providing “guidance and leadership during this time, so that all feel welcome in Wisconsin.”
Asked about the targeting of inclusion efforts by Republicans in the state Legislature, Hong mentioned a recent hearing in the Joint Audit Committee, where Republican lawmakers grilled state agency leaders on their inclusion efforts. 
“I plan to speak with the chairs of that committee about my experiences when I first got here of deep xenophobia and racism,” she said, adding that she hoped by being “very truthful, honest and vulnerable” she and other members of color could “dispel some of the preconceived notions that racism and discrimination isn’t happening right here in the halls of power amongst colleagues.”

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)Abortion advocates and providers in Colorado feel increased pressure under the Trump administration to support people seeking abortions from Colorado and surrounding states with restrictions. 
Melisa Hidalgo-Cuellar, abortion fund director for Cobalt, said the organization has been “constantly adapting” to meet the demand for support. The abortion fund has increased its staffing capacity over the last couple of years and ramped up its digital security to ensure client information is protected. 
Cobalt, one of two Colorado-based abortion funds that offers financial support to patients seeking abortion care, is also helping clients navigate mis- and disinformation related to abortion care. Hidalgo-Cuellar said many patients in restrictive states don’t know there are financial assistance resources available because their states and communities intentionally try “to keep that information out of their hands.”
“We really see that play a role in the abortion funding world when we are working directly with abortion seekers who are fearful of leaving their state to access care and having to walk them through the resources available to them,” Hidalgo-Cuellar said.

While there’s been an increase of people seeking abortion care in Colorado since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion in the Dobbs v. Jackson decision and Texas’ abortion ban, providers are looking for different ways they can help meet the demand, relying particularly on telehealth, Hidalgo-Cuellar said. She’s also seen increased coordination between abortion funds and clinics to help make sure each patient gets care in a way accessible to them. 
About 62% of Colorado voters supported Amendment 79 in November, which made abortion access a constitutional right in Colorado. The Colorado Legislature approved a measure implementing the amendment and also passed several shield laws to protect providers as well as out-of-state patients. Every state except New Mexico that borders Colorado, as well as Texas, has abortion restrictions.
A new report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health, found that abortions actually decreased by about 2,400 in both Colorado and New Mexico from 2023 to 2024. The total still remains higher than before the Dobbs decision in both states, though. It stood at 24,490 in Colorado last year. Increased capacity from clinics in Kansas likely contributed to the reduction for Colorado and New Mexico, as well as broader access to telehealth medication abortion under protection of shield laws, according to the report.  
While Cobalt is still waiting to hear back from a few clinics before it has final spending data from the first quarter of 2025, Hidalgo-Cuellar said Cobalt has already seen an increase in patients served as well as cost per patient, meaning there’s higher demand for financial support. 
For funding directly supporting a patient’s ability to pay for a procedure, preliminary numbers show Cobalt has spent about $306,000 in the first quarter of 2025, compared to $218,000 in the first quarter of 2024, Hidalgo-Cuellar said. The fund also helped 883 clients between January and March 2025 compared to 717 in those months in 2024. 
Over 50% of Cobalt’s procedural funding in 2024 went to patients in Colorado. But just under 90% of Cobalt’s practical support funds — which help people pay for travel, lodging and child care expenses needed to access abortion care — went to patients from Texas. 
“That tells you that we have that enormous need coming out of Texas as people are forced to travel for abortion care. They’re having to put their lives on pause to be able to access this care,” Hidalgo-Cuellar said. “These are just the numbers from the people who found out about Cobalt, who knew that money was available. There are so many people who are navigating this process on their own without understanding that financial support is available.”
Abortion deserts still a problem
Vanessa Martinez, vice president of policy at the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights, said Colorado’s willingness to support out-of-state patients in need is not a threat to Coloradans’ ability to access reproductive health care. She said the biggest threat to care would be if anti-abortion states start to bring lawsuits against Colorado providers, though the state’s shield provisions exist to protect those providers.
“Colorado has been a leader in reproductive care at the national level, and when we consider the national ecosystem of care, Colorado is so, so important both for abortion care and for gender-affirming care,” Martinez said. “There are people who drive hours and hours to be able to get the care that they need here in Colorado.”
The Guttmacher report said 26% of abortions provided in Colorado in 2024 went to out-of-state patients.

There are people who drive hours and hours to be able to get the care that they need here in Colorado.


– Vanessa Martinez, vice president of policy at the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights


Hidalgo-Cuellar said the abortion clinics Cobalt works with overall have seen shorter wait times for an appointment as they have increased their capacity. Many have been able to accommodate urgent cases, when a patient needs to be seen in a day or two. 
The need for practical support still exists in Colorado, particularly in abortion deserts, Hidalgo-Cuellar said. Patients in rural parts of the state might have to travel up to six hours to access care. 
“Abortion deserts have always been and still are problems even in access states, in protected states such as Colorado,” Hidalgo-Cuellar said. 
Telehealth has been crucial for abortion deserts, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains spokesperson Fawn Bolak said. Since the Durango Planned Parenthood temporarily closed due to provider shortages, Bolak said Planned Parenthood has connected patients to its virtual clinic so they can continue to access care. She said the only service patients in Durango cannot access as a result of the closure is a procedural abortion. 
“We are actively recruiting for an advanced practice clinician so that we can reopen that health center,” Bolak said. “The reason why we had to temporarily close that location is because we are navigating a national provider shortage. Health care institutions, not just in reproductive and sexual health care, but across the board are really feeling a significant burden from this provider shortage and we’re definitely not immune to that.” 
Some providers have looked specifically to abortion deserts for sites of future clinics. Hidalgo-Cuellar said that’s what Care Colorado did when it opened a clinic in Pueblo.
Goal is to instill fear
Bolak said she’s seen how “frustrated” and “scared” patients are under the Trump administration, particularly immigrants who lack permanent legal status. Reproductive and sexual health advocates have known the Trump administration would target access to care, but the “swiftness with which they have begun” attacking health care, particularly gender-affirming care, has been “pretty devastating,” she said. 
“Since Trump announced that he would be seeking reelection, we began preparing for things like additional attacks on access to mifepristone, additional abortion bans, attacks on contraception, attacks on health insurance and different things like that,” Bolak said. 
Trump has said he will leave abortion policy to the states, but he pardoned anti-abortion protesters who were prosecuted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, and his administration has withheld funding from Planned Parenthood clinics. Advocates also fear the administration will target mifepristone and misoprostol, two medications used to perform abortions and manage miscarriages. 
Hidalgo-Cuellar said attempts to criminalize seeking and providing abortion care have increased across the board under the Trump administration. She said part of the goal is to instill fear in anyone seeking abortion care and anyone helping those seeking care. 
Martinez said her organization has had concerns since last summer about attacks from anti-abortion states, especially now that the federal government “not only doesn’t protect the rights of everyone in our communities, but often targets a lot of the community members that COLOR advocates for: community members of color, LGBTQ+ community members, immigrant Coloradans.” 
Many Latino and Latina people COLOR works with have felt a sense of instability since Trump took office, Martinez said. Those with immigrant family members who lack permanent legal status have been particularly on edge and consider whether accessing any kind of health care could put their loved ones at risk. Martinez said many people need help understanding what insurance coverage options are available for them, and hesitate to enroll in public programs out of fear it will put them “on a list that the federal government will later use” to target their families. 
“We’re seeing uncertainty from community members just in navigating their health needs, and this isn’t coming up just in emergency situations,” Martinez said. “It’s coming up too in child visits — Do I take my child to get their vaccines, to their checkups? — which is really scary for entire communities.”
Martinez said Colorado Senate Bill 25-130, which would ensure that anyone who goes to an emergency room cannot be denied care, is especially important after instances in other states when pregnant people have gone to an emergency room needing “miscarriage management” or abortion care only for that care to be delayed or denied “at the expense of their lives.”
She said the bill will also help people in rural communities who might not have direct access to specialty providers.
“We know that already has happened in Colorado where folks have seen delays in care at the emergency room or not been transferred to the emergency room soon enough,” Martinez said. 
The bill passed the Senate and its House committee hearing Monday, and is scheduled for debate in the House Friday.

(Getty Images)Contraception can be one of the greatest tools for safely, affordably and effectively growing a family. 
When we collectively talk about birth control, the conversation is often about pregnancy prevention, but what is missed is the nuance that contraception improves health and economic outcomes for families and even supports their growth. Access to birth control gives individuals and couples the power to choose when and how to have children leading to better outcomes in their health, economic stability, and ultimately leads to a more prosperous Idaho.
Idahoans can now get six months of birth control under new law

And when people feel more confident and in control, they’re often more willing to build their families to the size they want and work toward the necessary means to support them.
We have been, and will always be, advocates for Idaho families. As board members of the Idaho Contraceptive Education Network, we are committed to facilitating healthy, respectful dialogue about the many ways birth control can support families at every stage. 
Our network and membership, comprised of hundreds of Idahoans across the state, have raised their own families or varying sizes, utilizing tools like contraception to do so on their terms. As a statewide network, we advocate in order to dispel myths and sharing real information about contraception, which can and does support healthy, growing families in numerous ways. 
Imagine a future where every Idahoan has the ability to grow their family with intention. 
One big factor in whether families feel able to keep growing is their ability to space pregnancies. Health experts, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, recommend waiting at least 18 months between births to lower health risks for both mother and baby. 
As couples build families, planning for the desired spacing of their children is important. Couples who can space pregnancies may be more likely to grow their family to the desired size when the risk of complications is reduced. 
Access to contraception allows Idahoans to pursue education, careers, and financial stability — all important factors for building healthy families. The freedom to pursue financial security doesn’t diminish the desire to become parents — it often makes couples more prepared and excited to do so when the time is right.
Available and affordable contraception truly allows couples to think clearly about what they want their family to look like and to pursue those goals intentionally. Studies show that people are more likely to reach their desired number of children when they have access to effective contraception. 
Couples should be allowed to determine what they want their family to look like and have the freedom and tools to make choices reflective of their goals, values, and readiness. This kind of intentionality is important — it allows people to consider not just how many children they want, but also when they want them, what kind of life they hope to provide, and how parenthood fits into other aspects of their lives. 
Being intentional doesn’t mean having everything figured out perfectly, but it does mean making informed, thoughtful decisions rather than being caught off guard by circumstances.
Contraception has also been proven to help to-be parents stay in the workforce, complete school or training, and build financial security before becoming parents. That’s not a detour — it’s a foundation. 
Delaying childbearing for the right reasons often leads to being in a better position to raise multiple children, and if those options do not exist it is possible families may opt out of growing their families.
Access to effective contraception plays a crucial role in supporting this intentional approach. Without that access, they may be more vulnerable to unplanned pregnancies, which can make it harder to reach the family structure and size envisioned. 
Contraception isn’t just about prevention — it’s about empowerment. It gives couples the ability to align their reproductive lives with their long-term hopes and plans, rather than leaving something so significant up to chance.
If we’re serious about supporting families in Idaho, we need to start by empowering people to build the families they envision. Birth control plays an important role in that — it allows couples to plan for children when they’re ready, creating the stability and intention that strong families are built on. Ensuring Idahoans have the ability to prepare for parenthood better equips them to raise children in healthy, secure, and thriving homes.

A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the […]","Apartments and stores under construction in Rapid City, S.D., in 2023. New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.


Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.
Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

“Remember you have zero connection to (Phoenix Solutions) and don’t know much except they’ve done work for you and they are good,” read one message from Cothren to Casada in November 2019.
Smith resigned her legislative seat in 2022 and pleaded guilty to honest services fraud in connection with a scheme in which she and Casada directed lawmakers to use Phoenix Solutions for their taxpayer-funded printing and postage program for constituent mailers. Casada and Cothren are charged with 20 counts of fraud, theft and money laundering.
In a December 2019 message read by Worcester, Cothren texted, “We just have to make sure no one knows it’s me involved.”
“That’s short term,” Casada responded. “In 12 months, no one will remember.”
Amid text discussions of how to gain additional campaign business from the House Republican Caucus, Cothren suggested disguising his voice on phone calls with caucus members. 
Flow of money from state to defendants outlined
Prosecutors outlined the money laundering method defendants allegedly used to cover up payments to a vendor that tapped into lawmakers’ constituents mailers in 2020.
Testimony from an FBI forensic accountant detailed how the money flowed to companies run by Smith, Casada and Cothren. 
Thursday’s testimony showed how the money allegedly flowed from the state to Phoenix Solutions or Cothren, whose identity was “masked” because of his 2019 resignation in connection with a racist and sexist texting scandal.
The FBI’s forensic accountant prepared several charts to show the trio allegedly laundered nearly $52,000 over the first half of 2020.
In one instance, Rivers Edge Alliance, a company run by Smith, sent invoices to the state for a total of $10,969 for producing mailers for Republican Reps. Esther Helton-Haynes of East Ridge, Dan Howell of Cleveland and Casada. House members receive $3,000 annually for postage and printing of constituent mailers.
The state paid Rivers Edge Alliance, which then sent a check to Phoenix Solutions for $10,100, which was transferred to Cothren, even though he wasn’t part of Smith’s company.
Almost all of the money wound up with Cothren, the accountant testified. Another chart showed Casada, who ran Rightway Consulting, and Smith received 25% each of the proceeds and Cothren 30% while the rest went back into Phoenix Solutions.

It’s not exactly the trial of the century (or the crime of the century, for that matter). But it’s good enough for folks around here.
They tell me that more corruption takes place at the Cordell Hull Building on a daily basis than in the entire Phoenix Solutions “scam” to tap into lawmakers’ constituent mailer business in early 2020.
In fact, Thursday’s federal courtroom crowd thinned out noticeably. But earlier in the week, when people still had feeling in their butt bones, a handful of interested lawmakers showed up, such as Republican Rep. Todd Warner and Democratic Reps. Gloria Johnson, Shaundelle Brooks, Gabby Salinas and Justin Jones. (The reference to rear end pain stems from sitting for hours on the wooden courtroom pews.)
Other Republicans such as Rep. Jay Reedy and Patsy Hazlewood were compelled — by subpoena — to testify about how they let the secretive company do their constituent mailers, not knowing that the ex-chief of staff for former House Speaker Glen Casada was running the company. Hazlewood and Reedy both said they wouldn’t have let Phoenix Solutions get their business if they’d known Cade Cothren was behind the set-up. He left the post following a racist and sexist texting scandal just four months before Casada vacated the leadership job in 2019 following a no-confidence vote by the House Republican Caucus.










Cade Cothren’s always been straight up to me. He’s done fantastic work. I’d put him up against the best in the state.


– Rep. Todd Warner, R-Chapel Hill 


Warner, a Chapel Hill Republican, was the only lawmaker to show up in support of Cothren. His home was raided the same day feds visited Cothren, Casada and Smith in 2021, but he hasn’t been indicted and said this week he hasn’t used his printing and postage account for constituent mailers, instead tapping into the $3,000 yearly allowance only to buy items such as flags for schools.  
Warner acknowledged Cothren has done consulting work for him, added. “He does very good work,” something the defense is trying to push.
Asked if he has any reservations about continuing to use Cothren, who is believed to be connected to Dixieland Strategies, as well as Phoenix Solutions, Warner said, “We’ll see how it plays out. He hasn’t been found guilty yet. Cade Cothren’s always been straight up to me. He’s done fantastic work. I’d put him up against the best in the state.”
Warner defeated incumbent Rep. Rick Tillis in 2020 while using Dixieland Strategies. Tillis, whose brother is U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis from North Carolina, was an online critic of Casada during his short tenure as House speaker. Someone urinated on Tillis’ office chair in 2019 just to add a little spice to the situation.
In contrast, Johnson wasn’t nearly as kind to the defendants when she spoke with the Lookout during a break in the trial.
  “I’m sitting there working on legislation. They’re working on how they can make money off the state, and that’s disgusting to me,” said Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Knoxville Democrat, outside Nashville’s federal courthouse. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“What we’re talking about is what folks are doing up in Cordell Hull and up in the Capitol, and the corruption that we see,” Johnson said. 
Smith testified Monday that almost as soon as she arrived in Nashville after winning election and replacing former House Majority Leader Gerald McCormick she met with Casada and Cothren about finding a way to make money, Johnson pointed out.
“And then she starts talking about … we went for the state mail accounts because it was low-hanging fruit,” Johnson said. “So she said her colleagues were low-hanging fruit and those state taxpayer dollars were low-hanging fruit for them.”
“I’m sitting there working on legislation. They’re working on how they can make money off the state, and that’s disgusting to me,” Johnson said.
Questions are being raised by the defense and on-lookers about the minuscule amount of money involved in the case, about $52,000. But while lawyers argued this week over whether evidence could be admitted dealing with efforts to win Republican Caucus and campaign business – which they did – it was likely only the beginning, that is until they got caught.
“Just another brick in the wall”
Defense attorneys for Cothren subpoenaed just about everyone but the late pope to testify. 
They also served a subpoena on Smith’s Chattanooga attorney, Ben Rose, on Wednesday (not for his flashy suits) for allegedly trying to communicate with Smith while she was on the stand.
It happened when defense attorney Cynthia Sherwood asked Smith to tell her about discussions she had with Rose this week after trial was recessed. Everyone in the court burst out laughing, knowing talk between attorneys and clients is privileged information. 
During a back-and-forth between Sherwood and Smith that got a little tense, the defense attorney asked her if she was communicating with her attorney from the stand. Smith responded by saying she couldn’t see his head in the back of the courtroom.
Still, Sherwood — after co-counsel Joy Longnecker whispered in her ear — said she might try to have that attorney-client privilege waived.  
Sources tell the Lookout that they tried to serve a subpoena Wednesday on Rose in the courtroom but then asked him to return it because they needed to make a copy. This hasn’t been confirmed.
  No laughing matter? Courtroom observers burst out laughing when an attorney for the defense asked former Rep. Robin Smith, center, to disclose conversations she had with her attorney, Ben Rose, left, when court wasn’t in session. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Rose tried to have the subpoena quashed Thursday, and his co-counsel, David Bridgers, told Judge Eli Richardson they felt the defense was making a “deliberate attempt” to confuse Smith on the stand.
“We wish the government had objected sooner,” Bridgers said, adding they felt “defenseless.” “All we were doing was saying ‘object’ and to no one in particular other than ourselves.”
Richardson deferred the matter. But the Lookout believes everyone can agree it’s little wonder the trio in question couldn’t keep Phoenix Solutions a secret because Smith can’t stop talking, even when the judge says answer only “yes or no.”
How long can we take it?
First, people wanted to know if this trial would start as rescheduled on April 22 after a multitude of delays. Indictments were made in August 2022.
Now, everyone wants to know when it will end. One of the jurors asked to be excused because she couldn’t afford to miss four weeks of pay. That sent shock waves through the courtroom.
After the first couple of days, it seemed that four weeks was a major underestimation, especially since Judge Richardson had to keep calling the attorneys to the bench for a sidebar every 15 minutes, once because the defense objected to the prosecution asking a witness to describe House “leadership,” not whether they’re good or bad, which we already know, but who they are.
Another major delay broke out in an argument over whether the prosecution could admit evidence dealing with Republican Caucus and campaign work done by Phoenix. Richardson said he hadn’t seen such a ruckus in his 27 years in federal court. Clearly, he’s never covered the Tennessee House chamber where fights, riots and name-calling are as common as sarcasm in the press box.
Anyway, we’re predicting this ain’t over by a long shot.
“It’s been such a long time / I think I should be going / And time doesn’t wait for me / It keeps on rollin’.” *

May 1, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz VelizAfter a rainy Thursday afternoon, hundreds of people, including workers, students, and retired community members, marched through the streets of downtown Detroit, rejecting and criticizing the Trump administration’s actions during its first 100 days in office, which has featured an assault on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and a rollback of federal agencies and departments.
The march took place as part of a demonstration organized by May Day Detroit, 50501 Michigan, and other local social movements. It began with a rally that brought together hundreds of people outside Michigan Central Station at Roosevelt Park in the Corktown neighborhood, commemorating International Workers’ Day.
This demonstration took place alongside others organized simultaneously in various cities across the country and throughout the state of Michigan. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
International Workers’ Day, also known as May Day, commemorates the historic fight for an eight-hour workday and the broader pursuit of fair labor conditions, stemming from events like the Haymarket affair in Chicago in 1886.
As the sky began to clear and the rain subsided, dozens of people approached Roosevelt Park carrying signs and banners criticizing Elon Musk, Trump, and the current administration.
Various groups gathered on the sidewalk along Michigan Avenue holding their signs to begin their demonstration, receiving both support and, in some cases, rejection from passing drivers. At the same time, other groups were gathering in the park as the speakers were about to begin
“Long live international workers’ solidarity,” said Frank Hammer, 82, labor activist and former president of the United Auto Workers Local 909.
“We are embracing May Day and putting the ruling class on notice that we are here to fight as one united working class,” Hammer added.
Several speakers addressed the crowd during the rally, touching on topics such as the deportation of immigrant workers, police violence, worker layoffs, funding cuts, and the rising death toll of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
“While our essential services are being cut, law enforcement remains well-funded and well-protected.” said Victoria Camille, a member of the Coalition for Police Transparency and Accountability. “Instead, our basic needs are being stripped, while law enforcement stands by to uphold so-called ‘law and order.’ What’s happening in our country is neither lawful nor orderly in any way.”
Amid federal funding cuts that have affected Michigan communities in food, education, health, and research, a bipartisan plan supported by Michigan House Republicans proposes creating a $115 million annual Public Safety and Violence Prevention Trust Fund to support local law enforcement.
Although there was a great sense of optimism regarding the social actions against the Trump administration during the demonstration, some community members expressed concern about the effectiveness of these actions since the beginning of the current government.
“We (workers) are gonna get hit hard, we’re gonna have tariffs by the middle of the summer, and when that happens, there will be a lot of layoffs. We’re gonna have people very desperate,” said George Lutz, 29, a Detroit resident.
“People are happy to go and make funny signs about Elon Musk and Trump, but when the police start shutting down factories, or when people really have to face the authorities of this country, when they are desperate, they will be forced to take it more seriously than now,” Lutz highlighted.
A few minutes past 5 p.m., the protesters began to march along Michigan Avenue toward downtown Detroit, carrying their signs and chanting slogans in support of workers, such as “May Day every day across the USA” and “Sí se puede,” which means “Yes, we can” in Spanish.
The protesters made a stop at the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building, where more speakers took the microphone to express their concerns to the audience.
“Our postal office is under attack; they (the government) want to privatize it, just turn it into a profit-making corporation, and we don’t work for profit. Sending letters will become more expensive,” said Gina Favors, 75, a retired member of the postal workers’ union. “Help us keep the postal office public; it was made for the people, let’s keep it that way.”
Trump, who referred to the constitutionally-mandated institution as a money-losing entity, has floated the idea of transferring the postal service to the Department of Commerce.
The protesters marched through some streets in downtown Detroit, escorted by police cars at the front and rear of the march, until they returned to Michigan Avenue, where more protesters joined them while others observed from their windows. They arrived back at Roosevelt Park, where the protest ended around 7:30 p.m. without any incidents.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/164A0474-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 06:03:36.549319

Experiments using organoids, tissue chips, computational models, and real-world data analyses produce results that more directly translate to humans.
“For decades, our biomedical research system has relied heavily on animal models. With this initiative, NIH is ushering in a new era of innovation,” NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in the announcement. “By integrating advances in data science and technology with our growing understanding of human biology, we can fundamentally reimagine the way research is conducted — from clinical development to real-world application. This human-based approach will accelerate innovation, improve healthcare outcomes, and deliver life-changing treatments. It marks a critical leap forward for science, public trust, and patient care.”
This positive news comes just days after the Food and Drug Administration announced it would begin to phase out animal use in favor of human-relevant research methods.

This shift away from animal experiments will allow new, more effective pharmaceuticals to be delivered to the market sooner for patients who need them. 
It will save money. A 2022 economic analysis estimated that the use of non-animal technologies for new drug toxicity testing instead of animal tests could generate over $24 billion in increased research productivity. This would mean streamlined drug development and translate to cost savings for patients.
And, it will reduce the number — estimated at more than 100 million — of dogs, cats, monkeys, mice, rats and other animals being used in painful and deadly experiments each year. 
In a recent poll, 86% of Americans said “animal experimentation should be phased out in favor of more modern research methods.”
I wholeheartedly agree. And now, the NIH and FDA do too.

In fact, I’ve never written a commentary before. But after spending the last month deployed to western North Carolina as part of the Hurricane Helene recovery mission, I realized that sometimes the most honest way to tell the story is to share the view from the ground, through my own experience and perspective. 
My goal is to help the public understand the scale, complexity and humanity behind this mission. With my deployment soon coming to an end, and another public affairs professional rotating in to continue telling this story, it felt like the right time to reflect on what I’ve experienced and why this work matters.

First impressions on the ground 
When I arrived here, it had already been more than six months since Hurricane Helene carved its way through the region. As a 20-year Air Force veteran, I’m no stranger to deployments or disaster zones, but I was still taken aback by the scale of devastation that remained. Piles of storm debris filled riverbanks and blocked access to homes and businesses, but just as striking as the damage was the recovery already underway. There were visible signs that, with the help of FEMA, USACE, and our contractors and partners, communities were finding their footing again. 
One of my first stops upon arriving was a temporary debris management site. The sheer volume of material was staggering, with massive mounds of both vegetative and manmade debris. Trucks came and went in a constant flow, unloading raw debris and hauling away mulch by the ton. I had seen news footage before I arrived but seeing it in person gave me a new respect for what it takes to move a community toward recovery. Not just the scale of the effort, but the coordination, the endurance and the heart behind it. 
Understanding the complexity of disaster response 
Each day since then has deepened that understanding. In my role, I have the privilege of traveling to different sites throughout the region, such as waterway debris removal operations, water treatment facilities, meetings with local leaders, and everywhere in between. I get to see the full picture, both figuratively and literally, as I document the mission through photos and stories for the public and our stakeholders. And from that vantage point, I’ve learned something that I believe more people need to hear.
From the outside, disaster response may seem simple: see a problem, send help. But the reality is far more complex. There’s a structure, a chain of requests and assignments, and a deliberate process in place to ensure resources are used efficiently, fairly and in accordance with the law. 
In the aftermath of a disaster like Hurricane Helene, federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are ready and willing to help, but we are limited in what we can do initially. The process starts with a presidential disaster declaration, followed by state and local governments identifying specific needs. FEMA then assigns missions to various federal agencies, including USACE, based on those needs. That’s how we end up where we are, doing what we’re doing. It’s not about picking and choosing; it’s about fulfilling a very specific role within a much larger response framework. 
Stewardship, accountability and urgency 
I’ve also come to see the importance of something that often gets overlooked, which is stewardship. The funding that supports these recovery efforts comes from taxpayers across the country. That means someone in Kansas, Delaware or even Alaska, is contributing to the cleanup here in North Carolina. And with that comes a responsibility to be accountable. That’s why eligibility rules exist for what can be removed and how contractors are paid. It’s also why we have safeguards in place to help prevent fraud, waste and abuse. 
That same sense of responsibility applies to the environment. Many of the areas we’re working in are ecologically sensitive: waterways with nesting birds, vegetation that supports wildlife, and communities that rely on natural beauty to fuel their tourism economies. And while we’re mindful of those concerns, we also have to balance them with urgency. Every day that work is delayed, livelihoods hang in the balance. The contractors working here are operating under agreements that require steady progress.  The funding that supports these recovery efforts is tied directly to performance milestones. If work stalls, it doesn’t just affect a schedule, it can jeopardize the resources available to continue the mission, slow down the recovery for entire communities, and prolong the hardship for families and businesses that are depending on us. 
The clock is always ticking; not just for us, but for the people whose lives and futures  are still shaped by what Hurricane Helene left behind. 
Unique circumstances 
This mission has also presented challenges that most hurricane responses don’t. Coastal regions often have disaster plans in place. They’ve seen these storms before and are equipped to act quickly. But the mountains of western North Carolina aren’t where you would expect to experience a hurricane. This storm hit, leaving state and local officials, residents, and even federal partners navigating unfamiliar territory. The learning curve was steep, and decisions had to be made in real time. That led to frustration, misinformation and, at times, assumptions that didn’t reflect the full picture. But through it all, one thing has been clear. Every person here, from government employees to contractors to local leaders, is here to help. That’s the common theme in every conversation, every challenge, and every cubic yard of debris cleared. 
The people behind the mission 
One of the greatest privileges of this deployment has been meeting the people behind the mission. I get to talk to contractors, Corps employees and local officials every day. Not just about what they do, but why they do it. Through a series we call Responder Spotlight, I’ve had the chance to interview individuals who volunteered to deploy here from across the country, many leaving behind families, home districts and daily routines to support a community they had never visited before. Their reasons vary. Some are drawn by duty, others by curiosity, and many by a deep desire to serve. But whatever the reason, their impact is unmistakable. 
Each person has a story worth telling. And while I can’t highlight them all here, one interaction during a site visit reminded me of just how connected this mission is to the people we’re here to help. 
During a visit to the region by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Mr. Lee Forsgren, we stopped at one of our private property debris removal sites where the owners had requested and been approved for assistance in removing debris left by Hurricane Helene. In addition to scattered vegetative debris, a historic structure on their land had been severely damaged — a tobacco barn that had stood on the family property for more than 100 years. 
As we stood there, we watched an excavator operator carefully begin the demolition. He removed wooden planks from one corner of the building, then moved to the opposite side and, with a final push, brought the structure down. The barn crumbled in a cloud of dust and splintered wood, collapsing onto itself.

The structure was damaged in Hurricane Helene and presented a safety concern requiring it to be torn down and removed. (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis)
What made the moment so impactful was seeing the property owners look on as it happened. This wasn’t just an old shed or garage that could easily be replaced. It was a piece of their family’s history. A place filled with memories, tied to generations of work, pride and tradition. It needed to come down for safety reasons, but its loss left a void both physically on the property and emotionally in their lives. 
Being able to share in that moment, and to capture it through my camera lens, will stay with me long after this deployment ends. And for Mr. Forsgren, witnessing that scene firsthand, I’m sure offered a powerful, undeniable reminder of what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is doing here, and why this mission matters so deeply. 
Mr. Forsgren was accompanied on his visit by Maj. Gen. Jason Kelly, the USACE deputy commanding general for Civil and Emergency Operations. While speaking to some local media, Kelly explained that when you wear the military uniform, you’re often playing the “away game,” deploying overseas to protect our country and interests. But here, in North Carolina, we’re playing the “home game.” We’re helping Americans, in America. For me, there’s something special and deeply fulfilling about that.  
Why we keep showing up 
There are frustrating days, of course. Particularly when managing social media. Most of the feedback is positive, but occasionally someone will misunderstand what we’re doing, or use the comments to spread misinformation. We try not to let it get to us. Sometimes it’s an opportunity to clarify and educate. Other times, our followers jump in and offer support themselves. But in those moments, I’m reminded why it’s so important to keep telling the story. Because even while other parts of the country face new emergencies — wildfires in the West, floods in the South, hurricane season on the horizon — the work here isn’t finished. There are still people hurting, still communities trying to recover, and still lives waiting to be put back together.  
At the heart of it all, I guess what I would want people to know is that we’re still here. USACE and our partners are still on the ground, still clearing debris, and still helping communities in western North Carolina recover from a storm that changed everything. This isn’t just about logistics, equipment or contracts; it’s about people. 
Disaster response doesn’t end when the cameras leave or the headlines change. It continues quietly, behind the scenes, carried out by individuals who care deeply about doing the right thing whether anyone notices or not. 
If I could bring the public out here for just one day, I’d want them to see what I see. Not just the debris or the cleanup, but the resilience and the commitment. The business owner getting ready for the summer season. The kayaker asking when the river will be safe again. The contractor working weekends and holidays to finish a job because he knows it matters. This region is filled with beauty, both natural and human, and the urgency to restore it is real.

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. 

The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.

 Former Richmond FOIA officer’s case against city moves forward

A trial date has been scheduled for Sept. 23 in a transparency case involving the city of Richmond’s former Freedom of Information Act officer, who said she was fired in retaliation for refusing to flout FOIA laws and raising concerns about possible FOIA violations during her tenure.
Connie Clay, the former Richmond FOIA officer, also said in her lawsuit against the city that her former supervisor, then-city director Petula Burks, instructed Clay to withhold information requested under the Act. Burks, who resigned from her role with the city last summer, is also named in the suit filed in March 2024.
On Tuesday, Judge Claire G. Cardwell set the discovery process to begin on May 27 at 11 a.m. The three-day jury trial is to start on Sept. 23. The judge asked both sides to fully cooperate in the process. 
“I understand strong advocacy,” Cardwell told attorneys on Tuesday, as quoted by the Richmonder. “But without pointing fingers in either direction, I would like counsel to start anew.” 
“To the extent you can work together on administrative matters, please do so,” she added.
Richmond attempted to dismiss the case in January, but was denied by Cardwell, according to a report by VPM.
“Although Plaintiff’s Complaint does not explicitly connect her good faith disclosures of suspected wrongdoing to defendants’ retaliation and discrimination toward her, the Court may reasonably infer this alleged conduct flowed from her disclosures of suspected FOIA violations,” Cardwell wrote in her Feb. 5 order. 
 News editor wins in transparency case against Flock Safety

A Roanoke Circuit Court judge recently ruled that the city of Roanoke violated the Freedom of Information Act and is required to fulfill a renewed request for traffic camera footage of Cardinal News Executive Editor Jeff Schwaner’s vehicle, Cardinal News reported.
Schwaner requested information from Flock Safety’s License Plate Reader, which was footage of his car from Roanoke police, on Feb. 21. He filed the same request for 15 other law enforcement agencies. Flock Safety provides the license plate reading hardware and maintains the data.  
In response, the city and the Botetourt County Sheriff’s Office filed a motion in the Roanoke City Circuit Court asking the court to decide whether it was obligated to provide the footage under FOIA.
Another issue raised during the court proceedings is that camera data automatically erases after 30 days. As a result, the data Schwaner sought in February did not exist, the city said.
Judge Leisa Ciaffone “did not find that the city “willfully and knowingly” denied the request in a way that would make it subject to additional penalties that can be assessed when FOIA is violated,”  Cardinal News reported.
However, she dismissed all the city’s arguments for not fulfilling the FOIA request. She also ruled that the FOIA law outweighed local policies and contracts that localities may have with third parties like Flock Safety.
“The court finds that Mr. Schwaner has substantially prevailed on the merits and grants his reasonable attorney’s fees and costs associated with this action,” the judge wrote.
John Koehler, Schwaner’s attorney, told Cardinal News that they are pleased with the court’s ruling that the city must release the data. 
“Transparency in government gathering of data about the public is necessary to assure that the benefit that can be derived from the effort is worth both the expense and the impact on the community,” Koehler said.
Schwaner added that at the core of this request was a single idea: “that the public has as much a right to know what’s going on in public as anybody.”
WDBJ7 did reach out to the city of Roanoke for comment on the case, but the city declined to comment out of deference to the circuit court.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin is considering legislation that would put restrictions on the use and data retention of license plate readers and exempt system data from disclosure. Youngkin has until Friday to rule on the proposal.
 CDC public records staff placed on leave

Congressman Gerry Connolly, D-Va., is requesting information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding why the agency’s public records staff was placed on administrative leave until their jobs are eliminated June 2.
The CDC layoffs come after hundreds of federal workers including health agency workers were fired amid President Donald Trump’s administration’s restructuring of the federal government.
The letter, which was published by NPR and directed to CDC’s acting director Dr. Susan Monarez, states FOIA ensures that the public has a “right” to access federal agency information. Since its enactment in 1967, it has been crucial to ensuring government transparency and accountability.
“As a result, there are currently zero personnel available to process FOIA requests received by CDC,” Connolly wrote in his April 24 letter. “The elimination of staff responsible for facilitating FOIA strongly implies an effort by the administration to prevent the public from obtaining information about their government that they are entitled to request.”
Connolly requested a response by May 8. He announced earlier this week his plans to retire.
 Richmond’s new pump increased fluoridation levels

Richmond water remains safe to drink after the recent installation of a new pump increased fluoridation levels at its treatment plant, the city announced on Monday.
The announcement, made roughly three months after Richmond faced a debilitating water crisis as state lawmakers returned to begin the 2025 General Assembly session in January, leaving thousands without drinking water.
On April 23, the city discovered the fluoride levels did increase, but at no point did samples collected in the distribution system indicate the fluoridation level exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 4.0 mg/L within the region, which is the highest level allowed in drinking water by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The city said the optimal target is 0.7 mg/L. 
Hanover County said in a statement it was “disappointed by the lack of communication” from the city, and that they didn’t learn of the incident until four days later. The locality said the Virginia Department of Emergency Management notified its officials about the fluoride leak on the evening of April 27. In response, Hanover determined through its own testing that its system was well within the MCL with 1.6 ppm.
Mayor Danny Avula, who took office at the start of the year, said in a statement that he was disappointed that the city’s Department of Public Utilities did not notify the Department of Health within the required 24-hour period.
The city said the Department of Public Utilities is creating new state standard operating procedures for the water treatment plant.
“I’m disappointed with our failure to communicate,” Avula said. “This incident damages the work we’re doing to rebuild trust — not only with the residents of Richmond, but our communities, and our regional partners, including Henrico, Chesterfield, and Hanover. We must do better.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia voters can begin casting ballots Friday, May 2, as early voting opens for the June 17 primary elections. These primaries will determine party nominees for key statewide offices and legislative seats ahead of the November general election, which could reshape the state’s political landscape.​
While Virginia’s gubernatorial race between Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger is set, Democrats still have to settle their tickets for lieutenant governor and attorney general.
All 133 Virginia localities will hold a Democratic primary, while just 31 will host a Republican one. Six candidates are competing in the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor:
A labor leader and employment attorney from Northern Virginia, Alex Bastani once juggled law school at night while working as an economist at the U.S. Department of Labor.
Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, made history in 2019 when she became the first Muslim and South Asian American woman elected to the Virginia Senate.
With a background in medicine and education, Dr. Babur Lateef chairs the Prince William County School Board and has led the University of Virginia Health System Board.
State Sen. Aaron Rouse, a Virginia Beach state senator and former NFL safety, won his seat in a 2023 special election.
A former federal prosecutor now practicing law in Arlington, Victor Salgado handled high-profile cases during his tenure, including the prosecution of Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
And Levar Stoney, who served as Richmond’s youngest mayor until January, also held the role of Virginia’s Secretary of the Commonwealth before launching his bid for higher office.
The winner will face Republican nominee John Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay man to run statewide in Virginia. 
Reid’s candidacy has sparked controversy within the GOP after explicit images surfaced online, leading Gov. Glenn Youngkin to request his withdrawal. Reid denies any connection to the images and has vowed to continue his campaign, highlighting internal divisions within the party.​
For attorney general, the Democratic primary features Jay Jones, a former state delegate from Norfolk who in 2021 unsuccessfully challenged then-incumbent Mark Herring for his party’s nomination, and Shannon Taylor, Henrico County’s commonwealth’s attorney. 
Jones, a lifelong Norfolk resident, previously served as an assistant attorney general and represented the 89th District in the House of Delegates. Taylor, first elected in 2011, has emphasized her experience as a prosecutor in her campaign. 
The victor will challenge incumbent Republican Jason Miyares, who is seeking re-election.​
House of Delegates: Competitive primaries across the state
All 100 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates are up for election this year. Democrats currently hold a narrow majority, and both parties are fielding candidates in multiple districts.​
Several Democratic primaries are drawing attention:​

House District 1: Incumbent Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, faces a challenge from Sean Phillip Epstein and Arjoon Srikanth
House District 32: Michael Forbes and Jonathan Michael Lucci are seeking their party’s nomination to challenge Del. Bill Wiley, R-Winchester.
House District 40: Donna Littlepage and Kiesha Preston are running to take on Del. Joe McNamara, R-Roanoke County.
House District 49: Jasmine Lipscomb and Gary Miller are vying for their party’s nomination in a Republican-leaning district currently represented by Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, who is not seeking reelection. 
House District 57: May Nivar and Andrew Schear are seeking to take on Del. David Owen, R-Henrico. 
House District 72: Randolph Critzer and Bilal Raychouni are competing for the chance to challenge Del. Lee Ware, D-Powhatan. 
House District 73: Voters will choose between Leslie Mehta and Justin Woodford to decide who challenges Del. Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield, and independent candidate Michael Talat Saleh Azab.
House District 75: In the most crowded House primary this cycle, Lindsey Dougherty, Stephen Miller-Pitts and Dustin Wade are battling for the opportunity to oppose Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield.
House District 81: Alicia Atkins is taking on Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond. No Republican has filed in this district yet.
House District 89: The primary between Blaizen Buckshot Bloom and Karen Robins Carnegie will decide which Democrat will face the Republican nominee hoping to succeed Del. Baxter Ennis, R-Chesapeake.

Republicans are having primaries in these districts:

House District 21: Gregory Lee Gorham, Xanthe Larsen and Sahar Smith are competing for the chance to unseat Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William. 
House District 37: Austen Schwend is hoping to unseat Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt. If successful, he will face Sharron Burgess, the lone Democrat running in this Republican-leaning district, in the November election.
House District 46: Mitchell Cornett and Adam Tolbert are hoping to face Democrat Jamie Ralston Henry in this district currently represented by Del. Jed Arnold, R-Smyth, who is not seeking reelection. 
House District 49: The primary contest between Vanessa Reynolds Scearce and Madison Whittle will decide who will succeed Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, and face the Democratic nominee who has yet to be selected. 
House District 62: Karen Hamilton and Clay Jackson are competing for the chance to take on Sara Ratcliffe, the lone Democrat running in this district. 
House District 70: The winner between Cynthia Scaturico and Hailey Shupe-Dollar will go up against Del. Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, in November. 
House District 89: Either Mike Lamonea or Kristen Shannon will face the Democratic nominee in a district currently represented by Del. Baxter Ennis, R-Chesapeake, who is not running for reelection. 
House District 97: Former Del. Tim Anderson and Christina Miriam Felder are seeking the Republican nomination to take on Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach.

Voting information and key dates
Virginia conducts open primaries, allowing any registered voter to participate in either party’s primary, though not both. Early voting runs from May 2 through June 14. Voters can cast ballots in person at their local registrar’s office or vote by mail.​
Important deadlines:

May 27: Deadline to register to vote or update registration.
June 6: Deadline to apply for a mailed absentee ballot.
June 14: Last day for in-person early voting.
June 17: Primary Election Day

For more information on early voting locations and to find your polling place, visit the Virginia Department of Elections website.
Voter turnout forecast
In recent years, voter turnout in Virginia’s primary elections has fluctuated, reflecting varying levels of public engagement. For instance, the 2021 Democratic primary saw about 8% of registered voters casting ballots —  a slight decrease from the 10% turnout in 2017, which was one of the highest in recent history. This dip occurred despite the presence of competitive races and increased accessibility to early voting options.
Nationally, primary election turnout often lags behind general elections. Since 2000, average turnout for general elections in the U.S. has been more than twice as high as for primaries. 
This trend suggests that while general elections draw broader participation, primaries are typically decided by a more engaged subset of voters.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Three Virginia Planned Parenthood health centers in Richmond, Hampton and Virginia Beach have been affected by federal Title X family planning grant freezes, losing over $1 million in funds fueling family planning services. 
Established in 1970, the federal program helps low and extremely low-income people access family planning care like contraception, sexually transmitted disease screenings and treatment as well as cancer screenings, at low or no cost. 
Virginia League for Planned Parenthood CEO Paulette McElwain said that clinics in Virginia became aware of the federal funding changes on March 31, which means that about 11,000 patients will now have to pay higher costs for services. 
She added that more than half of the Title X patients that VLPP cares for have incomes at or below the federal poverty level — the demographics that the federal funding program is meant to support. 
“VLPP is working hard to keep costs for patients as low as possible but inevitably, the loss of $1.2 million in funds that directly subsidized family planning services will impact patients,” McElwain said. “It is profoundly disappointing that the Trump administration is putting politics ahead of the health care needs of the people Planned Parenthood serves.” 
The Trump administration is facing a lawsuit over the cuts to the funding. California, Hawaii, Mississippi, Maine, Missouri, Montana and Utah have been completely cut off from the grants, according to the lawsuit, while Alaska, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia have had their access reduced. While costs for care have gone up for patients in Virginia, other states have reported the possibilities of reduced hours, laid off staff or closures of clinics altogether. 
Filed in the District Court of Columbia, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and the American Civil Liberties Union’s 35-page lawsuit argues that about 842,000 people across the affected states now face reduced access to care. With the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. named as the top defendant, the suit argues that HHS has withheld $65.8 million over disagreements about organizations’ “opposition to racism” and speculation of “providing care to undocumented immigrants.”
While legal challenges to changes in reproductive health care access play out at the federal level, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin may soon weigh in on a right-to-contraception bill from this most recent legislative session. After passing the legislature, he sought amendments. 
Youngkin’s substitute of the bill reinforces two U.S. Supreme Court cases that deal with access to contraception nationwide, while the right-to-contraception proposal prior to his substitute would apply specifically to Virginia if those federal cases should be overturned.
After helping overturn federal abortion protections in 2022, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting cases that upheld contraception protections. As some states have also explored contraceptive restrictions in recent years, reproductive rights advocates and some lawmakers in Virginia have emphasized the benefit of strengthening state law, should federal protections for contraception also be overturned.
While the measure also cleared the legislature last year, Youngkin sought amendments that the bill’s patrons said “gutted” it because it reinstated the federal court cases for which protection hinges on before he ultimately vetoed it. 
He has until Friday to choose to sign the bill as it had cleared the legislature this year, or to veto it  again.

As anyone who steps outside of a gated community these days is aware, the number of impoverished and homeless people living on the street is, thanks to our unjust and top heavy economy, way up.
What’s more, providing useful assistance to these people – many of whom struggle with disabilities, mental and physical health challenges and just plain hopelessness — is extremely tough.
Here, however, is one thing we do know from the experts who do this heroic work: passing laws to make life on the street even tougher isn’t a solution.
Unfortunately, that’s where the North Carolina legislature is heading with a bill that would force local governments to criminalize camping or sleeping on public property.
As a Methodist pastor told lawmakers, quote “How can we push down folks who are already down? Seems like it’s impossible, but this bill has figured it out.”
The bottom line: As several advocates told lawmakers, the solution to homelessness lies in a sustained commitment to building a genuine social safety net and ending poverty, not criminalizing people who have no other place to go.

“The Ohio Housing Trust Fund is the primary source of state funding for local homelessness, emergency home repair and affordable housing development,” the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio’s executive director Amy Riegel said during a press conference Thursday. “We see that making any type of change and overhauling it would be drastic and would make huge ripple impacts across the state.”
The trust fund was created in 1991 and is administered by the Ohio Department of Development. It is funded by a portion of the fees collected by county recorders, with half of the fees staying with the county and the other half going back to the fund — which requires at least 50% of the funds be spent in non-urban areas. 
The House budget proposal would remove the requirement for county recorders to send the state Department of Development money to reallocate the funds, making it less effective across the state.
“This would leave counties with only the funds that they are able to collect, which creates a drastic impact on communities where they might not be collecting as many revenues as other counties,” Riegel said. “Shifting to a county-by-county approach will negatively impact folks who are struggling to just keep her roof over their heads.”
Robert Bender, CEO of the Provident Companies, is concerned counties could lose their leveraging ability and wouldn’t have the capacity to administer funds. 
“We have an easy solution: just don’t mess with it,” he said. “This is really elected officials who don’t have enough information trying to tinker with something to make it better when it’s going to make it worse.”
The Housing Trust Fund provided emergency shelter for more than 27,000 Ohioans last year, Riegel said. 
“That’s just one year,” Riegel said. “Multiply that by the last 23 years, and you can see this has a huge impact across our state.” 
Housing advocates asked House lawmakers why the amendment was added, but Riegel said the rationale behind it remains unclear. Now, they are talking to Ohio senators about trying to remove the amendment. 
“We have heard from many of them that they do support removing the language … however, it is the decision of the entire body of how to move forward,” Riegel said.
Habitat for Humanity of Ohio’s Executive Director Ryan Miller said they serve primarily populations of people who have paid off their homes, are living on fixed incomes and dealing with health issues. 
“They have no other option, and we must keep the current funding structure in place to let them live in dignity and peace,” he said. 
The trust fund is one of the most effective tools to reduce homelessness, said Becky Eddy, chief community development officer for the Integrated Services for Behavioral Health. 
“The current regional approach isn’t broken,” she said. “Shifting to a fractured county-by-county model would slow things down, drive the administrative costs and ultimately increase homelessness across the state.”

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
States Battle Big Tech Over Data Privacy Laws

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
DNA Databases Are Boon to Police But Menace to Privacy, Critics Say

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-02 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Insurance costs threaten CT foster care providers,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/02/insurance-costs-threaten-ct-foster-care-providers/,Nonprofits that run foster care programs in CT are facing rising insurance costs that they say could force them to end those programs.,"Connecticut nonprofits that run foster care programs for some of the state’s highest-need children are facing rising insurance costs that could force them to discontinue those programs, providers said.
In 2022, the federal government passed a law that removed the statute of limitations for lawsuits related to child sex abuse, meaning providers can face civil action decades after the abuse occurred. The law aims to provide justice to victims.
But foster care programs across the country say insurance companies are citing the law as a reason to end long-standing liability insurance contracts or drastically increase costs of those coverage plans.
“My agency is 100 years old,” said Chris Lacey, chief executive of the Waterford Country School. “I have the responsibility to make sure it lasts about another 100 years, and if foster care is too risky for insurance carriers to get into, maybe it’s too risky for me to get into.”
Lacey’s agency manages a therapeutic foster home program under a contract with the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. The school also has special education programming and runs a Specialized Trauma-Informed Treatment Assessment and Reunification, or STTAR, home which is meant to be a shelter and respite treatment program for children with severe behavioral issues.
Therapeutic foster homes have been used as a way to keep children out of more restrictive settings such as inpatient psychiatric care. Foster parents in these settings are trained to support children with serious mental health conditions. Between 400 and 600 children in Connecticut are in therapeutic foster care.
The Waterford Country School has gotten its liability insurance through the same company for years. They’ve never had a claim on the policy, but the insurance company told them a few weeks ago that they were no longer covering foster care programs.
Eric Goldberg, an attorney with the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said insurers are seeing more courts and juries finding providers liable in lawsuits and plaintiff attorneys making requests for a quick decision.
The requests often mean that the plaintiffs’ attorneys are asking for a final decision on a case before the insurance company has had time to investigate, Goldberg said. There are also more awards offered than in past years for pain and suffering, he said.
“Carriers, in an abundance of caution, often are settling cases that they may ordinarily have litigated, or at least sat down and had a conference with another party to be able to exchange the information that was needed,” Goldberg said.
Few insurance companies provide this type of insurance, so options are limited, Lacey said. His agency’s foster care contract is for about $1 million, he said, and it could be facing annual insurance payments that cost half of that contract.
New Britain-based Klingberg Family Centers has seen modest increases on its insurance premiums of 3-5% in recent years. This year, the costs increased by about eight-fold annually for less coverage. The nonprofit had a $10 million umbrella policy and had to drop that to about $2 million, chief executive Steven Girelli said.
The family centers have never had a claim, Girelli said.
“I don’t think we, or any of the foster care providers can absorb this dramatic increase in cost and increase in risk exposure indefinitely,” Girelli said. “It’s just, for us, it would be untenable.”
The Village for Families and Children’s insurance costs have increased from about $300,000 in 2021 to nearly $1 million annually this year, and they’re expecting more increases, chief executive officer Hector Glynn said.
Providers met with state officials from DCF and Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration last month to inform them of the issue.
Mary Quinn, a spokesperson for the state’s Insurance Department, said the agency is “actively engaged,” in discussions to address this issue and that Senate Bill 1322, which is under consideration by state lawmakers, would require the agency to study the insurance market issues for nonprofit providers.
“The Connecticut Insurance Department (CID) is aware of the challenges foster care providers are facing in securing affordable and adequate liability insurance and understands the urgency of this issue,” Quinn said in a written statement.
Providers said the foster care system, which is already strained, could break down further without the nonprofit programming.
Nonprofits across the country are being forced to close because they can’t get liability insurance, and in some states foster care providers can’t find any insurers who are willing to offer policies, according to a March report from the American Enterprise Institute.
Lawsuits and “bad public policy,” have driven insurance costs up, outpacing inflation, according to the report.
Lacey said there are a couple of steps the state or federal government can take to fix the problem, including establishing special liability protections for foster care providers. It could also establish a government-backed or captive insurer created only to insure foster care programs.
The American Enterprise Institute report also recommended establishing a compensation fund to provide one-time payments to victims.
The state is in the early phases of figuring out what to do.
Glynn said the state needs to find a solution, and soon. Nonprofits can endure the financial loss temporarily, but not forever, and smaller organizations may struggle in the immediate term, he said.
“It’s just getting to the point that the increases are unsustainable,” Glynn said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180201_114127.jpg,,,2025-05-02 06:03:36.549319

Last year, almost a quarter (22%) of births in New Hampshire were covered by Medicaid, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report."" (Getty Images)When a child walks through our doors at Waypoint, we don’t just see a case file — we see a future. One that could be bright if that child has the necessary tools they need to grow up healthy, safe, and strong. One of the most powerful tools we have to make that future possible is Medicaid and its expansion through the Granite Advantage Program. 
Right now, that critical lifeline is at risk.
At Waypoint, we work every day with families facing poverty, trauma, and mental health challenges. We see firsthand how access to Medicaid transforms lives — not just for children, but for entire families. It’s no exaggeration to say that Medicaid is one of the most important investments we can make to ensure New Hampshire’s children grow up healthy, stable, and ready to succeed.
Medicaid’s impact starts before a child even takes their first breath. Last year, almost a quarter (22%) of births in New Hampshire were covered by Medicaid, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report. That coverage means access to prenatal care that reduces complications and improves birth outcomes leading to healthier babies and mothers.
And the support doesn’t end there. Today, roughly 1 in 4 children in New Hampshire is enrolled in Medicaid, making children the largest group Medicaid serves. It covers doctor visits, dental and vision care, immunizations, mental health services, and critical care for children with complex needs or a history of trauma. For children in foster care, Medicaid is a guarantee — offering stability to those who need it most.
Yet the state budget bill now being considered by the New Hampshire Legislature proposes drastic changes to the Medicaid and other programs that are unnecessary, concerning and potentially damaging to the health of children and families. The House-approved budget includes a 3% rate cut to Medicaid providers along with reductions in funding for mental health, community health, and public health programs. It would even eliminate the Office of the Child Advocate, a critical partner to our staff who rely on that office for independent oversight in complex and high-risk cases involving child safety. 
Beyond the budget, a proposal to impose a work requirement for adults in the Granite Advantage Program would very likely cut off access to care for many current enrollees, because of the administrative burdens it will impose. And Medicaid cuts under consideration at the federal level could eliminate Granite Advantage entirely, forcing all 60,000 individuals on the program to lose their health insurance coverage.
And when parents lose coverage, children suffer. Research consistently shows that children are more likely to be insured and receive regular checkups and timely care when their parents have access to health insurance. 
Medicaid is also a shield against financial disaster. By covering essential services and reducing out-of-pocket costs, Medicaid helps families stay afloat. Without it, an unexpected illness can become a life-altering crisis. Families risk losing their homes. Parents can lose their jobs. And children — caught in the storm — lose their safety, support, and stability.
Medicaid and the Granite Advantage Program are also one of our most effective tools in addressing the growing mental health crisis. New Hampshire has some of the highest rates of childhood behavioral and mental health disorders in the country. Untreated mental health conditions in parents are linked to poor developmental outcomes for children. Medicaid helps break this cycle by ensuring access to mental health care for both parents and kids, supporting more resilient and healthier families.
The evidence is clear: traditional Medicaid and the Granite Advantage Program are a game-changer for New Hampshire’s children. We cannot afford to lose or limit the benefits Medicaid provides to our New Hampshire children and families. We should be strengthening the systems that help families weather life’s storms, not reducing them when they are most needed. 
In New Hampshire, we pride ourselves on being a place where families come first. We say we value our children. But values mean nothing without action — especially when the well-being of our kids is on the line. 
So, we must ask ourselves: What kind of New Hampshire do we want to be? A place where every child has a chance to thrive? Or one that turns its back on its most vulnerable?
Let’s choose the healthier path forward. Let’s invest in New Hampshire’s children by supporting Medicaid and the Granite Advantage Program.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/medicaidumbrella-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 05:02:12.862054

Just two months ago, the president’s approval rating was six points higher than disapproval. Now he’s under water.
Although job approval is a different question than who to back in an election, it’s a notable deficit for someone who won the state by 11 points last November.

“Consistent with many national polls, we find that Trump has lost considerable support over his first 100 days, suggesting his honeymoon was short-lived,” Bowling Green State University political scientist Robert Alexander said. “Having a net negative favorability rating in a state he won by 11 points should be of concern for Trump nationwide.”
Alexander also said if the numbers continue to slide, “we can expect the hopes of Democrats in Ohio to increase as they look to the 2026 election.”
The data comes from a poll conducted by BGSU’s Democracy and Public Policy Network. Pollsters contacted 800 registered voters from April 18-24 and the poll has a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points. The bulk of their contacts were people they previously polled in February; 235 respondents had not been contacted before.
Voter’s impression of the first 100 days
The April survey shows Trump’s base of supporters remains intact, while independents and Democrats are disenchanted with his performance.
On a handful of broad qualitative question regarding respect for the country abroad, anxiety levels of respondent and whether Trump’s performance has compared to expectations, the negative responses led, but fell short of a majority.
BGSU political scientist Melissa Miller said, despite Republicans’ 2024 double-digit victory in Ohio, “Trump administration policies appear to be a mixed bag in the Buckeye State.”
A majority of respondents supported federal recognition of only two sexes, and declaring an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. But most respondents opposed renaming the Gulf of Mexico, withdrawing from the World Health Organization and pardoning Jan. 6 defendants.
Tariff policy, however, was a glaring exception. A majority opposed Trump’s 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, but offered support for a 10% tariff on China. As of April 9, the import duties on most Chinese goods sit at 145%. According to the White House some goods will face a 245% tariff.
By a 2-to-1 margin, the poll’s respondents said tariffs will hurt them personally, and 49% said the policy will hurt the United States. Just 38% said tariffs will be beneficial for the country. Respondents were also dubious about who stands to gain from the policy. Sixty percent said the benefits will flow to the wealthy and large corporations. Meanwhile, majorities agreed that tariffs will harm small businesses, labor unions, the middle class, the working class, and the car industry.
“No matter how you look at it,” Alexander said, “Ohio voters do not like what they are seeing with Trump’s tariff policies.”
Peeking ahead to 2026
Pollsters asked about the upcoming governor’s race, as well. Among Republican candidates, entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy leads the field by a vast margin. Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel and Attorney General Dave Yost garnered 14% and 13% support respectively, while Ramaswamy has the backing of 64% of GOP voters.
All three Republican candidates have an edge over the only declared Democratic candidate, former Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton. The poll suggests Acton, a first-time candidate, has work to do consolidating Democratic support. Given the choice, 59% of respondents said they’d prefer former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown as the nominee to Acton’s 20%. Former U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan got 16% of the total.
Miller argued there are warning signs in their figures about distrust in the federal government. Among Republicans, that figure ticked upwards slightly, but within the margin of error. For Democrats and independents the increase was larger.
“While rising distrust in the federal government among Ohio Democrats is not particularly surprising,” Miller argued, “the 8-point increase in distrust among independents between February and April could have real consequences. Independents tend to be the holy grail in U.S. elections.”

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio Retirement Study Council leaders are evaluating whether or not to remove the voting rights of teachers on their retirement pension fund board.
This comes after a year of controversy in which elected educators are accused of participating in a $65 billion corruption scheme. The board chair denies all allegations, and some retired educators are accusing the Statehouse Republicans of trying to stop transparency.
“It’s not a radical idea to think about how other teacher retirement boards are comprised,” state Rep. Adam Bird (R-New Richmond) said.
Bird, the chair of the Ohio Retirement Study Council, is considering all options when it comes to changing the makeup of the State Teachers Retirement System board.
But for him, the timing of the change isn’t due to the recent spending of $2 billion to restore a 1.5% cost-of-living adjustment.
“I’m concerned that the STRS current composition of seven teachers and four appointed investment experts appears to be imbalanced, which can lead to a perception of lack of fiduciary responsibility,” Bird said.
For the past year, controversy has been swirling inside the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS), a roughly $100 billion pension fund for the more than 500,000 active and retired public educators in Ohio.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
The scandal centers around former board member Wade Steen, board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum, and their relationship with investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
How we got here
In May 2024, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo, alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The document claims that QED — despite having no clients and no track record — tried to convince STRS members to partner with them.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThey couldn’t impress the board members, mainly because of their lack of experience and because QED was not registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser. The men also didn’t own the technology to “facilitate the strategy,” the documents said.
So what exactly are Steen and Fichtenbaum trying to change, and what would QED allegedly attempt to do? Revise the investment structure.
The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.” This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money; through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund. Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
Attorney General Dave Yost later filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract-steering “scheme” that could directly benefit them. Yost started the investigation after the memo – now known to have been prepared by STRS employees – alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been doing the bidding of QED.
Reporting by WEWS/OCJ has included the first time Yost and QED spoke about it, and continued with dozens of reports on the topic. A September investigation revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly lacked experience and personal ties to the board leaders, according to senior staff. After the reporting, the board chose not to move forward with the firm that has been the subject of the news investigations.
Restructuring
Bird’s move is the first step in changing state law. Other Republican leaders are arguing that, due to the scandal, the elected teachers on the board should be removed or they should be non-voting members.
“There’s been an attempt to circumvent the long-standing evaluation process that STRS has for evaluating investment strategies,” the study council chair continued.
Retired teacher Robin Rayfield is appalled by the idea of removing the elected members from the board.
“We’re not in favor of them changing the board, except if they were eliminating appointed positions,” Rayfield said. “As retired educators, we believe in democracy.”
The educator runs the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, ORTA, an organization currently under investigation along with Rayfield.
Due to his close relationships with both Steen, Fichtenbaum and QED, Rayfield’s conversations have been subpoenaed by the attorney general. He was also reported to the Ohio Ethics Commission due to his financial donations to board members. He put together a fund in 2023 to pay Steen’s legal fees, with additional funds being added to help both Steen and Fichtenbaum’s litigation against Yost. ORTA has donated more than $163,000, according to financial forms.
The STRS memo claims QED and ORTA had worked together, specifically when it came to elections, to get a more sympathetic — or willing — board.
Rayfield said that the investigation is a sham and a way for the state to stop transparency.
“It’s clear that the folks in Ohio in power — they want more power,” Rayfield said. “They don’t want people having the opportunity to represent themselves.”
He said it isn’t fair to use the argument that they don’t trust the board to follow their fiduciary duty due to the board’s alleged continued interest in QED.
“That’s a straw man,” Rayfield said. “The QED thing has been dead since ’21.”
The STRS chair was asked in August whether he was still considering QED.
“I don’t know at this point,” Fichtenbaum responded. “I think that the idea that they had about earning fees is not a bad idea.”
Also, Rayfield allegedly called interim STRS Executive Director Aaron Hood in April to discuss QED, according to a public records request.
In an email to the board, Hood wrote:
“Yesterday afternoon I received a telephone call from Robin Rayfield at ORTA. Robin offered to set up a meeting for me with representatives of QED (including Seth Metcalf) since there is so much “controversy.” I was so taken aback that I stepped out of my office and asked him to acknowledge his request again on speakerphone so that other staff could hear his confirmation of the request. I informed him that I will not meet with anyone related to QED and encouraged him to read the AG’s filings (including exhibits) involving communications from QED to a former board member. To be clear, no STRS staff will be meeting with representatives of QED and I would advise you all as board members to avoid any such meetings as well, especially in light of the pending outside litigation.”
Despite all of this, Rayfield and the “reformers” argue that there is nothing wrong with questioning the status quo — and that this is clearly a targeted attack at public education.
“It’s more political talk; When they’ve spent a billion dollars on private education and ignored public education, reduced the budget for public education, attacked our pension — all of the forces of everything — the governor, the attorney general, all of the high ranking elected officials, it has been to diminish what our public service has been through — decades of neglect and abuse,” Rayfield said.
The Ohio House Republicans passed a budget that dramatically slashed school funding. To be fully funded based on statistics from the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021, schools would need $666 million. The proposed budget only gives them about $226 million.
Based on 2025 numbers and inflation, the amount of money to fund K-12 would be closer to $800 million, new data from public school advocates like former lawmaker John Patterson found.
Retired educator Mary Binegar, who doesn’t trust the “reform” faction of the board, still says that removing the teachers’ voices is a bad move.


“Whether we like the board members (that) are there or not, we do have the opportunity to vote for them,” Binegar. “I think it’s important for educators to have that sense that there are other educators watching out for them.”

When Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, was asked about his interest in pension reform, he said he aims to pass some changes to the pension board by the end of June.
“I wanna see what those recommendations are going to be,” Huffman said. “The problem, conceptually, with pensions… it’s trying to solve a problem now that looms many years in the future, it’s difficult for people to understand.”
Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, shared similar sentiments when I asked him about pension reform. He said he has had a few conversations with the Retirement Study Council leaders.
“I do think it’s worth reminding folks, whenever you’re on a pension board, you are acting with fiduciary duties to the pensioners in that pension system,” McColley said. “It’s important that they remember that the decisions they make shouldn’t just be based on a particular policy that they want to move forward or a particular message that they want to send, but rather it should be based on getting the best return at the appropriate profile for that pension system.”
House Minority Leader Allison Russo slammed the Republicans when asked for her thoughts.
“You’ve got a pension system that represents retired workers, but you don’t want to have workers represented on the board? I think (that) speaks to, again, lack of accountability in how individual retirement systems are run, the long-term stability of them.” Russo said. “And if you don’t want voices of those retired workers — I think that’s wrong and that’s hugely problematic.”
No matter the scandal, and no matter the side, each educator who spoke on the matter said that removing their perspective from the board will hurt the fund and cause teachers to feel isolated and unheard.

The national championship-winning Ohio State University football team played Michigan State University last season.
But it was a game you could only watch on Peacock, NBC’s streaming service — something that OSU fan and state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, was angry about.
“I don’t have streaming services because, again, I can’t afford to spend all that on the streaming service,” he said. “The fact that I wasn’t able to watch an Ohio State game about killed me.”
In recent years, streaming services have been getting exclusive contracts to broadcast college athletics. If you don’t pay for the services, you don’t get to watch.
DeMora said this adds up, since the Big 10 has a deal with Peacock and the Middle Atlantic Conference (MAC) has one with ESPN subsidiaries ESPN+ and ESPNU.
This could be especially difficult for people who can’t access or don’t have high-speed internet, he said.
“They can’t watch streaming TV even if they wanted to pay the extra money for it,” he continued.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXSince DeMora is not only a fan, but also a state senator, he introduced Senate Bill 94, which would prohibit public universities from giving exclusive broadcasting rights to a streaming service.
“The streams were lagging, pixelated, out of sync and plagued by poor audio quality,” DeMora said during recent testimony on the bill. “People were paying for something that was horrible quality to start.”
WEWS/OCJ reached out to both the BIG 10 and MAC conferences, the different streaming services and their owners — as well as OSU, Kent State and the University of Akron.
Akron said they didn’t have a comment yet, and Kent declined to comment. But Ohio State did chime in.
“Media rights agreements are negotiated by the Big Ten on behalf of all conference members, and broadcast rights for specific athletic events are controlled by the designated media partner in accordance with the larger media rights agreement,” OSU spokesperson Ben Johnson said.
State Rep. Josh Williams (R-Sylvania) said this was a “kind of stupid” bill.
“Imagine the Buckeyes not being part of the Big 10 anymore because a simple piece of legislation said you can’t sign up to a streaming deal,” Williams said. “I think it’s ill-advised, ill-conceived and it won’t get any support.”
This bill could hurt the schools, he added.
“You’re going to stop universities from a revenue stream that they can generate off of their athletic programs that they use to reinvest into their athletic facilities,” the Republican said.
The legislation would also allow students to watch broadcasts for free. The legislation would require state universities to provide enrolled students access, but it is up to the school’s discretion how that is implemented.
Johnson explained that Peacock does give a student discount. Right now, the premium subscription for students is $2.99 per month for a year, down from $7.99. Once a year passes, students will have to pay $7.99 per month.
“Having to pay extra to watch their teammates and classmates’ sporting events isn’t fair to them,” DeMora argued.
Williams disagreed with this argument and the Democrat’s frustration with the cost in general.
“That’s like saying someone can’t afford the purchase of a television, so therefore games shouldn’t be televised,” Williams said.
The general public is with him on what he calls the streaming epidemic, DeMora said.
“It’s not fair to the everyday fan,” he said.
The bill will be subject to more hearings in the coming weeks.
Both DeMora and Williams have proposed football-related legislation. The Democrat proposed a bill that would prevent state money from going towards professional sports teams that have losing records. Williams, in the last General Assembly, introduced a bill that would make planting a flag in the center of the Ohio Stadium football field illegal. He proposed this after a brawl broke out when University of Michigan players tried to plant a flagpole after they beat OSU.

In a masterpiece of social media, Sheriff Eric Kirsch invited teens to call law enforcement if they are ""drunk as hell"" and need a ride home. (Wabaunsee County Sheriff’s Office)Hey teenagers: do you have a cool adult who you trust to drive you home after you get drunk?
If not, the Wabaunsee County Sheriff’s Office wants to be that person. That’s the message from a post that the Kansas sheriff posted Wednesday to Instagram and Facebook.
Using a few hundred words (and a handful of emojis), Sheriff Eric Kirsch invited teens to call law enforcement if they need a sober driver: “SO….in WABAUNSEE COUNTY KANSAS if you’re drunk as hell & under 21 & need to get home safe, you can call us & we’ll get you home safe.”
For the “young adults” who accepted the offer, he promised not to cite them with a minor in possession of alcohol.
The post is a masterpiece of social media, attracting more than 1 million views in the first few hours. Kirsch hopes teens think, “Wait a minute guys, let’s call the Sheriff’s Office” after a night of Jägerbombs and Bongzillas. In the process, the message charmingly zigzags all over the place.
Kirsch morbidly opens with the military and law enforcement resumes of the department’s officers, complete with all caps at all the wrong moments, by listing “HORRIFIC crimes like homicides,” “a serial killer” and “decades in and out of combat zones.” One jarring sentence lists, “child molestation & online child crimes investigations, busted up PEDOPHILE NETWORKS & other sinister human trafficking syndicates.”
The perfect words to convince a tipsy teenager to stagger into a police cruiser? Nope.
After that wobbly start, Kirsch gets down to business by offering teenagers a ride home “if you’re drunk as hell.” I think most college-town Uber drivers would tell you the clean-up risk of wasted first-time drinkers. Teenagers often volunteer the alcohol they just drank right back to the world. Puke clean up is a startling new job responsibility that the sheriff is possibly assigning his deputies. Here’s hoping Wabaunsee County has invested in rubber floor mats.
This is a good moment to inspect the photo that accompanied the words. The top of the image has the badge of the department against the black Kansas sky. At the center, a law enforcement officer smiles — a flashlight, handgun and body camera strapped to his vest. His thumbs-up gesture is mimicked, with varying levels of enthusiasm, by a few of the teens who flank him. Their faces appear to be lit by the strobing lights of a sheriff’s cruiser.
The teenagers are perfectly Midwest. Their hoodies advertise Coors beer and the Bank of the Flint Hills, brands that likely don’t appreciate these product placements alongside teen drinking, thank you very much. The boys mostly wear baseball caps, while one girl stands uneasily near the middle, nervously hinging her OnCloud sneaker in the gravel.
At the center of the photo is the contraband: plastic bags from WalMart and Dollar General, filled with empty cans of Mike’s Hard Lemonade and other alcohol. The sheriff reveals that they had also been drinking beers and Boone’s Farm Wine, the archetypal teen garbage swill. He writes: “HORRIBLE BOONES FARM WINE (that’s basically engine degreaser dudes, you should be ashamed of yourselves )”. It’s a standard and cringey aside that signals: “You can trust me! I’ve been a young drinker before.”
(Only slightly more likely to appeal to 2025 teens? The sheriff’s office replied to its own post with a song from 2007, when many of them had yet to be born.)
If these words aren’t convincing teens, Kirsch next tries compassion, and it’s a heavy, heartfelt dose: “I’m tired of carrying people off the roadway in the aftermath of entirely avoidable tragedy.” There’s a bit of patriotism swirled in as Kirsch calls teens “the future leaders of this Great Nation & we NEED AND WANT you ALL to succeed.”
For anyone who has coached, taught or mentored young people, this post presents a familiar conundrum: In order to keep teenagers safe, we need them to trust us adults.
Does that trust come through showing them expertise by listing law enforcement accomplishments?
Does that trust come through showing them compassion by reminding them, as Kirsch write, that, “We’re here for you dudes, even if you’re not quite there for yourself yet ”?
Does that trust come through the legal forgiveness of a sheriff overlooking the misdemeanor crime of a drunk teenager?
Kirsch admits that there is no perfect formula to eliminate teen drinking. He writes: “People are going to party, prohibition doesn’t work yet providing options does. We provide this option so all lives on the road may benefit.”
Of course, prohibition of alcohol — whether for teens or an entire country — doesn’t work. But that distracts from how these free rides gently sanction teen drinking. The sober rides are a slight but very public enabling.
However, Kirsch’s stated goal is to create safe roadways that are free of drunk teenage drivers. If that is his mission, this impromptu policy announced on social media works as a step in that direction. The subtle permission for teen drinkers simply might be a necessary cost.
When I was a high school teacher, my student journalists interviewed a child psychologist about teen drinking. They asked, “If parents drink with their teenagers in controlled ways during high school, is that a good way to minimize alcohol abuse later in life?” The psychologist was flummoxed by the question. No, she said, drinking early in life is a leading indicator of later alcohol abuse, so any implicit approval for it is consequential, especially during teenage years.
The comment section on Facebook voices this exact worry: “Thanks for encouraging underage drinking…. No more Ubers the wabunsee (sic) sheriff’s office will do it free of charge and listen to your drunken dreams and goals yay good job guys ”
Is the sheriff smartly trading tipsy teen drivers for teens who feel liberated to be “drunk as hell”?
Another anecdote from my high school teaching days provides my personal answer. Each October I supervised the fall dance with about 700 students celebrating in the school gymnasium.
A few hours into the dance, students literally leaned against the doors, eager to start partying in basements with their own bottles of Boone’s Farm. After I released the students and after the chaperones left, I sat in the bleachers of the gymnasium surrounded by drooping streamers and deflated balloons. The DJ packed his speakers into the back of his van. Through the open doors, traffic whirred past.
That’s when I would hear the sirens.
I bowed my head. I hoped the police car wasn’t responding to the accident of a drunk student driver. I sometimes prayed in those moments to keep all of those young people safe.
The ones I worried about the most had driven themselves to the dance, packing into sedans with corsages on their wrists and beers in their bellies. “Please keep them safe,” I thought.
The ones I worried about less? Students who wobbled onto party buses with drivers to deliver them home. Or students who arranged rides with parents. If they insisted on drinking, at least they would be safe.
So, I hear you, Sheriff Kirsch. In the realm of teen drinking, there is no silver bullet (Well, maybe one). There is only ambiguity and a hope for safety.

A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the […]","Apartments and stores under construction in Rapid City, S.D., in 2023. New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.
Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.













A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing.


– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America





Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

(Stock photo by Lourdes Balduque/Getty Images)As the recipient of Nebraska’s largest Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership grant, we’ve made a promise: to show up with care, consistency and compassion, especially when families face the toughest of times. Our work with CRCC, CSI, Educare Lincoln and Educare of Omaha, Inc., brings more than 200 combined years of experience in serving Nebraska’s children and their families.
The federally funded Head Start program is part of that promise, one that has received bipartisan support year after year. But in recent weeks, news broke about a federal budget proposal that would zero out funding for Head Start in 2026. It is impossible to state the impact this move would have on nearly 800,000 children and their families nationwide. 
Congress has the power to decide what gets funded and what doesn’t. That’s where we need to act.
Nebraska impact
In Nebraska, Head Start funding supports the capacity for 5,653 eligible children, employing 2,187 staff in 179 child care centers across the state. These are not just numbers. These are real Nebraska children and families with real futures. And now, the funding to support them is at real risk. 
For 60 years, this nationally recognized, locally rooted program has given our most vulnerable children a safe, developmentally rich environment to learn and grow while their parents work to achieve economic self-sufficiency. The National Head Start Association’s 2025 Nebraska Head Start Profile shows that 4,137 parents of enrolled children were employed, in school or in job training, which would not be possible without reliable child care through Head Start.
Protecting Head Start is essential to the well-being of children, families, and communities. Any move away from this risks consequences we can’t afford. We don’t use these words lightly.
Head Start is a vital foundation for families working to build a better future. It offers reliable support for parents and strong, nurturing early education for children — along with meals, vision and hearing screenings, developmental assessments, and dental care. 
Stability for children and families
Protecting Head Start means preserving stability, opportunity and access to care for at-risk children and over a million parents who rely on it to stay in the workforce. Communities nationwide depend on it as a cornerstone of their child and family support systems.
Head Start works. Not because it’s easy — but because it’s essential. It’s a federal program with decades of data, bipartisan support and consistent, community-driven results. It combines local donations with state and federal funds to provide exactly what Nebraska families need: dependable, comprehensive quality child care. 
Given Head Start’s proven return and essential impact, the conversations in Congress and in our communities should be about increasing funding, not eliminating it. The return on investment is clear.
Nobel Laureate economist James Heckman found that every dollar invested in quality early childhood programs like Head Start returns more than seven dollars in reduced crime, improved health and increased earnings. Supporting Head Start is not just a moral imperative. It’s a smart economic one. 
Investments in future 
How much does the country invest? Head Start funding accounts for 0.18% of the FY2024 federal budget.
Head Start funding strengthens our work as long-standing early childhood partners in Nebraska. We know these families. We work alongside them. We see the deep commitment to their children and their dreams for their families’ futures, many of which would not be possible without help from Head Start.
As a state that values hard work, personal responsibility and community, Nebraskans should encourage congressional support for this invaluable program. When we talk about Nebraska family values, we do not abandon our youngest citizens when they need us most.
We call on our elected officials, neighbors, friends and fellow Nebraskans — from Lincoln to Scottsbluff, Omaha to Ogallala — to speak up. Let your voice be heard. Speak up. Share this message. Remind Washington that Nebraska protects its children. 
Let’s ensure that, as Head Start celebrates 60 years of impact this May, the gift we give back is unwavering support. Because when we invest in children, we invest in us all.

Gavin Newsom contrasted federal efficiency cuts with his use of AI to improve state government. But California's record of using technology has been poor.,"Gov. Gavin Newsom staged a news conference in Los Angeles this week to tout the adoption of artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of state government.
That’s pretty dull stuff, so Newsom goosed its news value by contrasting California’s AI program with President Donald Trump’s slashes of federal services via his Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Newsom’s erstwhile pal, industrialist and inventor Elon Musk.
“I could have easily come in here with sunglasses and chainsaws — you know where I’m going — and gotten your attention,” Newsom told reporters. “We’re DOGE but better.” 
He took another potshot at Trump and Musk, saying, “They haven’t come close to the savings they’ve asserted. I think it’s been very damaging.”
Newsom’s remarks on Trump, Musk and DOGE represent his latest political repositioning, from a harsh critic after Trump recaptured the White House, to making nice with Trump as the state sought $40 billion in wildfire recovery grants, to entertaining prominent pro-Trump figures on his new podcast, and now to reclaiming the role of resistor-in-chief after taking heat from other Democrats for cozying up to Trump.
Newsom contrasting DOGE with California’s AI is not just a metaphoric stretch. Whether the latter will lead to an existential improvement in state government efficiency is open to question.
“GenAI is here,” Newsom said about generative AI, “and it’s growing in importance every day. We know that state government can be more efficient, and as the birthplace of tech it is only natural that California leads in this space. In the Golden State, we know that efficiency means more than cutting services to save a buck, but instead building and refining our state government to better serve all Californians.”
The state’s initial employment of the new technology will help improve highway congestion, traffic safety and services in the Department of Tax and Fee Administration, he said.
Will it?
The state’s sorry record of  implementing information technology prior to the emergence of AI as a tool warrants skepticism. 
Although Newsom wrote “Citizenville,” a book touting technology as a transformative factor in government, state tech projects have not fared well during his governorship, essentially continuing a record of failures and setbacks than began many years ago.
There’s another aspect of Newsom’s new embrace of AI that’s also troubling because of the state’s spotty record on tech — a change in the way the state implements AI projects that could make it more difficult for legislators and the public to know whether they are working as promised.
Coincidentally or not, as Newsom was touting AI in Los Angeles, the Legislature’s budget analyst was issuing a report that raises red flags.

Commentary 
California’s list of failed tech projects just added an agency 

by Dan Walters 





The topic is wonkish to the max, but basically the state is changing the way it approves certain types of technology projects. 
It has been using a contracting and implementation process aimed at providing a whole picture of technology projects as funds are sought from the Legislature, but Newsom’s new process would do the projects in phases, and “Some information currently available … such as a project’s total baseline cost, schedule, and scope might not be as readily available (in the new system) while other information might be made confidential sooner during project planning,” the Legislative Analyst’s Office is telling the Legislature.
Implicitly the LAO report is warning the Legislature that a project’s shortcomings might not be known until it is too late to stop its adoption. “Therefore, to help the Legislature evaluate and understand the new process over a more reasonable time frame, we recommend the Legislature require reporting on completed project planning activities, and limit the new process to a small subset of projects (with additional reporting) over the next fiscal year.”
Complex though it may be, the change in implementation could result in even worse tech disasters than keeping the current process.

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderShelby Hutton was a biologist studying sexually transmitted diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was planning to expand her gonorrhea research by starting doctoral studies in the fall.
But in early April, Hutton found herself suddenly unemployed and applying for a job at Starbucks.
As a scientist, Hutton said she had not expected to find herself among the legions of federal workers abruptly fired as part of the Trump administration’s plan to shrink the federal government through mass firings. 
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to slash 10,000 job in late March, including 2,400 jobs at the CDC. 
“Hundreds of good scientists and subject matter experts were among the cuts to federal employees,” Hutton said while standing outside the CDC in Atlanta. “This is the exact opposite of what RFK said would happen. I’ll be the first to say that there is a lot of improvement to be had in terms of government efficiency, but I really can’t picture a functional CDC without laboratorians.”

Hutton said she was in the middle of validating tests her team had developed for the molecular surveillance of gonorrhea that is resistant to antibiotics – work she said she doesn’t know of other labs doing – when she received the email dismissing her and her entire laboratory branch.
They didn’t have time to properly store specimens that Hutton described as “priceless.” 
To Hutton, it feels like the deep cuts at the CDC are part of a backlash to the COVID-19 pandemic and lingering anger among some over shutdowns and other safety measures taken to control the spread of the virus. 
“It absolutely feels like we’re the scapegoats. It feels like we’re being attacked,” Hutton said. “And I don’t think people realize how important the work that we do is and how much we care about the work we do in public health.” 
The Office of Personnel Management and the CDC did not respond to questions about the actual number of dismissals since February. 
Tuesday marked Trump’s 100th day in office, but the president has already seen his approval rating suffer in Georgia – a state he won last year after narrowly losing here in 2020.
Trump’s approval rating among Georgia voters is at 43%, according to a poll released Wednesday by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and conducted by the University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs.

Anger over the cuts to the CDC has shown up at town halls, protests, press conferences and rallies outside the center’s Atlanta campus. Navy blue signs saying “Save the CDC” and “Save Public Health” can be seen in Atlanta front yards. 
And signs of dissatisfaction with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to reduce the size of the federal government are also reflected in the AJC’s poll.
A slight majority of the poll’s respondents – 51.5% – said they disapprove of those efforts to reduce the size of the government, many of them saying they strongly disapprove. Only 44% said they approved, with 4.5% unsure. The cuts were not popular with the independent voters polled, with about 55% of them frowning on the efforts.
But 74% of Republican voters surveyed said they enthusiastically back the cuts.
‘Everybody knows that you need CDC’
Sarah Boim, a former communication specialist at the CDC, says she is trying to remain hopeful that the wave of legal challenges in response to the cuts to the federal workforce will lead to her and many of her colleagues getting their jobs back. 
But Boim is also not waiting around to see if that happens.
She and other CDC workers who lost their jobs have formed a group called Fired But Fighting. What started out as a newsletter to disseminate accurate information to workers trying to figure out their next steps has quickly evolved into a broader effort to push back on the cuts through spirited advocacy. 
“We just need people to know how important it is to have public health managed at a federal level,” Boim said. “You cannot privatize public health. You need the money that a government has. You need the money of a country – we’re talking about B with billions – and you also need to be able to coordinate across the states. And you just can’t do that in a private company or an organization.”

Fired But Fighting made a splash at Sen. Jon Ossoff’s recent town hall in Marietta, where they pressed the senator to do more to push back on the Trump administration.
The Democrat responded by saying the future of the nation’s public health infrastructure ultimately hinges on whether the American people “see and understand that they’re being put at risk” – and vote accordingly. 
Republican state leaders have expressed at least tepid support for the cuts, though one said he was uneasy about the pace.
After the first round in February, Gov. Brian Kemp said “government can stand a little right-sizing.” Suwanee Republican U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick said he asked the White House to slow the pace of the firings after being caught in the crosshairs of an angry town hall, telling the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in February that “I think we’re just moving a little too fast.” Congressman Mike Collins, a Jackson Republican, told WABE in February that the fired workers could go find other work in Georgia. 
Boim, who was fired in February, said she is trying to find another job, broadening the search to even “health adjacent” roles. 
“I have applied to 127 jobs,” she said. “I keep a spreadsheet. I’ve had two canceled interviews, both because they’re worried about federal funding, and a lot of thanks, but no thanks, because the job market is just saturated with people like me.” 
She said she hopes the state’s Republican leaders will come around.
“I think they’re scared. If you’re not on Trump’s side, you’re against him, and I think that they’re scared of getting on his bad side,” Boim said. “I’m sorry, but people need to start being brave. I feel like CDC is a bipartisan issue. Everybody knows that you need CDC.” 
‘Not going quietly’
Jill Daugherty said she knew the CDC’s injury center she worked at was likely poised to lose staffers, but the extent of the cuts left her stunned. The injury center was gutted after last month’s round of cuts, with Daugherty’s traumatic brain injury team wiped out. She thinks the goal is to dismantle the CDC.
“We really didn’t know which teams were going to get cut, so we were just kind of waiting around the whole week before, like, ‘Is it gonna be us? Is it gonna be us?’ And then it was everybody,” Daugherty said.
That’s how Daugherty found herself on the other side of the CDC’s entrance on a recent Tuesday afternoon holding a sign that said, “Firing experts… Ignoring science… CDC deserves better.” She stood on the curb as the passing vehicles – including her former colleagues leaving work for the day – honked their horns at the group of demonstrators.

The Tuesday rallies, organized by retired CDC staffers, have become a ritual since the mass firings started. 
“You’re not just standing up for yourselves. You’re standing up for our country and the best that America represents,” U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, told fired CDC workers during a visit to one of the rallies in April.
Even when facing the prospect of unemployment and an uncertain future, many of the fired CDC workers still focus on the loss to the programs they had dedicated their careers to advancing when they talk about the mass firings.
Aryn Backus was a health communication specialist at the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health until Valentine’s Day, when hundreds of workers were swept up in the first round of dismissals. She said she remained hopeful that the firing would be reversed until her entire office was cut in April. 
“So, I knew that even if I were to get my termination rescinded, there would be no job to go back to,” said Backus, who is the mother of a 1-year-old.
But even then, when standing at a microphone in front of reporters recently, Backus wanted to talk about the work her office did to curb smoking rates – and all the work left to do.
“The impact of these CDC cuts will be felt in public health for years to come. They’re not going to help make America healthy but will decrease public health programs that help save lives,” said Backus, who is also part of Fired But Fighting.
“That’s why the CDC employees are not going quietly. We are fighting back to not only protect civil service, but to protect public health.”

(Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)President Donald Trump Thursday congratulated more than 200 graduates at a commencement ceremony at the University of Alabama for their academic accomplishments, and himself for his first 100 days in office for his second term.
In a meandering, hour-long address that drew a nearby protest, Trump called Alabama a “winner” and urged graduates to lead successful lives.
“Today, I am also asking you to look forward to, really, something very, very bright, more promising,” Trump said. “And it is going to be even more promising tomorrow, I promise you that. You are the first graduating class of the golden age of America.”
The president also praised himself for his controversial executive orders and rehashed his grievances with his critics and the Biden administration.
“In a matter of weeks, we achieved the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded,” Trump said to the applause of the crowd. “We have seen hundreds of thousands of people pouring into our country from prisons, from mental institutions, gangs, and all over the world, not just in South America.”
According to Axios, the decline in border crossings began under the Biden administration and was due in part to actions taken by the government of Mexico. Experts also say that border crossings can fluctuate. Trump’s actions have also led to the wrongful arrest of several people with legal status, including Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia and three U.S. citizen children under the age of 10, including one with Stage 4 cancer.
Much of the evening’s speech focused on imparting words of wisdom for the graduates using a list of virtues they should incorporate into their lives.

“In America, with drive and ambition, young people can do anything,” Trump said. The president, who became president of a real estate company his father Fred built, spoke about how he developed a property in Manhattan when he was in his 20s. Trump then praised Steve Jobs and Walt Disney for their accomplishments founding companies.
“If you are going to do something, you might as well think big because it is just as tough,” he said. “I know a lot of people, they thought small, and they are very smart. I know others who were not very smart, but they thought about the big picture.”
Throughout the address, Trump would shift quickly from advice to graduates to monologues on social issues. He repeatedly raised transgender issues, returning multiple times to what he characterized as the problem of males who transitioned into females and playing on female sports teams.
He would end his speech by heaping praise on Alabama for more than five minutes.
“You continue the legacy of Alabama legends who blazed the trails, won the games, tilled the fields, forged the steels, built the ships, and gave us the victories that built the American and changed the world.”
He praised the car racing in Talladega and highlighted the rockets developed in the state.
“This is the state that gave us nothing but victory,” Trump said. “The state with some of the greatest heroes in history, like Willie Mays, Jesse Owens, Joe Louis, your coach Nick Saban.”

A protest of Trump’s appearance organized by the University of Alabama’s College Democrats drew over 100 people.
“We deserve somebody who works for the people, by the people. And right now we have someone who is working for billionaires, by billionaires,” said Kyla Chatmon, a junior political science and African American studies double major at The University of Alabama. “And I think that is just unjust. And so I came out today to show my support to all the graduates who are having to have their graduation overshadowed by an authoritarian, fascist, dictator.”
Mary Maxwell, who also attended the event, said she feels like the university might have been scared to say no to the sitting president.
“It is a red state and people are afraid of him,” she said. “They’re afraid he’ll cut their funding and he’ll try to control what’s being taught at the school. I taught at the university for 20 years and did research for 15 [years]. He’s against education. He’s against science. He’s against people knowing more than him.”
Former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama and Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who ran for governor and U.S. Senator in Texas, spoke at the event.
“He wants us to feel hopeless. He wants us to feel like he has all the power. And let me tell you something. In this country, in this great democracy, in this government of, by and for the people, the real power is with us,” O’Rourke said during his speech.
O’Rourke encouraged protest attendees to keep fighting against the administration’s policies during his speech as well, invoking Bloody Tuesday, an attack on civil rights protestors by police and a white mob in Tuscaloosa in 1964, and Bloody Sunday, an attack on civil rights protestors crossing Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965.
“We can overcome these challenges, because we have overcome them before against much greater odds,” he said to the crowd.
Former Senator Doug Jones said during his speech that the gathering was “not a protest, this is a movement.”
“It is movements that changed this country,” he said. “Whether it was the Civil Rights Movement, whether it was the Anti-War movement, it is the movements. And guess what? It started on college campuses.”

Jones also encouraged protest participants to write to their U.S. Senators as a form of speaking up and out for what they want.
“Write your U.S. Senators, they’ll ignore it, but write them anyway! Because those things mean something. As someone who sat in the halls of the United States Senate, we tried to answer everything, even people that came in that opposed what we were doing,” Jones said.
Jones also encouraged attendees to get involved with civic engagement to fight for the change they would like to see.
“Go to your county commission, go to your city council offices. Get engaged, civic engagement at the local level is where we have to be, that’s the power. You have that power,” he said.

With nighttime temperatures frequently still in the 30s, impossibly long waiting lists for shelter beds, and already limited housing options which precluded us from accessing them because of our relationship status, health conditions and pets, we had a resounding question to ask. Where then shall we go?
Through the 2025 People’s Budget, Unhoused Activists Community Team members have called on the Elicker administration and local Board of Alders to fully fund the overnight warming and cooling centers throughout the year until a long term, humane and dignified solution can be adopted to ensure everyone who wants to can be sheltered in New Haven.
We are your neighbors, friends, and family. We serve your coffee, cook your food, care for your houses, repair your cars, and contribute to this city in a variety of ways, but affordability has excluded us from accessing traditional homes like you.
The mayor’s logic is filled with more potholes than the ones he’s left in the streets of New Haven. Even as he shutters the warming centers, if we set up tents and tarps in discrete locations to better protect ourselves and our few belongings, law enforcement officials are rapidly deployed to sweep and seize what little we have. Should we be harassed and criminalized simply because we are unsheltered?
Neighbors like you can help by ensuring civic solution systems like “See, Click, Fix” and Call211 are used to report downed stop signs and broken street lamps not our critical camp sites and temporarily unattended carts stationed next to park benches. Better yet, flood the mayor’s phone and email with demands for more publicly accessible storage and bathrooms! 
With these vital emergency resources cut off, hundreds of us have no where else to go. When warming centers are shut down, they don’t just turn off the heat—they turn away human beings and sentence us to uncertainty, instability, and peril.
While a President in Washington D.C. and a mayor in New Haven might endorse extrajudicial policies which attempt to disappear people they find personally and politically abhorrent, we believe the real residents of this city and state stand for more and pride ourselves on values of inclusion, community solidarity, mutuality, and economic justice.
Many of our state representatives agree and are fighting to pass legislation like House Bill 7033, an initiative Justin Elicker has testified against, which would decriminalize homelessness and necessary life-sustaining activities like seeking temporary refuge in an unobtrusive way on public lands.
Show your support and tell your politicians that you believe in humane policies, like HB 7033, which make our communities safer for all of our neighbors.
It’s time for community driven solutions to this collective housing crisis. We need to start by keeping the warming centers open year-round, constructing publicly available bathrooms in highly accessible areas, and decriminalizing our right to peacefully exist and seek refuge outside when no other options are available to us. Until that happens, we’re not solving homelessness—we’re just hiding it.
Just as the need for shelter doesn’t change with the temperature and the rain and wind don’t yield because the calendar says it’s spring, the struggle of being unhoused doesn’t stop just because the mayor and his budget say it should.
The time for common sense, compassion, and solidarity is not seasonal. It’s always, and it’s now. The emergency is tonight.

Ryan Fazio, Greenwich First Selectman Fred Camillo and Selectwoman Lauren Rabin. I asked if they were going to speak out against Trump’s destruction of our democracy, his lawlessness and his attacks on human dignity. None of the them responded. As far as I can tell, none of them have publicly denounced the president’s actions.

Jonathan Perloe
The German pastor and anti-Nazi dissident Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, “Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.” He was sentenced to death and executed in a concentration camp for his resistance to Hitler’s fascist regime.
My Republican elected officials’ silence speaks volumes. As leaders in the President’s party, their voices have influence that Democrats simply can’t match, and not for want of trying. Given the stakes at hand, their silence makes them complicit in the unprecedented attacks on our constitutional democracy being carried out daily by President Trump and his administration.
 It makes them complicit in Trump’s incoherent trade war that is increasingly likely to lead to a global recession, cost American jobs and perhaps most alarmingly, undermine the U.S. dollar as the world’s most stable currency which will dramatically raise the cost of financing our nation’s debt.
They are complicit in seriously compromising our self-defense, saying nothing about the gross incompetence of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and other senior national security officials who used an unsecure, commercial messaging platform to unknowingly share military strike plans with a journalist. Nor saying anything about substantially degrading the country’s cyberdefenses, including substantial portions of the systems that protect elections from cyberattacks and provide early warning of attacks on the power grid, communications and pipelines.
Fazio, Camillo and Rabin are complicit in wrongly deporting without notice, legal justification or due process, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a legal immigrant who posed no threat. They are complicit in creating a constitutional crisis now that the Trump administration has willfully ignored the Supreme Court’s ruling to return him from the notorious Salvadoran prison that a federal judge called one of the most “inhumane and dangerous prisons in the world,” exposing him to harm that “shocks the conscience.”
They are complicit in supporting a president who has said he has no problem deporting U.S. citizens, who has declared himself king and who incited an insurrection to keep himself in power despite losing the 2020 election.
They are complicit in Trump’s sweeping attack on voting that could disenfranchise millions of eligible voters, especially women, by requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. Trump’s baseless claims about noncitizen voting reveal his true intentions to undermine free and fair elections that are the foundation of our representative democracy. Voting by noncitizens is virtually nonexistent and already illegal, with penalties including prison time and deportation. A study by the Brennan Center for Justice found only 30 suspected incidents of potential noncitizen voting out of 24 million votes cast in the 2016 presidential election.
Rather than actually encouraging the rigorous analysis needed to reduce government waste, with their silence these three Republican officials are complicit in Trump’s corrupt crony capitalism aimed at further enriching his billionaire friends. Trump delayed a Biden administration effort to close a loophole that has resulted in Medicare spending more than $10 billion annually on unproven “skin substitute” bandages, more than it spends on ambulance rides, anesthesia or CT scans. Trump received a large campaign contribution from one of the bandage sellers.
With their silence, Fazio, Camillo and Rabin are complicit in Trump’s war on the rule of law, which J Michael Luttig, a conservative former federal judge, characterized as a “full-frontal assault on the constitution, the rule of law, the federal judiciary, the American justice system and the nation’s legal profession.”
Because they chose not to respond to my email, I can’t say whether Fazio, Camillo and  Rabin (along with the vast majority of GOP officials nationwide) agree with Trump’s lawless, corrupt and inhumane agenda, don’t have the courage and integrity to stand up to him or don’t want to risk losing their power for the good of the American people.
Regardless of their motivations, the silence of Republican elected officials is putting the economic security, health and safety of Americans, and our democracy at grave risk. Perhaps with enough encouragement from their constituents, they’ll do the right thing and stand up to President Trump.

Is that fair? We say no.,"A part-time faculty member teaches class with strep throat. Another part-time faculty member teaches classes remotely from his hospital bed. Still another part-time faculty member resumes teaching on campus two weeks after giving birth. 
These are just a few examples of the real-life consequences when part-time instructors in the Connecticut State Colleges and University system don’t get sick days. Is that fair? We say no.
Let’s start with the idea that anyone with a student-facing job in the CSCU system deserves a minimum level of support.  After all, the Connecticut state universities are all about the success of our students and the sustainability of the system.  Then the long-term well-being of the system depends upon the well-being of the employees who provide direct services to the students.  Surely these employees are provided with the resources they need, right?  The case is not so clear for the part-time faculty in the CSU system.
According to the National Center for Educational Statistics College Navigator (Fall 2023 numbers), 57.16% (1,552) of the 2,715 instructional faculty in the CSCUs are part-time, and contingent.  Part-time faculty are not continuing employees.  We are hired only for one academic semester at a time, with no guarantee of being rehired in the future. 
Years, and in some cases, decades of service matter little, because we provide flexibility to the system.  We make far less money and enjoy far fewer benefits than our full-time colleagues.  We provide substantial cost savings to the system.  An example of these benefits is paid sick time.  Part-time faculty do not receive paid sick time.  That benefit is only available to full-time faculty.  
Here is the problem.  Like every other CSCU employee, part-time faculty do occasionally get sick or injured. Part-time faculty have immediate family members die.  We also must sometimes care for a seriously sick or injured family member.  But, among the professional employees in the CSCUs, part-time faculty alone are required to take unpaid leave for these reasons.  
Add to this the fact that most part-time faculty are not eligible for health insurance through their employment in the CSCUs.  Why is the part-time majority of the CSU faculty treated like this?
This inequity is even worse during times of crisis.  During the COVID pandemic, enrollments in the CSCU system dropped significantly.  Those enrollments are now recovering quite nicely, but the situation would have been worse if the CSCUs had not offered some on-ground instruction during the pandemic.  
With a very few exceptions, full-time faculty got to choose whether they taught on-ground or not.  Part-time faculty were not so fortunate.  Many of us, myself included, were offered courses to teach only if they were partly or entirely on-ground.  If we were unwilling or unable to teach in-person, the courses would be taught by someone else.  As a result, these courses were disproportionately taught by the part-time faculty, who had neither paid sick leave nor health insurance.  Full-time faculty, who had both, could choose to stay remote.
I hope you remember what things were like during the COVID pandemic.  Being on-ground on a college campus entailed a substantive risk of contracting a disease about which little was known.  Many Connecticut residents got quite sick, and some died.  Isn’t it interesting that the group of faculty without sick time or health insurance were asked to assume most of this risk?  What happened to part-time faculty who got COVID, particularly long COVID?  They were at serious risk of losing their courses in the CSUs.
Another wrinkle is that over 600 part-time faculty in the CSCUs lost their courses during the pandemic.  This was due not only to COVID-related issues, but also to the decreased enrollments that resulted.  If you have never heard that statistic, don’t be surprised.  Faculty did lose their jobs, but those losses happened among the group that was asked to assume most of the risk of working on-ground, with no sick leave or health insurance.
So, if you are wondering why part-time faculty should have paid sick leave, the answer is fairly straightforward.  The CSCU system already saves a substantial amount of money by excluding most of us from obtaining health insurance through our employment.  It then asks us to assume the same risk, or more risk as during the pandemic, of getting sick because of doing our jobs.  The result is a longstanding inequity for the majority of the CSCU faculty.  
If we believe that the sustainability of the Connecticut state university system is a good idea, we need to look to the well-being of the students and the employees.  It is time to support the majority of the CSCU faculty, the part-timers.  One simple and relatively inexpensive way to do this is to allow part-time faculty to earn and use sick time.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)To avoid high insurance costs, some groups of commercial fishers in Alaska have formed cooperatives to collectively pay liability and damage claims themselves.
A bill passed April 25 by the Alaska House of Representatives would exempt these cooperatives from regulation under the state’s insurance laws.
The House voted 37-0 to pass House Bill 116, which now goes to the Senate for consideration.
The bill was carried on the House floor by Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, but came from the ideas of a legislative task force assigned to study the commercial fishing industry, she told the House.
The three insurance cooperatives already operating in the state are organized under Washington state law, she said, and cover about 840 vessels. The legal change would allow Alaska fishers to organize other pools locally.
“This bill comes at no cost to the state and supports our fishing industry by simply allowing Alaska-based commercial fishing insurance cooperatives to form,” she said. “Rising premiums and availability of insurance serve as a barrier to operating for Alaska’s aging commercial fishing fleet. Underwriters have been raising premiums on individual vessels and have become increasingly selective of which vessels they choose to ensure.”
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, said that insurance is now required in order to enter Homer’s small boat harbor, and she’s heard from fishers in other communities who now wonder whether they can afford to fish.
“I think this is a wonderful opportunity to allow a free market,” she said. “They take the risk, but it just says, hey, we want to no longer restrict you if this is something that you want to take on and be able to form a group for yourself.”

(Photo courtesy of Idaho State University)Now more than ever, leadership comes down to knowing when and how to pivot.
Whether you’re running a small business, managing a classroom, serving in public office or raising a family, you’ve likely seen firsthand how quickly circumstances can change. At Idaho State University, we feel it too. But rather than retreat in the face of uncertainty, or freeze in place, we’re leaning in with courage, creativity and a deep sense of responsibility to the state of Idaho and its communities.
Nowhere is that more evident than in ISU’s L.S. Skaggs College of Pharmacy, serving Idaho for over 100 years.
Like many professional programs nationwide, market pressures in the pharmacy industry have caused enrollment declines over the past decade. For a state like Idaho, where access to health care is already strained, this is a serious concern.
Many pharmacy programs in the U.S. have tried to just weather the storm, unwilling to respond or adapt. At ISU, forward-thinking administrators and faculty got to work. They asked hard questions, made tough decisions and reimagined what the future could look like. They pivoted.
For the College of Pharmacy, their strategy in the face of enrollment changes was both simple and bold: tighten the belt, focus on excellence and stay true to our mission. The college began a multi-year “step-down” budget process to right-size operations while protecting core programs and positions. They eliminated vacancies through attrition, restructured contracts and found smart ways to reduce overhead and adjust student cohort sizes. Every decision was guided by a commitment to students, principles and patients, not bureaucracy or maintaining the status quo.
And it’s working. Through disciplined planning, ISU’s College of Pharmacy is not only financially stable, but it’s innovating and thriving in a new environment while continuing to graduate skilled professionals.
Take, for example, their expansion of clinical psychopharmacology. This master’s degree program trains licensed psychologists to prescribe medication safely and effectively, especially in underserved areas. Today, we have 22 students enrolled from across the country, and demand continues to grow. That’s a real impact, rooted in local need and national relevance.
Or look at our hybrid delivery model. With campuses in Pocatello, Meridian and Anchorage, Alaska, in partnership with the University of Alaska Anchorage, our faculty teach and collaborate across thousands of miles, supporting students in rural communities and building tight-knit teams that defy geographic boundaries. They’ve turned a challenge into a strength.
What we’ve learned from ISU’s College of Pharmacy applies far beyond higher education. When circumstances shift, we can’t cling to the way things used to be. We need leaders at every level who are willing to adapt, focus on purpose and move forward with faith in the future. It also requires confidence in the mission and knowing what not to sacrifice or give up in pursuit of making a positive difference.
At Idaho State University, our purpose is clear. We exist to serve Idaho. We prepare the next generation of pharmacists, nurses, teachers, engineers and business leaders while contributing to the creative arts and producing impactful research. We provide a return on investment that benefits every community, and we do this with fewer resources than most universities of our size.
This year, as Idahoans consider the future of education and government, I hope our story adds something meaningful to the conversation. Higher education institutions can adapt; we can pivot while being true to the most important aspects of an educational mission. At our best, we are nimble, practical and deeply committed to solving real problems and contributing to society.
We’re not perfect. But we’re listening. We’re learning. And we’re leading.
In uncertain times, leadership isn’t about being the loudest voice in the room. It’s about showing up, making hard, but principled decisions, and exhibiting strength through resiliency. Because perseverance in tough times doesn’t just steady the ship, it charts a better, bolder course for the future.

A crowd of hundreds sprawled across the lawn of the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Thursday and rallied and marched through downtown Denver in a May Day protest organized by left-wing groups. They returned for an immigration-focused event on the Capitol steps.
“May Day is a historic day, not just for us, but for workers all around the world,” said Yoselin Corrales of Aurora Unidos CSO, the grassroots group that helped organize the rally. “We must take the lessons from our history and keep the fight alive. In our country today, workers rights and immigrants are actively being attacked from all directions.”

The city of Aurora found itself in the national spotlight last year when Trump, campaigning on a platform of mass deportations and harsh new border restrictions, claimed the expansive suburb of 400,000 had been “invaded and conquered” by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Early in his second term, Trump’s claims about the gang have fueled one of the most controversial elements of his agenda: The invocation of the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act to deport 137 detainees to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador in March.
About 90% of those 137 deportees had no criminal record, and at least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error.” Advocates, attorneys and family members for other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team. The administration has moved to designate hundreds of other detainees for similar removals, but a variety of federal courts have halted the practice citing due process concerns and the inapplicability of the Alien Enemies Act in peacetime. Trump has openly floated plans to send American citizens to the prison, known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, next.
A series of highly publicized raids in Denver and Aurora in February by Immigration and Customs Enforcement failed to turn up a large TdA presence in the area, with agency officials telling Fox News that they had detained just one suspected gang member out of the hundred they had targeted. Instead, federal law enforcement agents have touted busts of at least two underground nightclubs, where they said they detained dozens of people in the country unlawfully. ICE agents also detained Jeanette Vizguerra, a prominent local immigration rights activist, in a March arrest that Vizguerra’s lawyers allege was an act of retaliation for her speech.

Corrales urged the crowd at the Capitol to stand up for Vizguerra and other “working women who are detained at the horrific ICE concentration camp in Aurora for the simple crime of crossing borders while poor.”
ICE operates an immigration detention center in Aurora.
Citing the additional burdens and barriers faced by immigrants in the workforce, including employers’ use of the threat of ICE enforcement to coerce immigrants into unfair working conditions, she said the fight for immigrants’ rights and workers’ rights are part of an interconnected struggle.
“We are here today because we are here to fight, not on one front, or even two or three fronts,” Corrales said. “We’re going to stand with workers on every front.”
Ramon Zuniga, secretary-treasurer of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 and the son of Mexican immigrants, echoed that message.
“Immigrant rights are workers’ rights, and unions will lead the charge to fight back and stand up in solidarity with our immigrant brothers and sisters,” Zuniga said. “We must take to the streets, and to the Capitol and courtrooms, and to the ballot box, and together, we will prevail.”
The protest follows several other recent Trump-agenda protests at the Capitol, the latest on April 19.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Several thousand people took to New Mexico streets Thursday evening, in marches and community gatherings — complete with paletas and protest signs — in celebration of workers, expressing solidarity with immigrants and others targeted by the Trump Administration.
“We’re not going to let them destroy our workforce, we’re going to protect our kids, and we are going to show them that we are here to stay,” said Fabiola Landeros, community organizer on immigration for El Centro, repeating herself in Spanish to the crowd. Both events in Santa Fe and Albuquerque were bilingual.
Approximately 100 people gathered outside the St. Bede’s Episcopal Church in Santa Fe on Thursday evening to rally against U.S. President Donald Trump’s mass deportations and disappearances and celebrate the immigrant workers’ rights movement in New Mexico.
Another couple thousand people marched in the streets of Albuquerque after a rally at Tiguex Park, stretching the full length of a city block. 
Thursday was International Workers Day, also known as May Day, a holiday directly born from the fight for workers’ rights in the U.S. sparked by the demand for the eight-hour workday. The U.S. has long refused to officially recognize the holiday, but rallies, demonstrations and protests took place across the country as part of a national day of action, including in several additional New Mexico locales.
The gathering in Tiguex opened on a somber note, with neighbors of Nhon Ngoc Nguyen, a 58-year old Vietnamese national who died in ICE custody on April 16, speaking out, holding signs with his photo. Nguyen, who had dementia, was detained during a Feb. 24 appointment with ICE in Albuquerque.
A statement from his nephew, Duke Nguyen, was read out, memorializing his uncle’s love of soccer and his affection for his nieces, who remained in Vietnam. 
“With this, I say we remember Nhon as someone who will be deeply missed, but never forgotten — for the person he was and the impact he had on those around him,” the statement concluded.

Megan Taros, environmental justice and community development coordinator at the nonprofit Earth Care and the child of a Mexican immigrant, said while the Trump administration is targeting immigrants, no one is safe under fascism. “While our pride in our communities is a risk, and fighting back is a risk, looking away will not save you,” said Taros, who has previously contributed to Source NM. “We demand not only that MAGA Republicans end this assault on our communities, but also that our Democratic leadership act in a manner that reflects the severity of this moment. Beyond the political binary, we must demand a radical change in the system that values profit over people, which depends on caging and subjugating specific groups.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Amid a severe state budget deficit, the Alaska Senate Finance Committee is proposing the lowest Permanent Fund dividend in five years and — if adjusted for inflation — the lowest dividend ever.
On Thursday, the committee unveiled a new version of its proposed state operating budget with a $1,000 dividend, a $400 reduction from its first draft. 
That cut reduces the Senate’s budget draft by $265 million, likely balancing it once additional legislation is considered.
The dividend figure is not final: The committee will consider budget amendments on Friday, and the full Senate will vote on the committee’s proposal next week.
If the Senate adopts the $1,000 figure, it would have to be negotiated with the House, which approved a $1,400 dividend in April.
The House’s budget contained a significant deficit, however, and differing policy positions between the House and Senate have left lawmakers with no choice but to cut services and the dividend in order to balance the budget.
The document unveiled Thursday is the committee’s second draft operating budget, and it follows prior drafts from both the House and Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
The new Senate committee draft is $1.7 billion less than the governor’s proposed operating budget and $384 million below the draft approved by the House.
In both cases, the primary difference is the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend.
Dunleavy proposed a dividend of roughly $3,900 per recipient based on the formula in state law, which would have resulted in a $2.1 billion deficit. 
He proposed solving that deficit by taking the money from the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state’s chief savings account. That account contains $2.8 billion, and members of the Senate have refused to spend from the CBR for the coming fiscal year, citing the prospect of larger deficits next year.

In Portland, a march organized by a coalition of unions, community and leftist political groups briefly stopped traffic on Forest Ave. as the crowd progressed from the University of Southern Maine through the city, culminating with a crowd of roughly 1,000 in Congress Square.
Scott Adams, president of the American Postal Workers Union Local 458, addressed those gathered outside the post office. He said that President Donald Trump and billionaire advisor Elon Musk want to privatize the U.S. Postal Service.
 “We will lose everything we won in the past if we don’t fight in the present,” he said.
Other speakers highlighted local labor fights. Stephen Bennett of the University of Maine Graduate Workers Union pointed out that they’d been negotiating their first contracts for more than 500 days. 
“Why does the University of Maine System refuse to acknowledge that our work is valuable?” Bennett asked.

The graduate workers and their supporters, including the Maine Education Association and Eastern Maine Labor Council, also held a march and rally in Orono. Other events were organized in Bridgeton, Bath, Augusta, Waterville, Auburn and York.
On Wednesday, national AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler participated in a listening session with Maine workers that have been impacted by the actions of the Trump administration, including a recent executive order that ended collective bargaining rights for federal unions.

Union Migrante, an immigrant advocacy group, organized the event that started with several speeches, delivered in the shadow of a monument to Benito Juarez, the first indigenous president of Mexico. The rally concluded with participants marching to and from City Hall.
President Donald Trump and his push for mass deportations were a focal point of the event, which also included pro-Palestinian speakers and members of a newly formed nurses union at University Medical Center. Earlier in the day, the nurses went on strike to demand better pay and working conditions from UMC’s management organization, LCMC Health.
In addition to Trump, speakers took and at billionaire Elon Musk, an unofficial adviser to the president who’s led the call for drastic federal government job cuts. Gov. Jeff Landry was also called out for his alignment with Trump.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Two major roadblocks remain before Iowa lawmakers can pass the state’s budget and end the 2025 legislative session — pipelines and paraeducator pay, among a few other spending priorities.
Iowa lawmakers will not receive most session per-diem payments after Friday — a milestone meant to spur legislators to approve budget bills and end the session. While Republicans hold a trifecta of control at the Statehouse, there are still disagreements between the two chambers on funding and policy proposals. One of the major pieces of policy that remains up for discussion is the use of eminent domain in carbon sequestration pipeline projects.
On Wednesday, a group of 12 GOP senators sent a letter to Senate leadership demanding debate on House File 639, legislation passed by the House and approved through the Senate committee process.
“We believe addressing eminent domain is more important than the budget or any other priority for the 2025 session and pledge to vote against any remaining budget bill until a floor vote occurs on the clean HF639 bill,” the letter states.
Bills need a constitutional majority, at least 26 votes, in order to pass the Senate. If the 12 Republican senators who signed the letter and all 16 Democrats vote against a bill, the measure will fail.
The lawmakers who signed onto the letter were Sens. Kevin Alons, Doug Campbell, Rocky De Witt, Lynn Evans, Dennis Guth, Mark Lofgren, Mike Pike, Dave Rowley, Sandy Salmon, Dave Sires, Jeff Taylor and Cherielynn Westrich. These senators and others have spoken on the Senate floor about the need to pass a bill on eminent domain and pipelines during “points of personal privilege” following debate in the past two weeks.
Sen. David Rowley, R-Spirit Lake, said Senate discussion on the use of eminent domain in pipeline projects has “been a long time coming” as Senate discussions on similar measures have failed to advance for the past three years.
“We had a lot of pushback over the years and and we felt this year, it was getting strung out as well, so we took this measure to do everything we can to bring it to the floor,” Rowley said.
The measures brought up in 2025 and during previous legislative sessions largely focus on the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would span more than 1,000 miles in Iowa transporting liquid carbon dioxide from ethanol plants to underground storage facilities in North Dakota.  Rowley said he has had many discussions with landowners who would be affected by the Summit project, many of whom are concerned about the potential health risks posed by a CO2 pipeline on their property.
“It’s horrible to think that the government could come in and force them to have that pipeline on their property,” Rowley said. “And even though Summit’s done a great job I think, working with people or trying to, it’s still — it’s not enough. It can’t be enough.”
The bill brought up in the letter is a measure the House advanced in March to prohibit carbon sequestration pipelines from using eminent domain in Iowa. Floor debate at the time included concerns over the Senate’s avoidance of eminent domain bills over the past several years.
The proposal combines a number of bills previously proposed in the House aimed at hindering the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. The bill would increase insurance requirements for pipeline operators, limit permits to one 25-year term and adjust the definition of a common carrier that would eligible for eminent domain. The bill also requires a member of the Iowa Utilities Commission be present at all hearings, limits the commission’s ability to impose sanctions on Iowans who intervene in the proceedings and allows affected Iowans, including lawmakers, to intervene.
Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, proposed a major amendment to the bill that would remove the eminent domain ban and broaden the scope of the bill to include all eminent domain projects in the state — such as roads or utility lines — not just liquid hazardous pipelines. The amendment, which can only be officially adopted on the floor, would allow projects to find voluntary easements outside of the original project corridor, which Bousselot said during committee hearings would allow projects to “avoid” eminent domain.
His amendment would also require an IUC decision on a permit within one year and strikes almost all of the House language, keeping only the IUC attendance requirements and portions of the insurance requirements.
Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, proposed a strikethrough amendment to Bousselot’s proposition. Another amendment, proposed by a group of largely the same GOP lawmakers who signed onto the letter, would limit the definition of public use projects in Iowa Code related to eminent domain for the construction of “hazardous liquid pipelines for the transportation or transmission of liquefied carbon dioxide.”
Salmon, R-Janesville, said in an interview with the Iowa Capital Dispatch the letter was sent as public pressure has been building for Iowa lawmakers to take action on this issue.
“By and large, the public has become quite aware of it now, and and really don’t see the need for eminent domain to be used for this project,” Salmon said. “It’s a private project. It’s for private use. It’s not a public use project, and our Constitution requires it be a public use in order to have eminent domain used.”
The fact that South Dakota now has a law banning the use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipeline has also helped “build the momentum to put the same type of prohibitions on CO2 pipelines here in Iowa,” Salmon said.
Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver said in a statement that “a number of Republican Senators are working on policy surrounding eminent domain and pipeline issues and I am optimistic we will find a legislative solution.”
Disputes over spending between House, Senate and governor remain
The senators’ plan to block legislation from moving unless eminent domain legislation comes to the floor is not the only item keeping lawmakers from advancing budget bills.
On Monday, the governor and Senate Republicans said in a news release they had reached a “budget compromise.” The same day, House Republicans released their own targets for the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget.
In the following days, appropriations subcommittees and committees passed budget bills. But as of Thursday, the chambers have not reached resolutions on the line items that remain a conflict between the two chambers. House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, asked lawmakers on the Appropriations Committee Thursday to “stand ready” for future meetings, but did not lay out a timeline for when the committee will advance the remaining budget bills.
The difference between the two budget targets comes down to $36 million, a relatively small amount when comparing the$9.453 billion in the House proposal and $9.417 billion in the agreement reached between Gov. Kim Reynolds and Senate Republicans. However, Reynolds said in an interview on the WHO AM Simon Conway show this amount was still important during a time when the state needs to be “fiscally responsible,” as it faces lower revenue from income tax cuts and federal financial uncertainty.
“Somebody said, ‘Well, it’s not that much money, it’s only $36 million difference between the two,’ — well, it is a lot of money,” Reynolds said in the interview. “Ask Iowans how much money that is. And every time, it’s that kind of mentality, it’s that kind of thought process that grows government and gets you in trouble in the first place.”
But House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters Thursday the differences between the two budgets largely entail spending for which House Republicans will have trouble compromising.
One of the largest pieces, $14 million, provides continued funding to raise the pay for paraeducators and other school staff. The measure was first approved in a 2024 law that also made changes to Iowa’s Area Education Agencies. Grassley said this spending was included in Reynolds’ original budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 and then removed in negotiations with the Senate.
“At no point did we think that that wasn’t going to be something that we were going to be able to fund,” Grassley said. “And I will be honest with you, that’s one of the pieces right now that I would say is one of the biggest sticking points. Our caucus feels extremely strongly that if we’re going to provide that level of support that we did with that bill last year, that we’re not going to go back and just cut that, and leave our schools in a situation to find the difference.”
Reynolds said Thursday in an interview with Radio Iowa that “nothing was mentioned about the $14 million” in earlier negotiations on education spending related to the State Supplemental Aid package passed in early April.
Other spending components in House Republicans’ package that differ between the two chambers are an $8 million bump for community colleges compared to the Senate proposal, and a $9 million difference in funding for certain nursing facility reimbursement rates.
Grassley said it is not out of the ordinary for the governor and Senate Republicans to be in closer alignment on budget goals than House Republicans.
“With 67 members representing every county across the state, we try to have a very open situation when it comes to our budget, take as much feedback and fund those priorities. And again, our goal is when we leave here (that) we fund the commitments that we’ve made to Iowans, as well as make strategic investments.”

Among them: spending more time with his family and the dysfunction in his own GOP, which he said is wearing on him.","U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., prepares for a debate for Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District against State Sen. Tony Vargas, a Democrat, on Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2024, in Lincoln. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — On the same day Densie Powell announced she is running in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb, said Nebraska Democrats had learned nothing. 
“They keep running extraordinarily left-wing candidates in Omaha,” Bacon told the Nebraska Examiner. “If you want to win in Nebraska [2nd District], you’ve got to run a more centrist candidate.”
Bacon also reaffirmed his summer timeline for deciding to run or not, saying he will decide “thoughtfully.” He spoke during a monthly news conference with reporters about the reasons he is considering retiring from Congress. Among them: spending more time with his family and the dysfunction in his own GOP, which he said is wearing on him.
“It’s one thing to fight the other party, but when you have fights in your own party, the enjoyment factor is not the same,” Bacon said. “It’s become a blood sport.”
Former 2022 GOP gubernatorial candidate Brett Lindstrom has told people in political circles that he might be interested in a bid if Bacon retires. Another conservative being discussed is Dan Frei, who ran against Bacon in the 2024 GOP primary.  
Denise Powell launches bid in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District

Bacon, who beat the last Democrat to hold a congressional seat in Nebraska in 2016, U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, compared the first major announced 2nd District candidate, Powell, to former State Sen. Tony Vargas, who twice failed to unseat Bacon.  

Powell recently announced endorsements from Omaha’s State Sens. Margo Juarez and Dunixi Guereca and other elected officials in the district. Powell declined to respond to Bacon’s comments.
Powell, in an interview Wednesday, told the Examiner she wants to give the district an “everyday working” voice in D.C. She said she hopes for a political moment when voters are done with partisanship, as people are “frustrated by our elected officials who were supposed to represent us.”
Powell has criticized Bacon for “taking votes in DC that are hurting Nebraskans,” and said she would prioritize protecting Medicaid and Social Security and would, among other things, vote to ensure the federal government does its part to boost quality K-12 education. 
Bacon said State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha has a voting record that outside political groups would easily use to highlight his “left-wing votes.”  
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon considers retirement, a Nebraska lawmaker interested in running for his seat

Cavanaugh publicly acknowledged in recent days that he is exploring a bid and said he would decide by the end of the session. He accused Bacon of using DC-style politics to “muddy the waters” before he even announces a potential bid.   
“While Congressman Bacon has continued to support policies that are making it harder for Nebraskans to afford things like eggs, diapers, and other day-to-day expenses,” Cavanaugh told the Examiner. “I have cut taxes on diapers, stopped a sales tax increase on food, and protected access to reproductive healthcare.”
The National Republican Congressional Committee also released a statement on Powell’s announcement, criticizing her and “any other extreme Democrat” as “another out-of-touch liberal pushing a radical agenda that puts woke ideology ahead of Nebraskans.” 
“Next year, Nebraskans will reject Powell, or any other extreme Democrat,” said Zach Bannon, an NRCC spokesperson.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Some 120 South Carolinians who oppose the Trump administration lined the sidewalks of Columbia’s downtown post office as part of a series of May Day demonstrations spanning the country.
The protests held on a day commemorating the fight for workers’ rights and the national labor movement was organized by a group that calls itself the 50501 campaign, which stands for 50 protests, 50 states, one movement.
The movement, which originated online, has led to a wave of grassroots protests nationwide since President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The group has had at least four coordinated demonstrations in the past four months, including a gathering that attracted hundreds to South Carolina Statehouse grounds on President’s Day.

While signs, slogans and the issues protesters cared about Thursday went well beyond workers’ rights, organizer Sam Gibbons, of Columbia, said the group did want to highlight workers’ struggles.
At least one organizer from the Union of Southern Service Workers was in attendance and circulating flyers.
And among attendees’ variety of chants was “the U.S. mail is not for sale” in reference to suggestions by the Trump administration that the U.S. Postal Service should be privatized.
Gibbons, a 34-year-old educator, also criticized the administration’s tariff policies and potential impacts to union workers and the middle class.
If we stop importing goods, longshoremen working at Charleston’s port could lose work, he said. And if prices go up, retail workers may be affected.
The protest occurred the same day as Vice President J.D. Vance visited a Nucor steel mill in rural Berkeley County to tout the tariffs as bringing back manufacturing jobs.
Angel Lee, who also helped organize the Columbia event, said she’s worried about possible changes to federal law that impacts those with disabilities. The 46-year-old is disabled and works with a non-profit that aids those with disabilities.
“As a disabled worker and an advocate, I know how hard we have to fight just to be seen,” she said. “All we want is to be able to work with dignity and for fair pay.”
Lee will travel to Washington, D.C., Friday to protest with other members of the movement on the National Mall.

For Margot Robinette, of Columbia, it’s the president’s immigration policy and deportation efforts that are of the greatest concern.
The 26-year-old apothecary shop worker married into a family of immigrants. Her husband is a first-generation American whose parents immigrated to the United States from Honduras, and she said it’s difficult to see those she loves living in fear that they could be deported.
Robinette has also worked alongside immigrants on a farm in California.
“Immigrants are essential workers,” she said. “Workers’ rights and immigrants’ rights intertwined; you can’t talk about one without the other.”
Miguel Torres, of Batesburg, also is the child of immigrants who came to the U.S. from the Guanajuato region of Mexico.

The 22-year-old retail worker attended the protest outside the post office as well as a gathering of legal professionals outside the federal courthouse in Columbia earlier in the day.
Lawyers, federal judges and the dean of the University of South Carolina law school held that separate event as part of National Law Day.
“Attacks on judges for unpopular rulings, political pressure on legal professionals and a growing distrust of the legal system threaten the very foundation of fairness and equal justice,” Columbia attorney Nekki Shutt said in kicking off the program.
U.S. District Court judges DeAndrea Gist Benjamin and Joseph Anderson then led the lawyers in a restatement of their legal oath, which Benjamin said directs legal professionals to serve “without fear or favor, without allegiance to politicians or politics, to honest judgment, regardless of financial or social standing.”
Torres called the arrest of a county circuit court judge in Wisconsin for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant avoid arrest scary.
“The rule of law in our country is just not being respected,” he said. “Every single day on the news it seems like there’s a new executive order.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0367-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)Montana Superintendent of Public Education Susie Hedalen celebrated the signing of House Bill 357 as a “significant step” toward strengthening career and technical education (CTE) for middle school students across the state, the Office of Public Instruction said Tuesday in a news release.
Sponsored by Rep. Eric Tilleman, R-Cascade, HB 357 ensures funding for CTE programs in middle schools, exposing students to career pathways in agriculture, business, health occupations, industrial technology and family and consumer sciences.
HB 357 appropriates $240,000 for the 2027 fiscal year. The bill says the legislature intends the money to be continued in the future.
OPI said the investment helps Montana students build technical knowledge and hands-on experience, “laying the foundation for future success in high-demand fields.”

In a statement, Hedalen thanked Tilleman for his leadership and for recognizing the importance of career and technical education in middle school.
“Montana faces a growing demand for skilled workers, and employers across the state are looking for professionals with both technical expertise and practical experience,” Hedalen said. “HB 357 responds to this challenge by providing the resources necessary for schools to foster career exploration, reduce dropout rates, and connect classroom learning to real-world applications.”
Tilleman said the bill allow grants of up to $5,000 to any CTE program in the state of Montana. High school students already receive similar support, and Tilleman told the Daily Montanan his bill will help bring the same ideas to younger students.
“We’re helping middle schoolers be able to see the employability skills early and give them the foundational elements for work-based learning,” Tilleman said.
OPI will develop and implement guidelines for distributing the funds so they can expand their CTE offerings, the news release said.
Hedalen said CTE not only equips students with the skills they need, it strengthens the workforce, economy and communities.
“The OPI team and educators across Montana are ready to build the bridge between education and industry,” Hedalen said. “Sparking students’ interest and beginning the career exploration journey in middle school will help our students be engaged in their education and see their incredible opportunities for years to come!”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111

Trump executive order targets Vermont’s first-in-the-nation ‘climate superfund’  

by Olivia Gieger 
April 9, 2025, 4:53 pmApril 9, 2025, 5:15 pm 



The climate superfund law, Act 122, applies a polluters-pay framework, like a federal hazardous waste superfund, to the costs of climate damages — like flood recovery. Vermont was the first state in the nation to adopt this framework for climate disasters. In December, New York followed and adopted its own climate superfund bill.The Justice Department also filed lawsuits against three other states, targeting actions that hold oil and gas companies accountable for the costs of climate damages, specifically New York state’s climate superfund, and Hawaii and Michigan’s lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, according to a Justice Department press release.In its release, the Justice Department argues that these state actions “unreasonably burden domestic energy development” and put the US in a “national energy emergency.”“I will just note that there is no national energy emergency,” Clark told VTDigger in April, after Trump issued the executive order. “American energy is at an all time high, and state laws are not a threat to American energy,” she said.Make Polluters Pay, a national campaign that promotes laws and lawsuits that hold fossil fuel companies responsible for the costs of climate damages, called the four federal lawsuits against the states as “political theater, plain and simple,” as Cassidy DiPaola, the communications director said in a press release.“This is not a surprise,” Paul Burns, the executive director of Vermont Public Interest Group said in a press release. VPIRG was instrumental in the construction and passage of the climate superfund law. “This lawsuit is one more instance of our billionaire president holding the fossil fuel industry in a warm embrace by giving Vermonters the finger.”When Trump first filed his executive order targeting the Vermont law, Pat Parenteau, an emeritus professor at Vermont Law School’s Environmental Law Center, explained to VTDigger that the government was likely to argue that the federal Clean Air Act preempts the state law. But those claims ring hollow, he explained, since the federal law deals with the source of emissions, not payments for past emissions. In April, Parentau explained that Vermont should be ready for a long legal battle, saying that the federal government and fossil fuel industry have deep pockets to prolong these lawsuits that aim to “bleed its opponents dry.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trump takes Vermont’s climate superfund law to court.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/charity-clark-1-20240618.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-01 23:21:37+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Goon Squad’ lawsuit settled for $2.5M,Jerry Mitchell and Mukta Joshi,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/01/goon-squad-lawsuit-settled-for-2-5m/,Rankin County officials announced a $2.5 million settlement with two men tortured in a warrantless raid in January 2023.,"Rankin County officials announced Thursday that they had settled a lawsuit filed by Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker—who were brutalized by sheriff’s deputies in 2023—for $2.5 million. 
“This amount, for Mississippi, is historic,” said Trent Walker, the attorney for the two men. “I can’t think of an excessive force settlement larger than this.”
Six Rankin County law enforcement officers handcuffed, beat and shocked Jenkins and Parker with Tasers before shooting Jenkins in the mouth during a warrantless raid of Parker’s home.
“This is the ending of the Michael Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker case from the perspective” of the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, said its lawyer, Jason Dare.
The county’s insurance policy will cover $2 million of that payment, he said. 
The remaining $500,000 will come from the sheriff’s coffers, which is funded by taxpayer dollars, Dare said, but taxpayers won’t have to pay for any increase to the department’s budget.
Last year, a federal judge sentenced the six officers — former deputies Brett McAlpin, Jeffrey Middleton, Christian Dedmon, Hunter Elward and Daniel Opdyke and former Richland police officer Joshua Hartfield — to between 10 and 40 years in federal prison for their roles in the 2023 torture of Jenkins and Parker.
Middleton’s shift called themselves the “Goon Squad” and created a WhatsApp channel and commemorative coins featuring the moniker and drawings of mobsters.
An investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times exposed a decades-long reign of terror by nearly two dozen Rankin County deputies, but the six officers are the only ones who have been charged.
During the officers’ sentencing hearings, former deputies and prosecutors said the torture of Jenkins and Parker was far from isolated. In at least nine incidents over five years, McAlpin brutalized people during arrests, prosecutors said.
“McAlpin is the one who molded these men into what they became,” federal prosecutor Christopher Perras told the judge. “He modeled that behavior for young impressionable officers, and it’s no wonder that they followed his lead.”
Dare said the sheriff’s office has taken steps to ensure such behavior ceases. “The compliance director, Captain Wayne Carter, and the [Internal Affairs] investigators, do an excellent job of going through everything now to make sure that something similar to what happened in January 2023 never happens again,” he said.
The events in Braxton had impacted not only Mr. Jenkins, “but also the Rankin County community and the fine, upstanding law enforcement officers who are with the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, who have weathered the storm that has ensued since that day,” Dare said. “We hope that this resolution brings some sense of finality.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01180341/IMG_0312.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111

Aug. 5, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen chose Kearney police chief Bryan Waugh as the new superintendent for the Nebraska State Patrol. He will replace retiring Colonel John Bolduc and starts in June. 
“Chief Waugh brings over 30 years of law enforcement experience, marked by innovation, collaboration and a public servant’s heart,” Pillen said in a statement. “He has led a growing department, managed a $13 million budget, achieved accreditation and launched programs like the Mental Health Co-Responder Initiative and a citywide license plate reader system that sparked a statewide effort. His leadership during the 2019 flood kept Kearney safe while strengthening community trust.” 
Pillen said he was confident he had chosen the “right person to lead the Patrol and build on its 88-year-old legacy.” The four candidates who were interviewed for the position were already working in Nebraska. Bolduc, who has served as NSP superintendent since 2017, is retiring because the Patrol has a mandatory retirement age of 60. Waugh’s annual salary will be $203,000.
Waugh became the police chief of the Kearney Police Department in 2019. He previously worked at the La Vista Police Department in various roles for 21 years. He also spent four years on active duty as a U.S. Air Force security police and law enforcement specialist at Offutt Air Force Base in Sarpy County.
Waugh said he was incredibly humbled and honored by Pillen picking him. 
“This storied organization’s professional men and women are first-class, dedicated, committed and driven toward providing the highest level of public safety and professional services for the entire state of Nebraska,” Waugh said.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s top political adviser, Matt Moran, temporarily stepped aside from his job as the head of the powerful Spirit of Virginia PAC, the PAC’s chief financial officer confirmed late Thursday evening. 
Lisa Jennings told The Mercury that Moran, who allegedly advised Youngkin to pressure Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid to leave the race, had informed her on Wednesday that he would leave temporarily. A senior administration official said that Moran decided to step away because the controversy created a distraction for himself and his work for the PAC.


Reid, the first openly gay candidate on a statewide ticket in Virginia, said the governor urged him to quit over explicit photos on a social media account bearing the same name as Reid’s but that Reid emphasized he had no connection to.
 Earlier in the day Thursday, two sources familiar with the deliberations had said Moran resigned, as finally reported by Politico. Moran, after multiple requests for comment on the matter, has still not clarified his position.

The shift marks a dramatic fallout in a political storm that has rattled Virginia Republicans, exposed deep internal divisions, and fueled charges of political backstabbing just months before the November elections.
Moran, 36, had remained silent until Wednesday evening when, less than two hours before Reid took the stage alone at a Henrico County GOP rally where Youngkin canceled his appearance, he denied accusations that he tried to bully Reid out of the race. 
“Let me be clear, facts matter, and they will demonstrate the accusations against me are unfounded,” Moran posted on X, formerly Twitter.
“I’ve known John Reid for years and consider him a friend,” Moran wrote, insisting he had been “actively supporting and assisting John as the Lt. Governor nominee.”
Moran also released a sworn affidavit and a sharply worded legal letter from his attorney, George Terwilliger III, pushing back on Reid’s claims. 
The letter argued Reid’s team had been misinformed and warned that continued accusations could bring legal consequences, with Terwilliger writing that Moran “never attempted to extort, coerce, or pressure Mr. Reid” but simply offered “sound advice regarding the viability of Mr. Reid’s candidacy to someone he counted as a friend.” 
Despite that, the letter hinted at a possible off-ramp, asking if Reid’s campaign was open to “scheduling a call where we might further discuss the matter.”
On Thursday, before Moran’s decision to step aside became known, an audio recording surfaced that captured an April 27 meeting between Moran and members of Reid’s campaign, where Moran framed Reid’s withdrawal as the only way to stop damaging opposition research from surfacing — a stance Reid later described as bordering on extortion. 
The rift burst into public view last Friday, when The Richmonder reported that Youngkin had asked Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay candidate on a statewide ticket, in a phone call to step down over sexually explicit posts shared by a Tumblr account with the same name of Reid’s other social media profiles. 
On Sunday, Reid alleged in a video posted online that “representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out.”
While Reid did not initially name Moran, his campaign followed up Monday with a cease-and-desist letter directly accusing Moran of defamation, claiming Moran told reporters Reid was behind the sexually explicit Tumblr account — a charge Reid’s team firmly denies. “While this account shared a common username with our client’s Instagram, he is not and never has been associated with the account,” the letter said.
Moran has spent more than a decade deeply embedded in Virginia politics. He got his start managing the campaign of a rural delegate and working as a legislative aide before climbing the ranks to become spokesman for then-House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford, and later chief of staff to Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights. 
When Youngkin took office, Moran came on board as director of policy and legislative affairs — notably working without a state salary. Instead, he remained on leave from two consulting firms in which he held ownership stakes — Creative Direct and Link Public Affairs. That arrangement drew criticism from those who argued it posed serious conflicts of interest.
Meanwhile, Reid has vowed to continue his campaign as election season kicks into high gear.
Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect that Moran stepped aside from his role as a Spirit of Virginia PAC advisor, as confirmed by the group’s chief financial officer Lisa Jennings Thursday evening.

Moran also released a sworn affidavit and a sharply worded legal letter from his attorney, George Terwilliger III, pushing back on Reid’s claims. 
The letter argued Reid’s team had been misinformed and warned that continued accusations could bring legal consequences, with Terwilliger writing that Moran “never attempted to extort, coerce, or pressure Mr. Reid” but simply offered “sound advice regarding the viability of Mr. Reid’s candidacy to someone he counted as a friend.” 
Despite that, the letter hinted at a possible off-ramp, asking if Reid’s campaign was open to “scheduling a call where we might further discuss the matter.”
On Thursday, before Moran’s resignation became known, an audio recording surfaced that captured an April 27 meeting between Moran and members of Reid’s campaign, where Moran framed Reid’s withdrawal as the only way to stop damaging opposition research from surfacing — a stance Reid later described as bordering on extortion. 
The rift burst into public view last Friday, when The Richmonder reported that Youngkin had asked Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay candidate on a statewide ticket, in a phone call to step down over sexually explicit posts shared by a Tumblr account with the same name of Reid’s other social media profiles. 
On Sunday, Reid alleged in a video posted online that “representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out.”
While Reid did not initially name Moran, his campaign followed up Monday with a cease-and-desist letter directly accusing Moran of defamation, claiming Moran told reporters Reid was behind the sexually explicit Tumblr account — a charge Reid’s team firmly denies. “While this account shared a common username with our client’s Instagram, he is not and never has been associated with the account,” the letter said.
Moran has spent more than a decade deeply embedded in Virginia politics. He got his start managing the campaign of a rural delegate and working as a legislative aide before climbing the ranks to become spokesman for then-House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford, and later chief of staff to Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights. 
When Youngkin took office, Moran came on board as director of policy and legislative affairs — notably working without a state salary. Instead, he remained on leave from two consulting firms in which he held ownership stakes — Creative Direct and Link Public Affairs. That arrangement drew criticism from those who argued it posed serious conflicts of interest.
Meanwhile, Reid has vowed to continue his campaign as election season kicks into high gear.

Vance told a crowd at the Berkeley County mill for the country’s largest steel producer that America is entering “a golden age” for manufacturing.
Vance spoke Thursday at the Nucor mill in rural Huger to celebrate the first 100 days of the Trump administration.
In his 20-minute speech, the vice president categorized the administration’s controversial tariff policy as the catalyst for an incoming boom in U.S. jobs and American-made products.
“One hundred days under Donald Trump’s leadership sparks the beginning of the industrial renaissance in the United States of America,” Vance told the crowd of around 500, made up of steel workers and other invited guests.
“I believe the golden age of American manufacturing started 100 days ago, and we’re building it right here at Nucor steel in South Carolina.”
Vance leaned on his own past as the grandson of a steel worker in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio. He spoke about how his grandfather, who helped raise him, was proud of his profession and could name every American car made from Armco steel.
He told the Nucor steel workers he hopes they get the same satisfaction.
“When you see a lawn mower, a water heater, a kitchen appliance in your neighbor’s home, or your home, I hope every single one of you guys in front of me feel a sense of pride,” Vance said as workers in the crowd nodded their heads. “Because these are the products that make America work.”
The promise of a stable, well-paying job with a good pension that drove people to companies like Nucor has largely disappeared, Vance said.
This administration aims to bring them back, Vance said.
“I think we’ve got to send messages to our young people that the most interesting work — the work that’s going to challenge your mind but also allow you to work with your hands — is found at American steel mills right here in Nucor Berkeley in South Carolina,” Vance said to applause.

Vance was introduced by Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who looked at the crowd and said, “this is red, white and blue, made in America.”
He told them it’s possible to invest in manufacturing and still protect the environment.
“We choose both,” Zeldin told the crowd. “That is the Trump EPA, delivering for the people of South Carolina and delivering for the United States of America.”
Nucor produces a quarter of new steel refined in the U.S. The company is based across the state line in Charlotte, North Carolina, but founded in South Carolina and still employs more than 2,500 people total at locations around the state.
The Berkeley plant alone employs around 1,000 people and produces 3.6 million tons of steel annually.
The company has been a consistent supporter of the Trump administration’s tariff-laden economic plan. A 25% tariff on the importers of foreign steel products went into effect March 12.

Two days ago, Nucor CEO Leon Topalian told CNBC that the company has its biggest backlog in history, specifically mentioning the Berkeley mill in the interview.
Topalian thanked the administration Thursday “for continuing to level the playing field for American steel producers.”
While Topalian continues to back the tariffs, many South Carolina industries, like the state’s multibillion-dollar auto sector, are in a state of flux as they adjust to often-changing announcements about tariffs and how they’ll affect the cost of foreign-made parts used to build vehicles here.
U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state’s lone Democratic congressman, has been a staunch critic of the tariffs.
Clyburn said in a statement Thursday that Trump’s second in command would be better served meeting with South Carolinians “from all walks of life.”
“Trump’s exorbitant tariffs — imposed on countless essential products without any strategy — are increasing costs, jeopardizing retirement savings, threatening jobs, and putting small businesses at risk,” Clyburn said.
“South Carolina stands to be harmed disproportionately,” the statement said.
Vance told the crowd that tariffs are part of an effort to build up middle-class jobs in America, rather than let them be outsourced to other countries.
“Do you want to ship American jobs off to the People’s Republic of China?” He asked. “Do you want to rely on foreign corporations to make the things that you need in your home and your families need every single day?”
The crowd shouted “no” in response to both questions.
“So why don’t we rebuild America’s middle class?” he asked rhetorically. “Why don’t we rebuild American manufacturing? And why don’t we rebuild American industry, just like you’re doing right here.”

Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) testified in support of his House Joint Resolution B, which aims to amend the state constitution to require proof of citizenship for voters. | Kyle DavidsonMichigan House Republicans took votes on several policies aligned with President Donald Trump’s priorities on Thursday, achieving mixed results on measures to ban sanctuary cities, a proposed constitutional amendment intended to bar noncitizens from voting and legislation they say would end diversity, equity and inclusion practices in hiring. 
Though House Republicans successfully advanced several policies tied to undocumented immigration, Rep. Bryan Posthumus’s House Joint Resolution B, which requires residents to show proof of citizenship when casting their ballot and registering to vote, stalled when put to a vote, failing to reach the two-thirds supermajority needed to advance. 
However, the effort to amend the state constitution is not quite dead, with Posthumus (R-Rockford) moving to reconsider the vote and tabling the matter for another session. 
Additionally members of the Board of State Canvassers approved the language and form for a proposal that mirrors the House’s resolution, giving supporters 180 days to gather signatures in order to place the matter before voters on the 2026 ballot.

“There’s a potential that down the road we bring it back up and see what happens then,” Posthumus told reporters after Thursday’s session concluded. 
“Whether it is done legislatively, which, while it failed today, that doesn’t mean it’s dead forever, or whether it’s through the petition drive one way or another, I’m going to make sure it’s on the ballot,” Posthumus said. 
Posthumus first offered the effort in 2024 in response to reports of a 19-year-old University of Michigan student from China casting a ballot in Ann Arbor. 
The Department of State has since identified 15 additional cases of noncitizen voting in the 2024 election out of more than 5.7 million ballots cast.  
“This is a serious issue, one we must address with a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” Benson said in an April 3 statement, noting that only U.S. citizens can legally register and vote in elections. “Our careful review confirms what we already knew – that this illegal activity is very rare. While we take all violations of election law very seriously, this tiny fraction of potential cases in Michigan and at the national level do not justify recent efforts to pass laws we know would block tens of thousands of Michigan citizens from voting in future elections.”
Voting rights advocates have repeatedly warned that Posthumus’ proposal would have serious consequences on the ability of married or divorced women who change their names, seniors and low-income voters to cast their ballot. 
“This is a poll tax, plain and simple. You have to pay money to produce documents in order to vote. That is a poll tax,” state Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth) told reporters ahead of Thursday’s House session.
Though the policy does include a hardship exception to cover the cost for individuals who do not have the necessary documentation, Koleszar questioned whether that would include the middle class. While speaking on the floor, he also pointed to the impact of a similar policy in Kansas, which blocked 31,000 individuals who were otherwise eligible to vote from accessing the ballot. 
Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), the minority vice chair of the election integrity committee, compared the proposal to the Kansas law alongside another policy in Arizona and the SAVE Act proposed in Congress, all of which have drawn criticism for creating barriers to voting. 
The only substantive difference between these policies is that Posthumus’s proposal would leave the implementation details to be hammered out by a future Legislature, Wooden said.
  State Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids) testifying on the House floor on May 1, 2025. | Kyle Davidson
Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing), who previously chaired the House Elections Committee pitched several alternatives to the joint resolution.
“How about having our Department of State do more audits before the elections and not after? What about using existing records to check new registrations on a rolling basis? How about adding bold, not-to-be-missed signage at every polling place laying out the consequences of voting as a noncitizen and let’s put it in some different languages that reflect the population of the district to avoid any potential language barriers,” Tsernoglou said. 
Tsernoglou’s office later announced a set of three bills sponsored by Wooden, Koleszar and State Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren) in cooperation with the Secretary of State’s office as part of the first phase of legislation aimed at tightening up Michigan’s election security.
The proposals include: 

Requiring the secretary of state to compare driver data to voter registration information to identify records of potential non-citizens that need further review.
Giving the secretary of state the ability to remove voters who haven’t voted in 20 years from the voter rolls after notice.
Requiring the secretary of state to regularly review the instructions on the voter registration form to ensure citizenship eligibility requirements are clearly described.

In his own floor speech, Posthumus challenged the arguments put forth by Democrats. While Koleszar noted the number of noncitizens barred from voting by the Kansas law was “statistically indistinguishable from zero,” Posthumus pointed to the 2000 Presidential election, where former President George Bush defeated Al Gore by a 537-vote margin in Florida. He also pointed to multiple recent elections in the Michigan Legislature that had been decided by double digit margins. 
Additionally, Michigan has the benefit of being able to learn from Kansas and Arizona’s mistakes, Posthumus said before urging a yes vote on the proposal. 
In the unlikely case that Posthumus’ proposal achieves the two-third margin needed to pass the House, it would need to win support from two-thirds of members in the Democratic-led Senate before the matter could be placed on the ballot for a majority of Michiganders to decide in the next general election. 
Republicans advance policies on undocumented immigration
Prior to taking a vote on House Joint Resolution B, the chamber cast its first votes of the day on a set of bills banning local and county governments from enacting or enforcing sanctuary city or county policies, ordinances or laws, which typically limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. If the bills become law, any locality with an existing sanctuary policy would have 60 days to eliminate it and comply with state policy.
The bills creating this ban, House Bills 4338 and 4339, passed along party lines, with full support from Republicans’ 58 member majority. However, House Bill 4342 — which would bar any city or village with a sanctuary policy in place from receiving state revenue sharing funds used to pay for key services like police and fire departments, funding for roads and sewers and garbage collection — did see the dropoff of one Republican, Rep. Jaime Greene (R-Richmond). 
Another set of bills, House Bills 4340 and 4341, which aim to bar noncitizens from receiving welfare and housing assistance, gained support from Xiong and fellow Democratic Reps. Peter Herzberg (D-Westland), Tullio Liberati (D-Allen Park), Denise Mentzer (D-Mt.Clemens), and Angela Witwer (D-Delta Township).
However, the bills are unlikely to advance in the Democratic-led Senate, as split control of the Legislature has led to deadlock.
Effort Republicans say would end DEI practices in hiring receives overwhelming support
In an uncharacteristic show of strong bipartisan support, nearly all members present in the House voted in support of a policy Republicans argue would end diversity, equity and inclusion practices in hiring at state agencies. 
House Bill 4288, put forth by State Rep. Erin Byrnes (D-Dearborn) states “a state agency shall not hire an applicant for unclassified employment unless the state agency bases the hiring on 1 or more objective and merit-based factors that include, but are not limited to, the applicant’s relevant education or work experience.” It does not mention diversity, equity or inclusion, or DEI hiring practices.
State Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), who introduced nearly-identical legislation last year, said she was surprised to see Byrnes reintroduce the bill. However, when she began to mention DEI hiring practices, House Minority Floor Leader John Fitzgerald (D-Wyoming) raised a point of order, noting that  “the speech and debate on the floor of this house must contain and be relevant to the bill itself.”

“I do not find that —in the absence of any diversity, equity or inclusion language included in this bill — that that is relevant or germane to the debate here today,” Fitzgerald said.
Rigas was permitted to continue, telling the House “DEI has left us divided and lowered with lowered standards. H.B. 4288 fixes that by demanding objective, merit-based hiring. Agencies that choose to hire by race, identity or anything other than merit will face a $10,000 fine.”
The bill passed with support from 105 members of the 110 member body. State Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) marked the sole vote against the legislation. 
While Wegela requested his name be removed as a cosponsor of the bill, Byrnes requested the board be opened for members to join in cosponsoring the bill, with the bill gaining support from 74 members by the time the voting board was closed. 
Fitzgerald later told reporters the bill was part of a larger pay-equity package, calling Republican’s description of the bill as anti-DEI bill as “a really poor misunderstanding of the legislation.”

“I think that really what we’re focused on is trying to make sure that people who are not necessarily relationally, or have a relationship with their workplace, that they’re applying to don’t get shut out indiscriminately. We want to make sure that people on their merit, on their capability, on their work experience, have the opportunity to do that,” Fitzgerald said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1536-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111

(Provided by Montana State University)A federal judge extended this week an emergency order that prevents the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting two Montana State University graduate students.
Last month, four international students affiliated with the Montana University System had their visas revoked and student visitor records terminated.
The terminations could subject the students to immediate deportation, and two of the students, graduates at MSU, challenged the decision in federal court.
The ACLU of Montana sued on their behalf, and the Trump administration subsequently and separately reinstated them in a database that keeps those records, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS.
However, Alex Rate of the ACLU of Montana said in an email Thursday that the students still need the court to step in because the recent reinstatement does not provide the students ongoing assurance.
“Given the chaos and confusion that the Trump Administration has created for our clients, the only thing that can bring them some certainty is an order from the court,” Rate said in an email. “This Administration’s conduct is cruel and illegal, and we will not stand idly by while our clients’ rights are being trampled.”
NBC News reported Wednesday the revocations affected an estimated 3,000 international students in the U.S.
On April 21, Inside Higher Ed said the terminations had resulted in at least 28 lawsuits across the country.
At a hearing of Roe v. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Missoula, Judge Dana Christensen agreed the reinstatements did not mean the case was moot.
Christensen extended the temporary restraining order an additional 14 days until he had an opportunity to rule on the students’ motion for a preliminary injunction.
A media contact from the U.S. Attorney’s Office District of Montana did not return a call for comment Thursday.
National media outlets said the terminations took place after Homeland Security ran the names of 1.3 million foreign students through a crime database and sent hits to the State Department.
The State Department then revoked visas and told Homeland Security to change their status from “active” to “terminated” in the SEVIS database, which university officials monitor.
The lawsuit said a terminated record requires a student to depart the U.S. immediately, citing a notification the students received from MSU.
However, the lawsuit alleged the visa revocation isn’t a legal justification for the termination of a SEVIS record. It said the students were not provided additional information about the terminations.
Therefore, the ACLU of Montana alleges the government’s actions circumvent the law and appear designed to coerce the students into “self-deporting.”
The lawsuit said the students had done nothing to violate their visa status, but the case challenges the terminations of their records in the SEVIS database, not the visa revocations.
The lawsuit also said the two plaintiffs from MSU had not been convicted of any crimes “in the U.S. or elsewhere” and both were “star students and model members of their respective school communities.”
In Judge Christensen’s emergency ruling, he found the case similar to one in New Hampshire in which the court found the federal government had not followed its own procedures in actions affecting students and violated due process protections.
At a hearing for a case in the Northern District of California in Oakland last week, an attorney for the Justice Department said the federal government would no longer terminate statuses based only on information in the crime database, according to NBC News.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MSU-enrollment-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 20:09:08.607111

DemasTestifying in front of Michigan state lawmakers last legislative session as a survivor of rape was one of the most terrifying and difficult experiences of Emily Bice’s life, she told state Senators Thursday. 
But seeing the legislation to expand the time window survivors of sexual assault have to sue perpetrators fail to make it to the governor’s desk in order to become law was a new level of pain.
This is the fifth session in a row that bills to expand the timeframe survivors of sexual violence have to file civil suits, as well as legislation to eliminate Michigan’s governmental immunity shield against sexual abuse civil cases, have been taken up. Advocates argue Michigan has needlessly narrow statute of limitation laws on filing civil suits after an assault, while it can take a survivor years to disclose abuse, often decades if the victim was a child at the time of the abuse.
Bice told lawmakers on the state Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary, and Public Safety Committee Thursday that at age 19 she wasn’t ready to disclose that she had been raped, much less advocate for herself and seek out justice. She recalled the first therapist she spoke to telling her ‘You were drunk and got into a cab alone. what did you expect to happen?’.
Currently, victims in Michigan have three years after realizing they have been assaulted or until their 28th birthday, whichever is later, to sue their perpetrators. The window used to be even smaller, with the cutoff being a victim’s 19th birthday before 2018, a change that came a result of mass legislative efforts to reform sexual violence laws following the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal, where hundreds of athletes and former patients of the Michigan State University and Olympic gymnastics doctor came forward with their stories of abuse.
By the time the law changed in 2018, it was too late for Bice to sue her perpetrator when she was ready.
“I would not wish the last 10 years on my worst enemy, I would not wish this on anyone. The only thing I would wish for is change. When someone has to go through this, I wish that the world on the other end is kinder to them than it was to me,” Bice said.
Senate Bills 257, 258 and 259 seek to increase the timeframe victims have to file civil suits to 10 years after the crime, 7 years after realizing they have been assaulted or by the time they reach 42 years old.
Michigan has been the backdrop of two of the largest collegiate sex abuse scandals in recent years, bill sponsor Sen. Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores) told senators, with Nassar at MSU and then the late University of Michigan doctor, Robert Anderson, where more than a thousand individuals accused the sports doctor of sexual assault. With all the painful experiences that have “plagued” the state, Hertel said it’s time for lawmakers to learn from what has happened, and help end systematic failures that both abusers and institutions have exploited to avoid accountability.
Survivors of Nassar’s abuse have been at the forefront of the effort to create new laws to protect Michigan from sexual perpetrators and foster system changes aimed to ease the reporting of sexual crimes since 2017. Efforts to eliminate Michigan’s governmental immunity protections for public schools and colleges against liability in sexual violence civil suits have been unsuccessful each session.
Senate Bills 260 and 261 would remove governmental immunity in sexual violence civil cases for public universities, public colleges, and school districts when employees were the perpetrator and the institutions neglected to reasonably prevent, intervene or report the abuse.
It wasn’t until he was 54 years old, when Brian Hurtekant disclosed he had been repeatedly sexually assaulted by a priest his family became close with when he was 13, following the death of his brother.
The two connected over a love of flying, Hurtekant said, as the priest was a private pilot and would take him for rides because Hurtekant dreamed of becoming a pilot.
But the abuse made Hurtekant afraid of being around other men, preventing him from participating in sports, gym class and the Air Force.
“He robbed me… this is a murder of my soul. I could have been better. I still think I did pretty damn good,” Hurtekant said.
All the bills presented Thursday have a history of bipartisanship, though this session there are no Republican sponsors. But it shouldn’t matter what side of the political aisle lawmakers sit on, Hurtekant said, no survivor should be robbed of their day in court after losing so much to sexual violence.

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)This story originally appeared on Stateline.
More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.

Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.

Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

In some instances, state employees told motel program participants that they were ineligible to remain sheltered the very same day that they needed to leave, according to an attorney at Vermont Legal Aid.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.A Vermont Superior Court judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Agency of Human Services, requiring that the state give motel voucher program recipients adequate notice before ending their benefits — and give them enough time to appeal.The order, issued by Chittenden County Superior Court Judge Samuel Hoar on Thursday, says that state officials must provide due process before terminating emergency housing benefits. That means officials must tell motel program participants in writing why their benefits are ending, deliver that notice in a way the person will likely receive, and provide the decision “in advance of any termination to afford a reasonable opportunity to dispute the termination,” Hoar wrote. The notice must also tell individuals they have a right to seek an expedited appeal.“For many people, access to emergency housing is literally a matter of life and death,” said Maryellen Griffin, a staff attorney at Vermont Legal Aid, which is representing service providers and motel program participants in the ongoing case. “This allows people to understand what is happening to them before it happens to them.” The order is the latest ruling in a long-running suit that Legal Aid brought over a year ago, when the organization sought to halt the evictions of motel program participants at the end of the 2024 winter-weather eligibility period. Legal Aid wanted the state to pause evictions at the time in order to adequately screen unhoused people for continued eligibility granted by a newly-passed law, which expanded who counted as having a disability. A judge denied their preliminary injunction last March. The case picked up steam again this spring, Griffin said, as the latest round of evictions from the motel program began on April 1 after a prolonged political battle at the Statehouse.In some instances, state employees told motel program participants that they were ineligible to remain sheltered the very same day that they needed to leave, Griffin said.Susan Merchant, a 53-year-old with severe osteoarthritis who had been living at the Hilltop Inn in Berlin, attested in a court filing that one morning last month, she received a call saying that her voucher was being terminated “and I needed to leave my room.” The day prior, a Department for Children and Families staffer had told her that her voucher had been approved for seven days, according to the filing.Merchant believed she should still be eligible to remain in the program. “I don’t understand what the problem is, and they could not explain it to me,” she attested in the filing.Legal Aid ultimately helped Merchant through the state’s appeal process, Griffin said, and discovered she was simply a missing document. Once that was provided to the Department for Children and Families, Merchant’s voucher was renewed.Thursday’s order gives people a chance to challenge their voucher terminations in instances where they are incorrect, Griffin said. The notices must be provided in writing, not given over the phone, and must be specific to the individual’s case, she said. That differs from a common practice DCF uses when motel program rules change: directing motel owners and service providers to slip general notices under peoples’ doors.For people whose vouchers are terminated for legitimate reasons, the order provides more time to plan their next steps, she added.The order applies to people who have received motel vouchers since September 2024 and either continue to receive the benefit or were “subsequently terminated, not renewed, or informed that they were ineligible.” (The temporary order does not outline retroactive relief for people who have already lost their vouchers, though the court could consider future action.)Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont, said the order is a victory.“This is a huge win for people who are in the hotel/motel program, and certainly for our clients who have been being denied without notice and exited pretty regularly in the last couple of weeks,” she said.The Department for Children and Families did not provide a response to questions on Thursday afternoon.The order will remain in effect for two weeks, until the next hearing in the case on May 16. At that point — if state officials have not proposed a plan to comply with the order that the plaintiffs have agreed with — the judge will decide how to proceed, Griffin said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Judge orders state to give motel voucher recipients more notice before evicting them.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/homeless-hotel-3-20240315.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

Bob Ferguson signed on Wednesday. 
Senate Bill 5337, would require assisted living facilities to be certified by July 1, 2026, to care for people with dementia. This certificate is intended to help ensure the health and safety of residents, transparency for families, and appropriate training for staff.
The Department of Social and Health Services would be required to create, manage and enforce the certification process. 
This bill “brings a baseline level of consistency to the definition for memory care,” said Cathy MacCaul, advocacy director at AARP. 
Facilities do not have to use terms such as “memory care facility” or “specialized dementia care” to be considered a memory care facility. 
Under the new certification, facilities would be required to maintain staff onsite 24 hours a day and provide staff with at least six hours of continuing education. 
A publicly available list of certified assisted living facilities specializing in memory care or that have memory care units would have to be maintained by the Department of Social and Health Services. The department would also conduct regular inspections to ensure the facilities comply with state law. Facilities that do not comply could face civil penalties. 
Memory care or specialized dementia care services vary across the 237 assisted living facilities in Washington, according to an informal study by the state’s Dementia Action Collaborative in 2021. 
This can make it difficult for individuals and families to understand the services and staffing that facilities offer. 
“If a facility wants to say that they’re providing memory care, they have to meet just some basic requirements,” MacCaul said. 
MacCaul said the bill was modeled after Medicaid definitions to ensure consistency. 
Older adults could outnumber children under age 18 for the first time in U.S. history by 2034, according to U.S. Census Bureau projections.
“We have to shift the way we think about all of our systems and make sure that we have adequate consumer protections, consumer awareness and transparency,” MacCaul said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/long-term-care-hospital-wheelchair-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

SPRINGFIELD — A plan to overhaul the way Illinois funds public universities is running into stiff opposition from the state’s largest higher education institution, the University of Illinois System.

The plan, which has been in development for the last four years, calls for adding roughly $1.7 billion in new university funding over the next 10-15 years, but distributing that under a formula that would give priority to schools that are currently the least adequately funded.

Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Westchester, the lead sponsor of Senate Bill 13, said it is designed to bring equity and stability to the state’s higher education system.

“This bill does not just aim to increase funding,” she told a Senate committee Wednesday. “It tells us for the first time in our state's history what students and universities need to succeed and how to adequately fund universities over time to actually meet that need. It defines what universities require to educate, support and graduate students successfully, and then it directs resources to do just that.”

But Nick Jones, executive vice president and vice president of academic affairs for the U of I System, said the proposed formula would be detrimental to the state’s flagship university and that it needs considerably more work before it can be ready for legislative approval.

“The University of Illinois system is absolutely dedicated to expanding equitable access, enhancing student success and promoting statewide economic growth,” he told the committee. “The proposed legislation penalizes institutions that provide the most support for underrepresented and rural students while failing to ensure long-term access.”

History of underfunding

The proposal is a product of a commission that lawmakers established in 2021 — the Illinois Commission on Equitable Public Education Funding. The commission grew out of the Legislative Black Caucus’ efforts that year to enact sweeping social and racial justice reforms in the wake of unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police the previous summer.

“Every university participated in the commission, and the work of the commission acknowledged that Illinois has never had a systemic approach to university funding, nor one that is rooted in student or institutional need,” Lightford said. “Instead, it has been a largely political process.”

Robin Steans, executive director of the advocacy group Advance Illinois, which took part in the commission, said Illinois went through a decadeslong period of steadily cutting its support for higher education, resulting in a system she said is so underfunded it can no longer be sustained.

As recently as 2000, she said, state funding for universities covered about 75% of their overall costs. Today, she said, state funding covers only about 35%, far below the national average of 60%.

“And the only place to go to make that up is tuition,” she said. “And so the lower we go, the more we're pushing those costs to students, pricing them out and driving them out.”

Proposed new formula

The proposed formula would operate much like the Evidence-Based Funding formula, or EBF, that lawmakers adopted in 2017 for K-12 education.

It would start with determining an “adequacy target” for each school to reflect how much they need to meet their educational missions. That would include such things as the cost of instruction and student services, operation and maintenance of physical facilities, and costs associated with meeting the school’s research and public service missions.

Like the EBF formula, that calculation also would take into account the unique attributes of each school’s student body and the higher costs associated with educating certain demographic groups, referred to in the bill as “underrepresented students.”

The formula then measures each school’s “resource profile” – the money it has available from sources such as state aid, tuition and fees, to cover the costs included in its adequacy target.

Those two calculations are used to determine each school’s “adequacy percentage,” which reflects the degree to which a school is underfunded, and its “adequacy gap,” the dollar figure reflecting the difference between its adequacy target and available resources.

According to preliminary calculations made public Wednesday, Western Illinois University in Macomb would rank as the most underfunded public university in Illinois on a percentage basis, with current resources meeting only 45.7% of its adequacy target. But because WIU is relatively small, its total “adequacy gap” would be just $104.3 million, ranking seventh among individual campuses.

In terms of total dollars, the University of Illinois Chicago would have the largest adequacy gap of any  campus, at nearly $475.5 million.

Meanwhile, the state’s flagship university, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, would rank as the best-funded university in the state, at 88.6% of adequacy. But because of its size – with total enrollment in the fall 2024 semester of more than 56,000 – its total adequacy gap would rank fifth among all campuses, at $137.4 million.

U of I opposition

“Although we support several of the key aspirational goals of the bill, we do not agree with the methodology proposed to achieve those goals,” Jones, of the U of I System, told the committee. “Nor do we agree that this will provide what the University of Illinois needs to succeed.”

Jones noted the U of I System as a whole – including the Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield campuses – enroll more than half of all public university students in Illinois, including 45% of all those who qualify for Pell grants, the federal need-based financial aid program for higher education. And yet, under the proposed formula, he said the U of I System would receive only 28% of any new funding provided in the first year of the program.

In addition, he said the proposal also includes a formula for allocating any potential funding cuts that could happen in future years, one that would protect schools that are least adequately funded while requiring those closest to their adequacy target to bear the brunt of the cuts. Under that formula,  the U of I System would absorb 74% of any future funding cuts.

“The University of Illinois system would support adopting a tiered, mission-aligned approach that better recognizes the distinct missions of the universities and equitably funds institutions based on their specific needs and contributions to student success and the state's economic priorities,” Jones said. “This approach would ensure that funding supports student outcomes holds institutions accountable for results and drives true equitable distribution of the state's investment in higher education.”

The Senate committee took no action on the bill Wednesday. An identical bill, House Bill 1581, is pending in the House. It is sponsored by Rep. Carol Ammons, D-Urbana, and is cosponsored by House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, D-Hillside, and Rep. Katie Stuart, D-Edwardsville, who chairs the House higher education budget committee.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerAs the Senate passed its “Big Bill” on the state’s 2026 budget today, Senate Republicans took a big swing on a suite of environmental rollbacks.Minority leader Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia proposed two amendments to H.493: one would have repealed both the clean heat standard and a clause in the Global Warming Solutions Act that opens the state up to lawsuits for failing to meet mandated emissions reductions. Beck’s second amendment proposed pushing back the timeline for adopting California’s electric vehicle standards, which would phase in widespread EV adoption starting next year.Neither amendment got an up or down vote. Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, who presides over the chamber, deemed each one “not germane” to the budget bill, in response to concerns raised by Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central.Both times, Beck called for suspending the Senate’s rules so the amendments could be taken up, regardless of their germaneness to the budget. But senators rejected those motions on mostly party-line, roll-call votes.“I think he wanted to be able to have a roll call vote on it to have a political statement made,” said Sen. Becca White, D-Windsor, who sits on the Transportation Committee. The time for looking at pushing back adoption of the California standards would have been when the Senate approved its transportation bill, White said. “I think he essentially missed his opportunity and was trying at a second bite of the apple to bring it onto the budget.” Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington, who chairs the Natural Resources & Energy Committee, disagreed with the floor amendment tactic too. “I think that trying to circumvent the committee process where you can properly vet ideas, where you can hear multiple perspectives, where you can tune language to be the best product is bad governance,” she said in an interview. Repealing the clean heat standard became a rallying point for Republicans last fall — though current law required the Public Utility Commission to report to the Legislature on how to put the framework in place, which happened in January. No further action has been proposed, but the lingering uncertainty surrounding whether lawmakers would implement the policy is an undue stress on Vermonters, Beck said in an interview. “Vermonters out there (are asking) ‘are you gonna put a 58 cent tax on me or not?’” As for the Global Warming Solutions Act and California vehicle standards, Beck said the state is not on track to meet the deadlines either one mandates. “There’s a whole lot of good that comes from shifting away from carbon, but we can only do that as fast as the technology and the affordability of the technology is,” he said. “We need to be more realistic about what that glide slope really looks like. Then, in three to five years, maybe there’s new technology, and maybe we have more resources, but we can’t bankrupt businesses and families to do this.” Senate Democrats agree that the state is not on track to meet the mandates of the Global Warming Solutions Act.“By 2030, Governor Scott will have had a decade to have gotten on track, and he has not,” Watson said. “What I am most interested in is not letting up. If you change the deadline, if you take away the teeth of any of the aspects of it, that reduces the sense of urgency that I think this issue deserves.”In the knowIn a well-timed vote that coincided with International Workers’ Day, the Vermont House of Representatives on Thursday passed Proposal 3, an amendment to the Vermont Constitution that would affirm the right of employees to organize unions and collectively bargain. The Senate approved the amendment in March. Both chambers had previously approved the measure in 2024. The amendment states that “no law shall be adopted that interferes with, negates, or diminishes the right of employees to collectively bargain.” The proposal also includes a constitutional protection for workplace agreements that require workers to join a union as a condition for employment. That means the measure would prohibit a future legislature from passing so-called “right to work” laws, which have been enacted in 26 states and which functionally outlaw such agreements. Thursday’s vote was just the latest in a long series of steps in the state’s ratification process. The next hurdle will be the 2026 November election, when Vermont voters will weigh in. The amendment succeeds if the  ballot question receives a majority vote.— Habib SabetOn the moveThe Senate on Thursday passed its proposed state budget for the 2026 fiscal year, which starts in July.The plan includes more state spending than in the version approved by the House, or that was presented by Gov.

John Sauer said an order from a federal judge in California stripped a national security-based power from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.“So long as the order is in effect, the Secretary must permit hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so is ‘contrary to the national interest,’” Sauer wrote.The emergency appeal, which asks the court to rule as soon as possible, was not available on the Supreme Court website late Thursday afternoon but a copy was uploaded by Politico.The appeal came after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the administration’s request to pause an order from a trial court that blocked Noem’s decision to end Temporary Protected Status for one group of Venezuelans whose protections President Joe Biden extended.U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California issued a nationwide pause in early April, noting the immigrant rights groups and TPS holders who brought the suit had a strong claim under the equal protection clause of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment because Noem has “made sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries.”The equal protection clause was meant to bar the government from discriminating against classes of people.Chen was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011.President Joe Biden granted protections until October 2026 for two groups of Venezuelans. His administration granted about 250,000 Venezuelans TPS in 2021 and 350,000 more in 2023.Noem cited gang activity as her reason for not extending TPS for the 2023 group of Venezuelans, which, without a court intervention, were set to end in early April after she vacated the protections set under the Biden administration.TPS allows nationals from certain countries deemed too dangerous to return to remain in the U.S. temporarily. Those with the status have deportation protections and are allowed to work and live in the U.S. for 18 months, unless extended by the Homeland Security secretary.",,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

Overall, the budget senators approved Thursday totals $9.01 billion, while the Republican governor’s proposal totaled $8.99 billion. Last year, Scott’s repeated criticism of spending approved by the Democratic-controlled Legislature paid political dividends after a historic number of seats in both chambers flipped toward the GOP in November’s election. As a result, Democrats no longer have enough seats in each chamber to override a budget veto, as they did in 2023.“I do expect — and, Vermonters expect — that legislators will work with us to find common ground,” Scott told reporters last week at one of his regular Statehouse press conferences. “Instead, I’m concerned.”Floor debateAs it stands, the Senate’s 2026 budget would add about $50 million more to the state’s “base” spending — money expected to fund recurring expenses year-over-year — than Scott proposed, and about $25 million more in base spending than the House added.That spending includes a dozen new state government positions that Scott didn’t propose in January, including at the Vermont Labor Relations Board, the Green Mountain Care Board and a position at the Attorney General’s Office to support the state’s legal challenges to President Donald Trump’s administration, according to Perchlik.Scott’s Secretary of Administration, Sarah Clark, said at the press conference last week that the number of positions in the Senate’s budget was, also, too high. She argued the chamber would be creating too many future spending obligations at a time the state is facing deep uncertainty over potential actions by the federal government.Gov. Phil Scott speaks during his weekly press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerSen. Robert Norris, R-Franklin, said on the floor Wednesday that there were far more requests for new state positions than the Senate Appropriations Committee chose to put in the budget — and some state entities “made out better than others.” When the budget was up for final approval Thursday, Norris voted for it, as did the panel’s two other GOP members.Perchlik said on the floor Wednesday, before the budget bill won initial approval, that, overall, he thought his committee developed “a balanced budget that we thought was good for Vermonters and put us on a stable financial path for the future.” Still, he told reporters that he expects some of the Senate’s proposed positions will be cut in the upcoming conference committee process.Several GOP senators echoed Scott’s concerns over the amount of spending in the budget bill ahead of the final vote Thursday. The vote was also preceded by attempts by Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, to insert measures into the budget bill to make changes to existing state laws aimed at combating climate change.Perchlik and Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, raised objections on two separate occasions to the chamber considering Beck’s amendments, saying the proposals were not relevant to the budget debate. Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, who presides over the Senate, ruled in agreement both times, saying that Beck’s proposals were not “germane” to the legislation on the floor. Beck moved twice to suspend the chamber’s rules so the amendments could be taken up, regardless of Rodgers’ ruling. But senators rejected both of those motions. Senators then voted 20-10 to pass the budget, overall, with Beck and several other GOP senators backing it. Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, voted against it, after telling her colleagues that she didn’t think the bill adequately prepared the state, or some social services providers, for potential cuts to federal spending. Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, a Chittenden Central Progressive/Democrat, also voted against the legislation.Perchlik, on the floor, pointed to a measure in the budget that would set aside some future state revenue — an estimated $45 million — to plug federal funding gaps.The Senate’s budget also includes funding for some of the measures that were in this year’s annual “budget adjustment” legislation that the House and Senate passed, versions of which were then twice vetoed by Scott, including flood recovery grants to certain municipalities and funding for county courthouse upgrades.Key differencesA large part of the Senate’s proposed spending increase — $19 million — comes from a push to continue drawing on the state’s general fund to support subsidies to families paying for child care. Scott had proposed reducing the general fund appropriation for that purpose by $19 million, after a payroll tax set up to support the subsidies brought in more money than the state expected, while at the same time, the program’s uptake was lower than expected.The House backed Scott’s proposal, which had drawn criticism from advocates for the state’s child care providers. Defending the Senate Appropriations Committee’s move on the floor, Baruth said he thought Scott’s, and the House’s, proposal “could create a tradition, or a practice, of slowly reducing the amount of general fund money — and that could destabilize the program, in our opinion.”The Senate’s budget also proposed setting aside an additional $10 million under a proposed new state framework for providing emergency housing. The money is tied to a bill that cleared the House last month and provides a potential off-ramp to the state’s mass use of motels as a primary form of shelter, among other measures.The bill, H.91, is now being reviewed by the Senate Health and Welfare Committee. Scott’s administration is opposed to putting any more money into the budget for the motel voucher program than it first proposed in January, Clark, Scott’s secretary of administration, said last week during the governor’s press conference.Another sticking point in budget negotiations could be the specific programs the budget funds to support new housing construction, and to what extent. For instance, legislators have earmarked more money for the independent Vermont Housing and Conservation Board than Scott proposed — but the governor wants more money for certain programs run by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency than, for instance, the House approved.The House and Senate proposed different spending for some housing programs from each other, too, something legislators said will feature in the conference committee negotiations. The committee could convene as soon as Friday, according to Baruth’s chief of staff, Ashley Moore. On the floor Thursday, Baruth also echoed Perchlik’s comments to reporters the day before.“It is impossible to predict what will come out of a conference committee — but if I had to predict, I would say that what we will see would be fewer positions and slightly less spending,” he said. “That would be my guess, based on conversations with people on both sides of the building — and understanding (Scott’s) position on this.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Senate approves 2026 budget proposal, but legislators expect to cut spending further amid Gov.

Port of Seattle Commissioner Ryan Calkins predicts a 40% reduction in cargo, as President Donald Trump continues his tariff crusade with 145% levies on China, which has responded with retaliatory measures. That lost business means a similar drop in work for local longshoremen, truckers and warehouse workers. 
On a press call Thursday with port officials and senators from Washington, Oregon and California, Calkins said the effects “will ripple out through the whole economy in our port communities.”
“Fewer ships from across the Pacific means less cargo at our ports,” said U.S. Sen Patty Murray of Washington. “Less cargo at our ports means less goods for our truckers to transport, and that ultimately means bare shelves for our retailers and the American consumer.”
Murray, a Democrat representing one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation, compared the looming problem for small businesses reliant on trade to their plight during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Up to this point, local ports have seen surging traffic as shippers looked to get ahead of the tariffs Trump has long promised. While he has pulled back drastic levies planned across the board, the taxes on Chinese imports remain.
International imports in March were up 18% from March 2024 at the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, according to the Northwest Seaport Alliance, which oversees both. Exports increased almost 3%.
In Seattle, total trade volume was still up 7.3% from March 24 to April 24 this year compared to last year. 
Washington’s ports are still reeling from the consequences of tariffs imposed when Trump was first in office. 
That time around, import taxes on India undercut a booming apple export industry, with 11,000 containers shipped from Seattle and Tacoma in 2018 falling to about 360, said Dick Marzano, a Port of Tacoma commissioner. Years later, that number only returned to around 3,500 in 2024, a testament to the potential long tail of protectionist trade policies.
In a White House press briefing Thursday, top Trump adviser Stephen Miller defended the continued tariffs. 
“We need to have a trade relationship with China that does not do harm to our nation’s economic and national security,” he said. “At the same time, tariffs will bring significant revenue into this country that will allow us to pursue our dramatic plan of tax cuts and reforms.”
Calkins was in Virginia this week trying to gin up business from “renewable energy cargo,” like wind turbine blades and transformers. The seaport alliance has also sent delegates to Vietnam and South Korea in hopes of finding more customers to diversify away from relying on China. 
“We’re looking at all avenues to open up markets,” Marzano said.
But all those conversations are “conditional on resolution to the trade dispute,” Calkins said. 
“We’re having to play the long game here in hopes that either Trump comes to his senses,” he added, “or Congress and Republicans in Congress are willing to check his power.”
Other threats and oversight
Meanwhile, the state this week warned of trouble from China potentially suspending Boeing imports due to growing trade tensions with the United States.
Last year, Washington’s top export was civilian aircraft, engines and parts, worth $17 billion, according to the state Office of Financial Management. China accounted for $4 billion of that. Losing that revenue could, in turn, cost the state over $19 million in business and occupation tax proceeds.
The warned suspension, which China has walked back, could mean 19,000 fewer jobs and $1.7 billion in lost labor income. 
At the same time, new car registrations in Washington surged 18%, partly due to consumer anticipation that tariffs could push up auto prices, according to the Office of Financial Management. 
Washington state Treasurer Mike Pellicciotti met with local officials in Port Angeles on Tuesday. They told him about flagging logging exports and tourism from Canada, as well as businesses “freezing plans while they hope for more stable future conditions.”
“This is the backbone of the economy being broken all while the cost of groceries, housing and services are going up,” Pellicciotti told reporters Wednesday. “America is losing and growing weaker under the president’s economic policies.”
Pellicciotti was one of 11 state financial officers to pen a letter Wednesday to Republican congressional leadership calling on them to assert their authority in trade and broader fiscal policy. 
“We will continue to do our part: safeguarding public funds, managing risk, and investing in our people,” they wrote to House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota. “But if Congress does not rise to this moment, no state government will be able to shield its citizens from the consequences.”
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, has bipartisan legislation aiming to do exactly that.
Introduced last month, Cantwell’s Trade Review Act of 2025 would require the president to notify Congress of the imposition or increase in a tariff within 48 hours. The notice must explain the rationale and analyze potential impacts to the country’s businesses and consumers.
Within 60 days, Congress would have to pass a joint resolution approving the new tariff, or it would expire. Congress could also end tariffs at any time via resolution.
While the measure has attracted some Republican support, it has little chance of overcoming the hefty Trump-loyal wing of the party. Though Johnson opened the door ever so slightly Wednesday for potential congressional intervention. 
On Wednesday, a separate resolution seeking to undo Trump’s import taxes failed on a 49-49 vote in the U.S. Senate, with three Republicans joining Democrats.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/port-of-seattle-1024x595.jpg,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

Steve Drazkowski, R-Mazeppa, offered an amendment to a transportation funding bill Thursday that would mandate the Minnesota Department of Transportation use digital road signs that “convey a clear and simple message without witticisms, colloquialisms, neologisms, portmanteaus, hashtags, electronic or internet shorthand or slang, popular culture references that target or are comprehended by a limited segment of the driving population, or any other message relying on hidden meanings, targeted cultural knowledge, or unconventional syntax to understand the message.”
Drazkowski explained during a floor speech that MnDOT’s use of wit in its safety messages — which he called “Big Brother type messages — is distracting and dangerous.  
He read a few of the digital billboards in use by MnDOT in recent weeks. 
“Only the hot dish should be baked. Don’t drive high.”
“Weed like to remind you that driving high is illegal.”
“Don’t rely on a four-leaf clover. Drive safe and sober.”
The messages compel drivers, Drazkowski said, “to figure out what the message means and having the neurons in your head focusing on that, all the while distracting you as a  driver from the roadway.”
Drazkowski — who opposed the cell phone-while-driving ban in 2019 — cited an article in Science by a University of Minnesota researcher and a colleague, which used data from a Texas study to warn that “cognitive overload” can increase distraction and accidents.
Indeed, NPR reported last year that the federal government has issued recommendations “that states phase out signs that have ‘obscure’ meanings or use pop-culture references that could require drivers ‘greater time to process.'”
State Sen. Ann Johnson Stewart, who is a DFL civil engineer of Wayzata, said on the Senate floor that she’d called friends at MnDOT and been assured the signs are safe and merely a fun way to get the public — and especially children — involved in road safety.
Drazkowski, who has had moments of internet fame, like when he repeated debunked tales about schools providing litter boxes for students who identify as cats, said MnDOT shouldn’t be making the decision: “I did expect my Democrat friends to call the government. It’s one of my frustrations with this place … it’s reflexive: What does the government wanna do?  They just wanna fun. Fun kills at 65 miles per hour.”

(Screenshot, WPTV)The Florida Legislature on Thursday sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis a bill that would put an end to a 35-year-ban that prevents people from filing lawsuits against physicians and hospitals for medical malpractice.
The 33-4 vote by the Florida Senate capped a tumultuous 24-hours in which the main sponsor paused action on his bill a day earlier after the Senate narrowly rejected his call to cap how much someone could collect in a medical malpractice.
“It needs to be repealed, it is unjust,” said Sen. Clay Yarborough, the Republican who sponsored the legislation, of the litigation ban.

The question is what will happen next. DeSantis has complained loudly about the influence of “liberal trial attorneys.” Yarborough on Thursday told reporters there was a chance the governor could nix the bill.
Under existing law, parents of single, childless, adult children cannot sue for noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering. Adult children, defined as those 25 and older, are also banned from pursuing wrongful death claims for single parents who die from medical malpractice. ‘
HB 6017 would completely eliminate this prohibition in law. It passed over strong opposition from groups such as the Florida Hospital Association, Florida Medical Association, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and insurance industry lobbyists.
Florida Justice Reform Institute William Large said he will ask the governor to veto the bill.
“This bill is bad for Floridians. It’s bad for consumers. This bill will only increase healthcare costs for all Floridians,” Large told the Florida Phoenix, adding that he estimates as many as 500 additional lawsuits annually will result from eliminating the ban.

The vote for final passage Thursday followed emotional testimony wherein state Sen. Gayle Harrell’s voice cracked as she explained that she was being targeted by billboards for her opposition to the bill.
Harrell, a long-time champion of the medical profession, said she would have supported the expansion of lawsuits against physicians and hospitals if, in exchange, the Senate agreed to put a $1 million limit on wrongful death recoveries for all medical malpractice incidents.
Harrell said she was moved throughout the session by testimony from residents who shared stories of how their children, parents, and loved ones died allegedly from medical malpractice but were prevented from seeking redress in court. But, at the end of the day, she said she believes that without damages caps, physicians and hospitals will face increased costs and stop practicing.

“I can tell you we are going to have a huge increase in medical malpractice. And in addition we are going to have physicians not coming to the state of Florida,” she said.
Harrell said she has been targeted for her position. The Republican from Stuart didn’t say who was behind the intimidation.
“I can tell you this has become very difficult for me, personally. I am getting personal attacks on it because of my stand. There is now a billboard in front of my neighborhood saying Gayle Harrell supports profits over people,” she said, adding there is a “double billboard”  “attacking” her in another nearby neighborhood.
“And I can tell you, that is very devastating to anyone in a political situation where they think Gayle Harrell puts profits over people. I do not. I do not,” she said.
Harrell’s remarks solicited anger from a bipartisan group of senators who came to her defense.
Former Senate Democratic leader turned independent Sen. Jason Pizzo said: “I want you to hear me now. Nobody has done more to provide access to health care than Gayle Harrell. So if you know the person who put up the billboard, I’m not affecting anyone’s First Amendment rights, but you can tell them that Jason Pizzo won’t like them when he finds out who they are.”

Pizzo announced later that he had reached someone who had promised to take down the billboards.
Sen. Jim Boyd, a Republican from Bradenton, extolled Harrell for her work over the years on issues involving children, the elderly, and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
“There’s nobody more caring than you,” Boyd told Harrell. “An attack on you is an  attack on us. Anybody from St. Augustine or anywhere else in Florida that would put up a sign like that ought to think twice about it. It’s not fair. It’s not right. And it can’t be tolerated.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative bill designed to help implement medical cannabis in Nebraska narrowly advanced from committee Thursday in the waning days of the 2025 session.
Legislative Bill 677, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, advanced 5-3 from the General Affairs Committee. It would set up a clearer state regulatory scheme for the medical cannabis system that voters overwhelmingly approved in November. Just two weeks ago, the bill failed to advance 3-5 after no committee member tried to adopt a narrowing amendment.
A new “compromise” amendment adopted Thursday passed with one major change: up to 2 ounces of cannabis flower or bud could be sold to a qualified patient or caregiver.
Smoking would not be allowed, and post-traumatic stress would not be a qualified medical condition, similar to the most recent version of LB 677 from Hansen.

The latest changes won over conservative State Sens. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue and Stan Clouse of Kearney, who voted to advance the bill with three Democrats, State Sens. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Dan Quick of Grand Island and Victor Rountree of Bellevue.
State Sens. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, Barry DeKay of Niobrara and Jared Storm of David City, all Republicans in the officially nonpartisan body, again opposed LB 677.
Hansen, a Republican, said Thursday’s action is the “first step of a few to move the ball forward, but instead of it being stagnant, it’s like you finally gave it a kick.” 
‘We are extremely happy’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, whose son would benefit under the law, said LB 677’s advancement to the legislative floor was an “extremely huge win” for patients and advocates who have fought for more than a decade for the measure.
That timeline includes three ballot campaigns, multiple court cases and numerous legislative bills, including the most recent bill in 2021, which stalled by one vote.
“I think today we saw that the determination and the grit and the hurdles and the setbacks, they’ve all been worth it,” Eggers told reporters. “We are extremely happy.”

Hansen has said getting LB 677 passed this spring is critical to prevent the “Wild West,” as it’s unclear what would happen without state funds or clearer enacting legislation for the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission that voters also created. The law allows patients to possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation.
The Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee plans to provide an extra $30,000 to the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, at the executive director’s request, to cover additional duties that his staff will jointly take on with the Medical Cannabis Commission.
The three commissioners on the Liquor Control Commission also serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission. LB 677, as amended, would explicitly allow commission staff to share resources in carrying out each group’s respective responsibilities.
‘It has to be done the right way’
Storm and Andersen again led opposition to LB 677 during a committee meeting over concerns it represented “big marijuana” and that the proposal, as advanced, essentially enables recreational marijuana, which Hansen denies.
Andersen called the latest iteration of LB 677 among the “most liberal” and asked how lawmakers could rectify LB 677 with the position of Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers that the Legislature should not act on any medical marijuana legislation. 
Holdcroft and Cavanaugh, the chair and vice chair of the General Affairs Committee, repeatedly pushed back and said they had to do something for the voters and that Hilgers’ opinion was just that, an opinion.
Part of the concern is that passing LB 677 could nullify the pending appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court over whether the ballot measures should have been allowed to be voted on. In Lancaster County District Court, Hilgers lost.

This week, in an interview with Nebraska Public Media, Hilgers described the situation as a 60-yard or 65-yard game-winning field goal when there was “clearly” an offensive player offside or who had a false start, or some other penalty. In his analogy, Hilgers is the referee.
“It has to be done the right way or it shouldn’t count,” Hilgers said in that interview.
Holdcroft in March, questioning a representative of the AG’s Office opposing LB 677 at the bill’s public hearing, said he felt Hilgers “wants us to keep this law stupid, where he can find some loopholes in it and make it illegal.”
“The Legislature just isn’t that kind of body,” Holdcroft said at the time.
The ‘black market’
DeKay questioned whether LB 677 could lead to the “black market,” because of a patient’s immunity from possessing cannabis regardless of the source. Hansen’s bill would tax medical cannabis the same as other products — 5.5 cents per $1, prior to local sales taxes.
Cavanaugh, a lawyer, said black markets thrive on uncertainty and that if DeKay, Andersen or Storm wanted to stop that, then they should support LB 677.
“I am in favor of this because the voters voted for it, and this makes it safe, regulated and accessible,” Cavanaugh said, though he said he wished the bill also allowed PTSD as a qualifying condition.

Clouse indicated that he still would have some amendments coming to the bill — the specifics of which he didn’t share. He has said he wants to allow the governor to appoint up to two more outside members in addition to the two he can already appoint. The governor also already appoints the three commissioners to the Liquor Control Commission.
Outside appointees, Clouse said, could perhaps include law enforcement or supply chain representatives. LB 677 would require at least one appointee to be a health care practitioner. Members would serve six-year terms.
Gov. Jim Pillen this week appointed Lorelle Mueting, the prevention director of Heartland Family Service, which, among other things, connects people to substance abuse treatment, and Dr. Monica Oldenburg, an anesthesiologist, to the commission. Both women opposed recent medical cannabis proposals in Nebraska, Oldenburg in 2019 and Mueting in March.
The General Affairs Committee will host hearings on the appointments this session.
At one point during the sometimes contentious afternoon meeting, Holdcroft said he wasn’t going to convince Andersen or Storm and called the vote. Holdcroft said the full Legislature deserved to be able to debate LB 677, with a chance of passage.
Other changes to the bill
Other changes advanced as part of the amended LB 677, from what voters decided in November, include limiting a qualified “health care practitioner” to licensed physicians, osteopathic physicians, physician assistants or nurse practitioners and practitioners. Medical providers could not recommend cannabis unless they have treated the patient for at least six months or if the provider primarily practices in Nebraska.
Currently, a provider just has to be licensed anywhere in the country and follow the law to write a recommendation.
Under existing statute, which has been the case since December, Nebraskans can use medical cannabis with a doctor’s recommendation for any ailment.

The amendment would limit “qualifying medical conditions” to 15 ailments, similar to a list drafted by former State Sen. Anna Wishart of Lincoln with the Nebraska Medical Association on a previous bill:

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Autism with frequent self-injurious or aggressive behavior.
Cancer.
Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.
Epilepsy or epileptic seizures.
Hepatitis C that causes moderate to severe nausea or cachexia.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Huntington’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease.
Spinal cord injury or disease with residual neurologic deficits.
Terminal illness with a probable life expectancy of under one year.
Tourette’s syndrome.
A serious medical condition or related treatment that causes severe nausea or cachexia.
Severe and persistent muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or muscular dystrophy.
Severe or chronic pain lasting longer than six months that is not adequately managed, in the opinion of a health care practitioner, despite treatment attempts using either conventional medications other than opioids or opiates or physical interventions.

Acceptable forms of cannabis would include edibles, concentrates, ointments, transdermal patches or creams, nebulizers and vaporizer cartridges or pens. Products intended for smoking, such as bongs or joints, could not be sold.
Andersen and Storm said Nebraskans would just buy the flower or bud and make joints, which Cavanaugh and Holdcroft said would not be permitted.
The path ahead
Eggers, Hansen and Holdcroft all noted the path ahead wouldn’t be easy, with Eggers describing it as a “huge journey” and Holdcroft saying he anticipated an “uphill battle.”
Hansen said that it was still too early to tell whether he could get 33 votes and pass the bill over the finish line. That’s the minimum amount of votes needed under the Nebraska Constitution to amend a state law enacted by voters, regardless of a promised filibuster. Unlike other ballot measures this spring, supporters asked for companion legislation to beef up the proposal.

Holdcroft said he would argue in favor of the measure but would “reserve” his vote to see how the debate goes.
This Saturday in La Vista, Sunday in Omaha and Monday in Lincoln, Holdcroft, Hansen and Cavanaugh will host public forums for the public to weigh in on medical cannabis. Eggers said Thursday also represented that senators were listening to voters on this issue and encouraged any Nebraskans to get engaged.
Much of the next two weeks will be consumed by debate on the state budget. LB 677 is expected to be debated to its maximum debate limit across three stages of debate, lasting a combined 13 hours, leaving a tight timeline for LB 677 to become law.
The bill would need to pass by June 2, in case it is vetoed by the governor, who has so far declined to weigh in on the bill but has joined Hilgers in saying the two have reservations.
Hansen noted Hilgers’ opposition is nothing new but that Hilgers, a former state senator and speaker of the Legislature, is a friend whom he trusts on many things. 
“This is just one thing we differ on,” Hansen told the Nebraska Examiner.
Hansen continued: “I think he might know the legalities more than I do, but I know what the people want and what they deserve and what they voted for. We kind of have to meld those two things together somehow.”

(Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)After being temporarily barred from deporting four international students at the University of Iowa who are suing the Department of Homeland Security for revoking their status as students, the agency is now contesting the students’ wish to remain anonymous.
The students’ lawsuit, filed last month in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, identifies the plaintiffs only as John Doe No. 1 through 4.
According to the lawsuit, each of the plaintiffs was admitted to the United States on an F-1 student visa. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs claim the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has violated their due process rights by terminating their student status without legal justification or explanation.
Named as defendants in the case are Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is a part. Also named as a defendant is Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons.
On April 25, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger granted the students’ request for a temporary restraining order, blocking any efforts at deportation. Ebinger concluded the students had “demonstrated a likelihood of success” as to their legal claims and had also shown they could otherwise be subjected to irreparable harm.
The judge noted there had been no suggestion that any of the recognized, lawful reasons for terminating the plaintiffs’ status as students — such as providing false information to the government, engaging in unauthorized employment, or failing to engage in an approved course of study — appeared to exist or were even argued by Homeland Security as a justification for its actions.
“In the overwhelming majority of recent, similar cases, district courts have found orders for temporary relief appropriate,” Ebinger ruled.
In granting the order before the federal government had a chance to argue against it, Ebinger stated the students had been notified that their deportation “could occur at any moment without time permitted to secure possessions or conclude affairs.”
Order bars Noem from pursuing deportation
The judge’s April 25 order instructs Noem and Lyons to restore the plaintiffs’ status as students and further instructs them that they “shall not arrest, detain, or transfer plaintiffs John Doe No. 1, John Doe No. 2, John Doe No. 3, or John Doe No. 4 out of this court’s jurisdiction, or order the arrest, detention or transfer of plaintiffs out of this court’s jurisdiction, without first providing adequate notice to both this court and the plaintiffs’ counsel.”
In a motion filed April 28, U.S. Department of Justice lawyers for Homeland Security argued the case should not be allowed to proceed with the student plaintiffs identified only by pseudonyms — in part because, as a practical matter, the government needed the identifying information not only to defend the case but to comply with the court’s temporary restraining order blocking deportation of the four students.
According to the response filed two days later by the students’ attorneys, the government was informed on April 29 of the students’ identities. However, they argued, the names of the students should not be disclosed to the general public. Such disclosure, they say, would put the students “at risk for harassment, retaliation, detention, and deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”
They are now asking the court to let the case proceed under pseudonyms and to also issue a protective order regarding Homeland Security’s use of the students’ personal information.
They argue that while the federal government tries to “downplay the level of retaliation, harassment, and government enforcement” the students might face if their names were revealed to the general public, the students “fear public retaliation, given this hotly contested and socially charged issue … This fear is fueled by emails from the Department of State (giving) each plaintiff warning they could be immediately arrested, detained and deported — and could even be deported to some third country, rather than their home country.”
A hearing on the students’ motion for a preliminary injunction is now scheduled for Monday, May 5.
Students: Homeland Security has sparked ‘chaos’ 
Since beginning their studies, the lawsuit claims, the plaintiffs have maintained their status as students, are in good academic standing and have not committed any serious criminal offenses. Three of the four are studying chemical engineering, economics or exercise science, while the fourth is working for the State of Iowa as an epidemiologist.
The lawsuit claims that on April 10, 2025, ICE abruptly canceled, without explanation, the plaintiffs’ status as students within DHS’ Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database. The same day, the plaintiffs each received emails from the University of Iowa’s International Students and Scholars Services informing them of the cancellation and the fact that the university was not responsible for the action.
Four days later, the lawsuit claims, three of the plaintiffs’ visas were revoked without explanation. The three each received identical messages from U.S. embassies, warning them that “remaining in the United States can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation,” and adding that “deportation can take place at a time that does not allow the person being deported to secure possessions or conclude affairs in the United States. Persons being deported may be sent to countries other than their countries of origin.”
The lawsuit claims Homeland Security’s “lack of transparency and procedural safeguards created chaos within educational institutions and upended the lives of lawful F-1 visa holders.”
The lawsuit emphasizes that the plaintiffs are not challenging the revocation of their F-1 student visas but are instead challenging DHS’ termination of their student status to create a “pretext for future adverse immigration actions against them.”
The terminations are without legal justification, have violated constitutional guarantees of procedural due process, violate DHS’s own regulations and policies, and are “far beyond DHS’ statutory authority,” the lawsuit claims.
The plaintiffs are represented by University of Iowa law student practitioners under the direct supervision of Katherine Melloy Goettel, clinical associate professor at the university’s College of Law.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/noemjan172025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 19:10:38.225703

Read this story in English.
Los Demócratas de Connecticut han recorrido el estado durante los últimos meses para advertir a los residentes sobre los posibles efectos devastadores de los inminentes recortes federales a Medicaid.
Medicaid es el plan de salud más grande del país y cubre a más de 70 millones de estadounidenses. Conocido como HUSKY en Connecticut, Medicaid cubre a aproximadamente un millón de personas en el estado, según el Departamento de Servicios Sociales, lo que equivale a aproximadamente el 25% de la población.
Los estados dependen en gran medida del gobierno federal para financiar el programa. La Oficina de Políticas y Gestión del estado proyecta que Connecticut gastará un total de $11.6 mil millones en Medicaid este año fiscal. El gobierno federal aportó aproximadamente $6.9 mil millones, o el 59%, de esa financiación.
Los Demócratas de todo el país están alertando de que las prioridades presupuestarias de la administración Trump amenazarán la financiación federal, crucial para Medicaid. Ambas cámaras del Congreso de EE.UU. aprobaron recientemente una medida elaborada por los Republicanos que instruye al Comité de Energía y Comercio de la Cámara de Representantes a recortar $880 mil millones en gastos.
La resolución no ordena al Comité recortar Medicaid específicamente, y el presidente Donald J. Trump ha insistido en que su administración no recortará el programa. Sin embargo, según el gasto que maneja el Comité, es probable que Medicaid deba formar parte de la ecuación, lo que podría resultar en reducciones en el acceso para los afiliados.
Esto es lo que necesita saber.
¿Qué implicarán los recortes para los proveedores y los pacientes?
Medicaid cubre todo tipo de servicios para sus afiliados, incluyendo servicios médicos y de salud conductual, tratamiento por abuso de sustancias, así como atención domiciliaria y en residencias de ancianos para personas mayores y personas con discapacidad. Es poco probable que se conozcan todos los detalles de cómo se implementarán los recortes a Medicaid hasta el verano, cuando se espera que el Congreso vote el presupuesto final para el año fiscal 2026.
“Hay todo tipo de rumores circulando sobre cómo implementarían [los recortes]. Todas son malas”, declaró el Representante Estadounidense Joe Courtney, Demócrata por el Segundo Distrito, durante una conferencia de prensa en Hartford a principios de este mes.
Los proveedores ya se están preparando para los cambios, advirtiendo que podrían tener que reducir sus servicios si se aprueban los recortes.
Glenn Connan, director financiero del Consejo sobre Alcoholismo del Medio Oeste de Connecticut, un proveedor de tratamiento por el abuso de sustancias en Danbury, expresó su preocupación por que su organización tenga que cerrar algunas de sus clínicas, a pesar del aumento de la demanda de servicios.
“Si hay más recortes a Medicaid, tendremos que empezar a cerrar algunas de esas siete clínicas ambulatorias y solo tener quizás tres”, declaró Connan a los funcionarios electos durante un evento a principios de este mes en Danbury, centrado en posibles recortes a Medicaid. “Eso perjudicará a la gente de esas comunidades”. 
Jeffrey Shenberger, jefe de la división de neonatología del Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, afirmó que los recortes a Medicaid afectarían a algunos de sus pacientes más vulnerables: los bebés en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos Neonatales (NICU).
“Los recortes implicarían una reducción de recursos en el proceso de atención aguda en la NICU. Y afectarían a todas las familias y a todos los niños, independientemente de si pagan de forma privada, por cuenta propia o a través de Medicaid”, declaró Shenberger a los asistentes durante una conferencia de prensa celebrada en abril en el Connecticut Children’s Medical Center de Hartford.
Medicaid cubre aproximadamente el 40% de los nacimientos en Connecticut, según la organización de políticas sanitarias Kaiser Family Foundation.
¿Cómo afectarían los recortes a Medicaid a las finanzas estatales?
La administración del Gobernador Ned Lamont está analizando las implicaciones de los recortes a Medicaid para el presupuesto estatal. Si bien no está claro cómo recortaría el gasto el gobierno federal, el impacto de todos los recortes que el Congreso está considerando supondría una enorme presión para las finanzas estatales.
Actualmente, el gobierno federal cubre al menos el 50% de todos los costos de Medicaid del estado. Sin embargo, el Congreso podría optar por ofrecer una cantidad fija por cada afiliado a Medicaid, independientemente de cuántos o qué tipo de servicios utilice. En este escenario, Connecticut perdería 1,350 millones de dólares en los próximos siete años, o un promedio de 193 millones de dólares al año, según el Departamento de Servicios Sociales.
El gobierno federal también podría reducir o abandonar la garantía actual de que Washington reembolse al menos el 50% de los costos de Medicaid de todos los estados. En ese caso, Connecticut podría perder hasta la asombrosa cifra de 3,500 millones de dólares en reembolsos federales, según estimaciones del Departamento de Servicios Sociales. Esta financiación representa poco más de la mitad de los reembolsos federales proyectados que Connecticut recibió este año fiscal.
Las autoridades han dicho que es demasiado pronto para centrarse en cómo el estado podría recortar Medicaid en un escenario desastroso. Sin embargo, Connecticut ofrece beneficios que no son obligatorios para que los estados participen en Medicaid. Estos incluyen cobertura dental y farmacéutica, y atención domiciliaria para pacientes mayores.
La Senadora Cathy Osten, Demócrata por Sprague, copresidenta del Comité de Asignaciones de la Asamblea General, declaró al Connecticut Mirror que no está dispuesta a aceptar ningún recorte.
“No estamos presuponiendo… en un programa tan importante como Medicaid”, dijo Osten. “No vamos a empezar a considerar recortes a programas que mantienen vivas a las personas, y eso es lo que hace Medicaid”.

Kay Ivey signed a bill Thursday increasing access to Medicaid coverage for expectant mothers in Alabama.
SB 102, sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, would provide “presumptive eligibility” for pregnant women by allowing health care providers to determine eligibility for Medicaid based on preliminary information. The process is aimed at expediting access to prenatal care by allowing eligible women to receive Medicaid coverage and necessary medical services within the first trimester.
A spokesperson for the governor confirmed the bill was signed Thursday but did not provide further comment.

The legislation explicitly states that a pregnant woman can only receive one 60-day presumptive eligibility period per pregnancy. The Medicaid Agency is prohibited from retroactively denying coverage during the presumptive eligibility period due to the woman’s failure to submit a formal application or a negative decision on her application.
The provider must notify the Medicaid agency within five working days of determining a woman’s presumptive eligibility. They are also required to inform the woman that she must apply to the agency for Medicaid by the end of the following month.
This legislation is set to be repealed in October 2028.
Robyn Hyden, executive director of Alabama Arise, said in a statement that the new law has the potential to “save lives and money.”
“For too long, Alabama mothers have faced needless barriers to early prenatal care – care that can mean the difference between hope and heartbreak. SB 102 will lift some of those red-tape barriers at last,” Hyden said.
A’Niya Robinson, ACLU of Alabama’s Director of Policy and Organizing, said that ACLU is “pleased with the passage of the Alabama Maternal Healthcare Act” but acknowledged that the legislation will not entirely resolve the state’s maternal and infant mortality challenges.
“While this law will not end the maternal and infant mortality crisis in Alabama, we believe that it does have the potential to save lives and lessen the burden for pregnant people to access prenatal care early in pregnancy. As part of our reproductive justice work, we will continue working on policies to make Alabama safer for those experiencing pregnancy,” Robinson said in a statement.

I know he will do the same in his new role,” Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social.Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a former U.S. senator from Florida, will step into the role of national security adviser, according to Trump.“Together, we will continue to fight tirelessly to Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” the president wrote.Strikes on Houthi rebelsWaltz’s apparent ouster from the National Security Council occurred five weeks after what became known as Signalgate.The Atlantic magazine’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed Waltz had invited him, presumably by mistake, to a group chat of high-level officials that included Vice President J.D. Vance, discussing specific plans for strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Cabinet members denied that any classified information was shared in the chat on the commercially available app Signal, prompting Goldberg to release the chat transcript that detailed specific times and locations of the military strikes ahead of their scheduled launch.In the group chat on March 15, Waltz wrote “amazing job,” minutes after missiles landed, followed by emojis for a fist, an American flag and fire, according to Goldberg, who watched the Signal group messages in real time minutes before news of U.S. bombs in Yemen became public.The New York Times has since revealed that Hegseth shared details about the same Yemen strikes in a separate Signal group chat that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer. Hegseth has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.When contacted for details surrounding Waltz’s departure from the NSC, the White House directed States Newsroom to the president’s Truth Social account.Senate confirmation votes aheadWaltz will now face hearings and votes before senators for a post that Trump originally designated for New York U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik. Stefanik withdrew from the running to remain among the House Republican ranks as insurance against the party’s razor-thin margin.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, characterized Waltz’s exit as an “abrupt dismissal” that is “further proof of the chaos and incompetence that has reigned over President Trump’s White House and national security team during his first 100 days in office.”“The stunning amount of turnover of senior staff at both the National Security Council and at the Pentagon is alarming. Purges of senior military officers, mass firings of top career officials for perceived political disloyalty and the illegal dismantling of America’s foreign policy institutions only hurts our security and signals weakness to our foes,” Shaheen, of New Hampshire, said in a statement Thursday, while calling for accountability for those sharing information on unsecured channels.Shaheen further added, “We should remember that it was Secretary Hegseth who initially shared this material and did so a second time with his family. He too must be held accountable.”",,,,2025-05-01 18:06:20.829850

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Protesters took to the streets Thursday to air their grievances with the Trump administration in a nationwide day of rallies timed to coincide with May Day, a day meant to honor the labor movement and workers’ rights.
In Trenton, one of at least a dozen protests around New Jersey, the protest signs bobbing in the blue skies addressed everything from tariffs to climate change and immigration to national parks. With less than six weeks until New Jersey’s primaries, though, it didn’t take long for protesters to coalesce around one message — vote.
Activist Michelle Marcella-Morales led the crowd in a chant of “June 10th!” to remind protesters when to go cast their primary votes.
“We are the many, they are the few. And since we’re all pretty pissed and we outnumber them, we need to replace them! Make midterms the new mandate!” she shouted. “We have one major stab at this. They want smaller government. We want stable government. New Jersey, we have to save the Constitution, our democracy, and sickly enough, it falls squarely on our shoulders to save the world.”
Rally speakers included labor leaders, a state senator and activists, and drew a crowd that packed the plaza across from the Statehouse.
Lisa Saladino of Parsippany showed up dressed in a Ruth Bader Ginsberg collar and robe. She lamented the Trump administration’s recent attacks on judges, as well as President Donald Trump’s right-leaning judicial appointees.
“She was someone who fought for our rights, and we need more people like her in the Supreme Court,” Saladino said of the late, liberal U.S. Supreme Court justice. “We need the Supreme Court to remember they’re here for us and to uphold the Constitution. We are all going to lose our rights, and I just can’t sit back and watch it happen.”
State Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex) stopped by the protest after the Senate’s budget and appropriations committee, on which he serves, heard testimony about higher education funding in New Jersey. He warned the crowd that Trump and Elon Musk, Trump’s billionaire friend who’s overseeing federal cost-cutting, “are doing everything they can to dismantle higher education.”
“Why? Because if you want to go after democracy, what do you do? You go after education, you go after freedom of speech, you go after freedom of expression, you go after the ability to come together and protest,” Zwicker said. “We will not stand for that, not today, not tomorrow, and not ever.”
Several more May Day protests are planned in New Jersey through the weekend.

The offer was announced by the office of Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa Thursday in partnership with the Rhode Island Association for the Education of Young Children. 
“When we talk about giving kids the best start, it’s not just about those first steps — it’s about building a future full of opportunity and support,” Diossa said in a statement. 
An account must be opened on the CollegeBound Saver website with the promo code 529Day to receive the promotion. An account takes about 10 minutes to set up, according to the website. 
CollegeBound Saver is Rhode Island’s iteration of a 529 plan, which is intended to boost families’ savings for future education costs for children or other beneficiaries. Rhode Island plan assets grow tax-deferred and withdrawals are tax free when used for higher education costs. Savings can be put toward expenses at any accredited university or college in the U.S. or abroad. They can also be used for trade and vocational schools and registered apprenticeship programs. 
Last year, Diossa’s office participated in 529 Day, the national celebration of 529 plans, and deposited $300 contributions into new CollegeBound Saver accounts through a partnership with the Rhode Island Foundation and the Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner. That promotion lasted for 24 hours and kids ages 3 through 7 were eligible.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)More than a month after losing nearly $1 million in federal funding, the University of Iowa International Writing Program is working toward a more hopeful future with outside donations and exploration of new programs, its director said.
The UI announced Thursday in a news release the writing program has received a $250,000 donation from Florida investor and lawyer Hugh Culverhouse Jr., alongside a challenge from the donor to see other supporters of the program match his gift.
“I am so very grateful to Mr. Culverhouse for giving us the chance to build a bridge to a sustainable future,” said International Writing Program Director Christopher Merrill in the release. “We look forward not only to welcoming a larger than planned cohort of distinguished poets and writers to our Fall Residency, but to exploring new ways of understanding what their role may be in our changing world.”

The program learned in February grants it received from the U.S. Department of State through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs were canceled, causing the shutdown of summer programming and cutting the size of its fall residency in half.
Merrill said in an interview the process of choosing participants for the 11-week fall residency, the program’s main offering, had already begun, and staff at the time were waiting for the State Department to send information about nominations to consulates and embassies across the globe.
This step was not completed weeks after it was supposed to be, Merrill said, giving him an inkling of what was to come.
“We could read the writing on the wall,” Merrill said.
When the news first broke, Merrill said program staff were hoping to fund, at most, 15 participants for the fall residency program. With the donation, that number has increased to as many as 25, bringing the residency back to its usual capacity.
Summer programming for international high school students is still discontinued, Merrill said. Recruiting and nominations for that program had already been completed by the time the news of funding losses came.
He hopes to keep funding an initiative that sets up program alumni as mentors for young writers in their home country. Groups set up in Ukraine and Myanmar have been successful, he said, as well as in Afghanistan, where the alum has provided “a kind of lifeline” to young women writers not allowed to go to school. Virtual programming will also continue.
If he can figure out a new way to recruit and work with the 53 UNESCO Cities of Literature, of which Iowa City is one, Merrill said he’d like to plan a symposium for program graduates and others with a focus on what the role is of literary residencies and writers during these challenging times.
“We’ve got some support from the university to give us a couple of years to figure out a way to a sustainable future, and with this gift from Mr. Culverhouse and his challenge to other supporters to try to match the gift, that gives us the breathing room to try to come up with what we hope will be a model that will survive,” Merrill said.
From the moment President Donald Trump was elected, Merrill said he knew things would get complicated with the International Writing Program, and questions started flooding in after the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, started looking for areas to cut in the U.S. government.
In speaking with U.S. officials and working to prove the program’s necessity, Merrill said it became clear to him that the program’s operations were exactly the opposite of what the Trump administration was interested in supporting. That was proven by the funding termination letter, which stated the program no longer aligned with national interests. Merrill said the news was “a bit hard to stomach,” as the partnership between the UI program and U.S. Department of State was almost 60 years old.
Another program Merrill knew of that saw cuts was Battery Dance Corporation, which at that point had purchased tickets and otherwise paid for a trip to Beijing to perform, he said. The company had received $69,000 to perform in Wuhan, China, as part of a public diplomacy program, Iowa Capital Dispatch reported.
“These are prized cultural diplomacy programs that give a different picture of the U.S. abroad, and they’re just unbelievably inexpensive to put together,” Merrill said. “But there we go, let’s just make as many enemies as we can. Seems to be the defining feature of this administration.”

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois State Police released preliminary toxicology results that showed no drugs or alcohol in the system of a driver who crashed into a central Illinois after-school program, killing four young girls.

Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said Thursday police are still investigating the cause of the crash but found one possible explanation.

“Some evidence has been developed indicating the possibility of a medical emergency leading to the crash,” Kelly said at a Springfield news conference. “However, the investigation of this information and other evidence has not yet concluded, and we will continue until all leads and research has been exhausted.”

Marianne Akers, 44, of Chatham, was the driver and only occupant of a Jeep that on Monday struck a building that housed the YNOT Camp, which stands for Youth Needing Other Things, an after-school camp in Chatham.

Those killed were Ainsley Johnson, 8; Kathryn Corley, 7; Alma Buhnerkempe, 7, all of Chatham, and counselor Rylee Britton, 18, of Springfield. All the victims died from blunt force trauma.

Six other children were injured at the scene and hospitalized. Two have since been released.

Akers was not injured in the crash and was taken to the hospital for evaluation. Kelly said she provided blood and urine specimens at that time.

He confirmed that toxicology screenings came back negative for all forms of alcohol including ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, and all substances including benzodiazepine, amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids, and phencyclidine.

The news release ISP published Tuesday said the incident did “not appear to be a targeted attack.” During the news conference Thursday, Kelly confirmed that statement.

“If you think about that terminology, a targeted attack, it implies a certain intent or some specific motive, or a link of some type, a nexus between the person, in this case, the driver, and that location,” he said. “And there's just no evidence of that that would indicate that this was something intended as some type of mass violence or terrorist attack, or something along those natures. There’s absolutely nothing to indicate that whatsoever.”

Although he would not confirm how fast Akers’ car was traveling at the time of impact, Kelly said her car covered over 1,300 feet “pre- and post-impact” — information ISP obtained using photography, drones, videos, diagrams and other information when investigating at the scene.

Kelly said ISP released Akers’ name a day after the accident because it was “already out there,” and that confirming her name did not provide any information that hadn’t already been publicly confirmed.

“We offer our sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and Chatham community during this difficult time now,” Kelly said before asking reporters gathered at the news conference to observe a moment of silence for the victims and survivors.

Chatham schools were closed through Friday.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A bill that would allow up to 15,000 K-12 students in South Carolina to receive $7,500 scholarships next year for private tuition headed to the governor’s desk Thursday after the House agreed to a compromise with the Senate.
Opponents of the bill in the Senate proposed a number of changes, none of which passed. Democrats in the House put up a final stand Thursday, even while acknowledging they didn’t have the votes to actually stop the bill.
This proved to be the case: The House sent the compromise to the governor’s desk with a vote of 73-32. No Democrats voted for it. Three Republicans voted against it.
SC House and Senate reach compromise on K-12 vouchers

Gov. Henry McMaster is expected to quickly sign the bill into law.
The issue was a top priority for Republican leadership after the state Supreme Court struck down private tuition payments last September as unconstitutional.
Private donors have been paying tuition for roughly 800 students since then.
In the coming school year, the bill would provide scholarships to up to 10,000 students whose families make up to 300% of the federal poverty level.
Eligibility would increase in 2026-2027 to 15,000 students living in households with incomes up to 500% of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that would be nearly $161,000 under 2025 guidelines.
Students who are in public school and whose families make less than 300% of the federal poverty level would get priority in receiving the scholarships through early application windows.
While the compromise doesn’t create universal school choice like the version the House passed, it does leave the door open for legislators to put more money into the program if more than 15,000 students apply.
“Providing parents with more options for educating their children is in the best interest of our students, parents and the state of South Carolina,” said House Education Chairwoman Shannon Erickson, R-Beaufort.
Ultimately, the state Supreme Court will decide if the law takes effect.
The bill is almost certain to bring another legal challenge. In a statement soon after the bill passed, the South Carolina Education Association called the bill unconstitutional. The teachers’ advocacy group filed the last lawsuit that led to last fall’s ruling.
“Diverting these funds from the many for the benefit of a few, by whatever means, undermines our public schools and threatens the quality of education that is vital for all South Carolinians,” the statement read. “Our children deserve better.”
Supporters of the bill are hopeful that drawing from a different revenue source or sending the money through a trustee hired by the state superintendent will make this version constitutional.
That combines ideas from the House, which instituted the idea of a trustee, and the Senate, which wanted to pull from state lottery revenue. The final compromise leaves it for legislators to decide whether to take the money from lottery profits or the state’s general fund.
“We listened, we learned, we took both sides of the (Supreme Court) opinion, and we sat down and wrote what we thought was the best solution,” Erickson said.
Opponents weren’t convinced.
Regardless of the specific source, the money is still public, said Rep. Kambrell Garvin. The state constitution bars public money from directly benefitting private schools.
“It’s a bad idea because it is clearly unconstitutional,” the Columbia Democrat said.
Lottery profits are primarily used to pay for scholarships to colleges — both public and private. High school graduates earning the academic-based scholarships can use them at the South Carolina college of their choice.
Supporters in the Senate argued scholarships for private K-12 schools should be legal too.
Garvin, who spent three years as a school teacher, questioned whether using lottery profits for K-12 scholarships could reduce funding available for college scholarships. That would require legislators to dip into the general fund to provide all the scholarships they qualify for by law.
“I think what will happen is that we’re going to bite off more than we can chew,” Garvin said.
Democrats saw the bill as a step toward universal school choice, which would allow every student in the state to access the money, regardless of income level. The 500% poverty level already incorporates most families in South Carolina, including parents already paying for private schools, House Democrats said.
Garvin also pointed to what opponents say is a lack of accountability over the program. Private schools don’t have the same oversight as public schools, meaning the state will have little control over the quality of education students receive once they use the money, he said.
That could lead to any number of issues for students, he said.
“We are opening Pandora’s Box,” Garvin said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0761-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 18:06:20.829850

But this year comes with a twist. In an effort to attract even more volunteers, this year’s Green Up Day will have a Kentucky Derby theme. After picking up trash, volunteers have the option to participate in a Kentucky Derby-inspired hat contest, see live music and receive food and drink deals at breweries and bars throughout the state.Green Up Vermont Executive Director Kate Alberghini said the number of cleanup participants has steadily grown since she joined the nonprofit in 2019.Despite lower turnout during the Covid-19 pandemic, Green Up Day saw a 30% increase in volunteers from 2023 to 2024, which she credits to a successful campaign the organization ran that year to beat the Guinness World Record for the most pledges to pick up trash in a 24 hour period. The annual spring cleanup tradition started on April 18, 1970 — one week before the first-ever Earth Day. Interstate highways closed from 9 a.m. to noon so more than 70,000 volunteers could pick up trash to “green up” the state.READ MORE
A group of concerned citizens banded together in 1979 to create a nonprofit based on this annual day of stewardship, and since then, the organization — now called Green Up Vermont — has led efforts to expand the reach of Green Up Day.Last year’s Green Up Day eliminated more than 404 tons of trash around Vermont, according to the organization’s website. However, Alberghini said the work extends beyond just one day. The rest of the year, Green Up Vermont works to educate Vermonters about waste reduction, she said. “I would like nothing more than to work myself out of a job, but the reality is that there’s too much waste,” Alberghini said.On Wednesday, students at U-32 Middle and High School gathered at Gov. Phil Scott’s weekly press conference, held on the school’s campus in partnership with Green Up Vermont, where they asked questions about this year’s Green Up Day and voiced concerns about climate change.“As a young person, I feel very uncertain about my future, and I’ve spoken with other youth who feel the same. We want to know that lawmakers are hearing the youth’s voice and doing their best to create a sustainable world for us to inherit,” said Ella Thomas, an 11th grader at U-32 and winner of this year’s Green Up Day poster contest.Gov.

He said Vermont’s climate policy is too aggressive and creates conflict.“What we need to do is bring everybody along because I believe climate change is real,” he said. “We have to address it, but we all need to be on the same page.”Scott pointed to Green Up Day as an opportunity to engage in a community effort to reduce waste, emphasizing the importance of Green Up Day to the state’s environmentally conscious culture.“Green Up Day just naturally fits into our tradition,” Scott said. “It’s the way we’re built, and I think it’s a great example of what Vermont’s all about.”To volunteer this Saturday, Vermonters can visit the Green Up Vermont website to find their town’s event details.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Green Up Day celebrates 55 years in Vermont.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picking-Up-Trash-Green-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 18:06:20.829850

Green International Airport on Nov. 1, 2024, between 5:01 and 5:35 a.m. (Courtesy photo from the Rhode Island Airport Corporation)State airport officials claim the wait for passengers to get through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport is taking too long, and they might have a solution: Replace the federal officers with private security workers.
The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) filed a petition on April 25 to join the TSA’s Screening Partnership Program, which allows use of private screening contractors for airport security. Airport spokesperson Bill Fischer confirmed the application after the move was first reported by WPRI-12 Tuesday.
A copy of the petition was not immediately made available.
Fischer said the recommendation came from Virginia-based consultant Studdiford Technical Solutions after RIAC hired the firm last November to analyze increasing passenger numbers and “unusually long checkpoint lines” officials noticed the month prior.
“We have in fact seen unacceptable and increased lines and wait times that have become a concern for the board and management team,” Fischer said in a statement. “In anticipation of sustained higher passenger volumes, we feel it is important to evaluate every option.”
Fischer said airport officials are only exploring the option and have not made any final decision on the matter. Even if the TSA were to approve the petition, Fischer said the federal agency would retain oversight and continue to set security standards at T.F. Green.
‘That’s not a reason to privatize’
The head of the union representing New England’s TSA officers called RIAC’s justification for pursuing the possibility of privatizing screening “ridiculous.”
“That’s not a reason to privatize,” Mike Gayzagian, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2617 headquartered in Boston, said in an interview. “Wait times are fluid.”
Since the start of 2025, TSA spokesperson Daniel Velez said 100% of all standard lane screenings at T.F. Green remained under the agency’s projected peak wait of half an hour. 
The longest wait time in the last month was at 27 minutes, according to TSA data obtained by Rhode Island Current. The average maximum wait travelers experienced in April was 10 minutes. Travelers who used TSA Precheck had an average maximum wait time of five minutes last month.
The average wait time nationally is just over four-and-a-half minutes and a little more than two minutes for those who’ve pre-checked. 
TSA tracks the data by handing a yellow card to the last passenger in line at the top, middle and bottom of the hour. Those passengers hold the card until they get up to an airport’s X-ray, Velez explained in an email Thursday. An officer will then add all of the time up and average out the wait time for that hour.
Federal officers may also use closed-circuit television to track how long passengers wait to be screened.
Velez said travels may see long wait times due to rescheduled flights or staffing shortages. T.F. Green has roughly TSA 170 officers, but Velez declined to state how many vacancies there are citing security reasons.
“We work closely with our airport and airline partners to be able to project the busiest times of the day and make sure we are prepared,” Velez said in an emailed statement.
Fischer acknowledged TSA has worked out some of the performance issues and that wait times in April have improved quite significantly. 
“We will continue to monitor this situation and make recommendations that are in the best interest of our passengers,” he said in an email.

Objections from congressional delegates
So far, half of Rhode Island’s congressional delegation has expressed opposition to RIAC’s privatization proposal.
U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner, whose congressional district includes the Warwick airport, said he has concerns about shifting duties away from the TSA.
“Privatizing security services at T.F. Green is not in the best interest of Rhode Island travelers or local workers who keep the airport safe and running smoothly,” Magaziner said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “As a frequent traveler at T.F. Green I see no apparent need to make such a change.” 
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said  privatizing TSA duties could undermine safety and staffing at T.F. Green.
“We are fortunate to have a great airport, but the idea of privatization strikes me as the wrong approach,” he said in a statement. “I worked to ensure the airport got technology upgrades to make the security process more efficient and I also provide oversight to ensure TSA is accountable and reimburses the airport as needed.”
The TSA has 60 days to review RIAC’s petition to privatize screening duties. If approved, Fischer said existing transportation security officers would have the option to apply to be a screener under whatever private security firm airport officials would contract.
But Gayzagian said going private can come with a lesser salary and fewer benefits. TSA officers can make between $65,000 and $70,000 a year with a benefits package of health, dental and vision, and life insurance.
“Who do they expect to come to take those jobs?” Gayzagian said.
Gayzagian also claimed that privatized officers would have fewer worker protections compared to their federal counterparts.Fischer said that contracted screeners at other airports that have chosen to privatize TSA duties have unionized. 
Sure, worker organization is possible, Gayzagian said. 
“They’d have to start from scratch,” he added.
5% of U.S. commercial airports in program
TSA screens passengers at more than 430 federalized, commercial airports nationwide. Twenty-one airports, including Kansas City, Orlando and San Francisco have opted into the TSA Screening Partnership Program. The only New England airport participating is Portsmouth International Airport in New Hampshire, which joined in 2014.
TSA officers continue to run checkpoints at Bradley International Airport in Connecticut and Boston Logan International Airport, where Massport spokesperson Benjamin Crawley said there are no intentions at this time to privatize.
“We have a great relationship with our TSA partners,” Crawley said in an email. 
RIAC’s decision to explore privatization comes after rumors that airport officials sought to privatize its police force rather than hire sworn officers. Airport officials signed a five-year contract last October with Illinois-based Andy Frain Services for $5.5 million to provide workers who would inspect security badges, inspect vehicles entering restricted areas, and manage traffic outside the terminal. 
Fischer reiterated that RIAC has no plans to replace its police or fire departments with private contractors.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah leaders look more toward energy innovation and creating an abundance of supply, the state faces declining coal operations.
Last year there were five operational coal mines in the state, the fewest in its 150-year-old coal history, according to a new Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute research brief on Utah’s energy sector, part of the institute’s economic report to the governor. 
While the opening of the Fossil Rock mine, located in Emery County brought a slight increase in coal production — from 7 million tons in 2023, to 7.5 million tons in 2024 — the number is still well below the average of 24.5 million tons produced in the 2000s and is still 30% lower than what the state averaged two years ago.  

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
“We peaked in coal production in the late 90s, early 2000s, up to 27 million tons a year. And since then, it’s been a pretty steady decline,” Michael Vanden Berg, energy and minerals program manager at the Utah Geological Survey and author of the study said on Thursday during a media presentation of the brief. 
The state’s coal exports, both domestically and internationally, have substantially dropped. In the early 2000s, Utah sent up to 16 million tons of coal to other states. That number fell to 377,000 tons in 2024.
The outlook for coal as an electricity generator has also substantially shrank in the state’s energy portfolio. In the year 2000, it accounted for 94% of the generation mix. That number dropped to 46% in 2024, with other resources booming. 
Natural gas, for example, went from making up 2% of the mix in the year 2000 to 34% last year. Solar went from nothing to 14% in those 24 years. 
Nuclear development and electricity rates to dominate energy discussion this legislative session

Looking ahead, the future of Utah’s energy production is on a trajectory to change even more. This year, Gov. Spencer Cox and lawmakers approved a plan to set up the foundation for another big resource — nuclear.
But, with the introduction of a new resource, Utahns may have to face changes when it comes to paying their utility bills. That could mean higher prices.
Preliminary numbers indicate that Utah kept its spot as a top state with the cheapest residential electricity bills. As state leaders make an effort to attract artificial intelligence, data centers and increased electrification, Utah is also looking at how to keep its energy costs low compared to other states, Emy Lesofski, director of the Utah Office of Energy Development said on Thursday.
However, with nuclear energy carrying a hefty price tag, balancing the need for innovation while keeping rates low is a challenge. 
“One of the things about small modular reactors, which is where the state’s focusing its initial interest, is that the idea is for them to be designed to be deployed much less expensively and more quickly, which will help the upfront cost of building nuclear,” Lesofski said. 
“And then on the back end, nuclear is very affordable to run once it’s built,” she added. “And so these are difficult questions that we’re gonna have to grapple with, but we definitely know that we need more power. We need it to be reliable, we want it to be clean, and nuclear provides those things.”
Additionally, energy consumption, which includes electricity, gas and other resources, has been on a steady increase of about 1.7% per year, according to the report, so state leaders are looking at how to keep up with demand when the increased need comes in gigawatt figures.
With more local input, Legislature signs on to the beginning of Utah’s nuclear future

While coal production in Utah is at one of its lowest levels, Lesofski believes it is still crucial for the state’s energy outlook.
“I think when the power isn’t needed because there’s other sources to replace it, then that discussion (about stopping using coal) may occur,” she said. “But, we need power now. We need more now, and our coal plans provide that reliable power that we need.”
That message is in line with the Utah Legislature’s actions protecting coal and preventing what lawmakers deem to be coal plants’ early retirement. They often call it an “all of the above” approach. 
Despite its decline, coal is still in high demand in Utah, prompting imports from other states. But, that might change a bit in 2026, when the newly opened Fossil Rock mine starts its full-scale mining, adding up to 3 million tons to the mix, according to the report. 
Also, some Intermountain Power Plant coal generators will convert to natural gas, removing demand for 2 million to 3 million tons of coal — despite legislation that will keep at least one of its coal-powered units active.
Still, Utah usually produces more energy than it needs. According to the study, during 2021 and 2022, the state became a net energy importer since its production couldn’t keep up with demand. However, that “importer” designation didn’t last long. In 2023 Utah went back to being an energy exporter, a designation that expanded in 2024.

Faith Winter, a Broomfield Democrat, speaks at the Colorado Capitol last week. She sponsored a bill that would add protections for transgender people in Colorado. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)An amended version of a bill that intends to add legal protections for transgender people in Colorado passed its first vote in the Colorado Senate after eight hours of testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday evening into early Thursday. 
House Bill 25-1312, dubbed the Kelly Loving Act in honor of a transgender woman killed during the 2022 Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs, initially proposed various new legal protections for transgender people in education, family legal matters and public accommodation. Sponsors amended out a provision that concerned child custody decisions — which drew intense opposition from parental advocates — and a stripped down version of the bill passed the committee. 
The bill defines deadnaming — when someone calls a transgender person by their previous name — and misgendering as discriminatory acts in the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act. It would also shield parents who help their child obtain gender-affirming care from laws in other states that outlaw the practice. The amended version removed references to “chosen” names in a section requiring school policies be “inclusive of all reasons” that a student changes their name, and it removed language around gender in the section that says schools must allow students to choose from any variation contained in dress code policies.

The committee removed a section of the bill that would have made judges in child custody cases consider deadnaming, misgendering or threatening to publish information related to an individual or child’s gender-affirming care as a form of “coercive control” in custody proceedings. Much of the testimony against the bill focused on that section, with many witnesses sharing concerns about the government involving itself in family matters. Sen. Dylan Roberts, a Frisco Democrat on the committee, said 95% to 99% of the concerns he heard related to the cut section. 
“If Section 2 were still in the bill, I would have been opposed. I think it was an intrusion into the parent-child relationship that would have had some negative consequences,” Roberts said. “And while I understand the intent maybe of the original inclusion, I think the policy implications were challenging at best.”
The committee voted 5-2 to move the bill forward along party lines, with Democrats in support and Republicans against it. Some committee members who voted in support of the bill said they still want to see more changes to reflect concerns from certain LGBTQ+ groups and around the shield law provision of the bill, but they said the amended version was better than how the bill started. 
“I think they’re bringing up some valid legal concerns, not questioning their support for trans Coloradans,” Roberts said. “ I think they’re bringing up valid legal concerns about the firmness of what’s on the paper here if it were to get challenged all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.”
Hundreds testify
One Colorado, one of the largest LGBTQ+ advocacy groups in Colorado, initially supported the legislation but has changed course and has since taken an “amend” position on the bill with concerns that it could jeopardize current protections. After it passed the House with Democratic support, it stalled in the Senate as stakeholder conversations continued. One Colorado has not shared any details on what it wants to see change in the bill, and nobody with the organization testified at the bill hearing. 
“One Colorado is not testifying today because we want to continue our work with the proponents of this bill and community to make it stronger,” One Colorado spokesperson Cal Solverson said in a statement. 
Legislative staff said 726 people signed up to testify on the measure. Committee leadership limited debate to eight hours, four in favor of the bill and four against the bill, and asked those still in the room after witness testimony ended to stand to show if they were for, against, or seeking amendments on the bill. 










Does this bill do enough? No, and honestly legislation never will, but it does something ... It gives trans folks harmed across the state more access to legal protections than we have today.


– Anaya Robinson, senior policy strategist with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado


Those in support of the bill said it will save transgender peoples’ lives and make them safer. 
Anaya Robinson, senior policy strategist with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, said his organization has had concerns with how the bill could be challenged at the federal level, but continued engagement with bill sponsors and stakeholders have led to changes addressing concerns as they come up. As a trans man, Robinson said his community needs “robust and clear protections that do not rely on federal law,” and the bill is a step in the right direction.
“Does this bill do enough? No, and honestly legislation never will, but it does something,” Robinson said. “It gives trans folks harmed across the state more access to legal protections than we have today, and in a time where our literal existence is being questioned, our history being erased, the legality of our bodies and our autonomy is being decided by people who do not believe we have a right to live, we need our elected officials and our community organizations to step up and do something.” 
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has issued orders to recognize only two unchangeable genders, stop offering non-binary passport gender markers, and attempted to stop funding care for transgender people under age 19.
Sybil Vane, a transgender woman from Brighton, described herself as an ordinary person who has led “a typical American life,” and she said “none of that has changed since I transitioned.” She said despite this, transgender people are not afforded the same respect as others.  
“I hope that the members of the committee and all those in opposition to the Kelly Loving Act can see me not as transgender, but as a fellow American, deserving the same dignity we afford to all,” Vane said. “Until such a day comes when we can see each other as humans first and transgender second, we need the Kelly Loving Act.”
The bill is sponsored by Rep. Lorena García, an Adams County Democrat, Rep. Rebekah Stewart, a Lakewood Democrat, Sen. Faith Winter, a Westminster Democrat, and Sen. Chris Kolker, a Littleton Democrat.
First Amendment objections
The committee voted to strike a portion of the bill that said Colorado courts “shall not give any force or effect” to laws in other states connected to taking children away from parents or caregivers who allowed the child access to gender-affirming care. Winter said that change reflects concerns around the Constitution’s full faith and credit clause and respecting laws of other states. But the shield provision retains other language that protects people in Colorado from other states’ gender-affirming care restrictions.
The amendment also clarified how a court should consider intentional, persistent deadnaming or misgendering as evidence of someone discriminating based on gender identity or expression, and it removed a provision around deadnaming and misgendering in a place of public accommodation. 
“The language around this is not if you call someone the wrong name by accident,” Winter said. “This isn’t if someone shows up at your workplace and you call them the wrong name or misgender them. There has to be intentionality to cause harm, and so this is about the action to the individual and not just speech.”
New additions to the bill include a provision that says someone does not need a court order if they want to change their gender marker on the driver’s license or identification a second or third time. Winter said Colorado allows an “X” gender marker on state IDs, but that has led to some people having trouble with student loans and passport applications, so some people may want to change their gender markers back. 
The bill now makes it so that a county clerk can issue a new marriage license to someone who has legally changed their name. 
Many who testified against the bill showed skepticism of gender-affirming care and denied that people can be transgender. Others questioned whether provisions of the bill would constitute compelled speech and violate the First Amendment.  
Wayne Williams, a former Republican secretary of state and attorney in Colorado Springs, expressed concerns with the shield law provisions of the bill and said it can create a “coercive” situation if states “do not give authority to the laws of others.” 
“There are a number of issues remaining in the bill that need to be fixed before it could be passed, and it should therefore be killed,” Williams said.
Sen. John Carson, a Highlands Ranch Republican on the committee, said “it’s pretty clear” that Colorado already has the laws it needs to prohibit discrimination.
“Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, extending protections beyond federal law, protects individuals from discrimination based on disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, religion, age, national origin and ancestry,” Carson said. “My belief is when we have adequate laws, we should focus on enforcing those.” 
The bill will go through the Senate Appropriations Committee before it will be up for debate on the Senate floor. The House will have to approve Senate amendments to the bill before it could be signed into law.
Democrats control strong majorities in both chambers of the Legislature.
The 2025 legislative session ends on May 7.

SPRINGFIELD – Nine Illinois police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2024 were honored at a ceremony in Springfield Thursday.

The Illinois Peace Officers Memorial takes place every year on the first Thursday of May to honor officers who died on the job in the prior year. Families of the officers are given a plaque honoring their family member’s service by the state’s constitutional elected officials and the officers’ names are inscribed on a memorial outside the Illinois Capitol.

“They woke up every single day knowing that they may be called on to face extreme uncertainty, that on a moment’s notice, they may be required to put themselves in harm’s way to save another,” Gov. JB Pritzker said.

This year’s event honored DeKalb County Deputy Sheriff Christina Musil, Department of Corrections Sgt. Andrew Faught, Chicago Police Officer Luis Huesca, Cook County Corrections Deputy Sheriff Rafael Wordlaw, Chicago Police Officer James Crowley, Illinois State Police Trooper Corey Thompsen, Chicago Police Officer Enrique Martinez, Oak Park Detective Allan Reddins and ISP Trooper Clay Carns.

This year’s event also honored K-9s for the first time, including K-9 officers that died in the line of duty from Rockford, Lake County and Alton last year.

“The families that we induct today never asked to be a part of this somber club,” Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said.

Treasurer Mike Frerichs also gave an emotional speech honoring his cousin, a California police officer who recently died. Frerichs’ office provides a college scholarship fund for children of first responders who died on the job.

Former ISP Trooper Kim Cessna, who leads a nonprofit for family members of fallen police officers, gave a personal remembrance of her colleague Thompsen, who was killed in a crash last October.

“We take these memories with us, allowing them to guide us, reminding us the beauty they brought into our lives,” Cessna said. “We carry their love in our hearts, and we let that love become a source of strength.”

Kathleen Rittmanic-Emme, the sister of Bradley Police Officer Marlene Rittmanic who died in 2021, described the emotional toll that court cases take on families following an officer’s death.

“Four years of hell to get what you call justice is absolutely heart-wrenching and ridiculous,” said Rittmanic-Emme.

Rittmanic’s killer was sentenced in January to life in prison.

Martinez’s death was on Comptroller Susana Mendoza’s mind. Martinez was shot and killed during a traffic stop last November on Chicago’s South Side by a man with an illegally modified gun, according to prosecutors.

But it was the suspect’s criminal history that Mendoza said bothered her the most. Block Club Chicago reported the man was on electronic monitoring when he killed Martinez and had multiple prior convictions, including battery, fleeing the police and aggravated discharge of a firearm. He was also awaiting trial on drug charges at the time of the murder.

“Chicago Police Officer Enrique Martinez would be with us right now and not on this button or the memorial wall outside if the monster that murdered him was locked up instead of out committing crimes while out on electronic monitoring,” Mendoza said.

Mendoza, a Chicago Democrat and sister of a Chicago Police officer, blasted portions of the SAFE-T Act – a 2021 police reform law championed by Democrats after Geroge Floyd's murder in 2020. She said as an elected official, she needs to do more to speak out against policies she believes jeopardize officer safety.

Mendoza called on lawmakers to remove a provision in state law that requires people on home confinement with or without electronic monitoring to be given two days of movement.

“When we give more rights to the criminals than we do to our police officers, we end up with dead officers and increased crime in our communities,” Mendoza said, earning applause from the officers and families in attendance.

,DC,2025-05-01 21:18:25+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Senate Dems seek Trump administration report on human rights in El Salvador prison,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-seek-trump-administration-report-human-rights-el-salvador-prison,,"WASHINGTON — Kilmar Abrego Garcia remains in prison in El Salvador after he was mistakenly deported more than a month ago, and Senate Democrats said Thursday they will file a privileged resolution that would require the State Department to report on human rights conditions in CECOT,  the brutal 40,000-capacity facility where Abrego Garcia was first incarcerated.The resolution also would force the Trump administration to detail its steps to comply with court orders on the removal of Abrego Garcia and other immigrants from the United States.The announcement of the resolution came after President Donald Trump, during an ABC News interview that aired Tuesday, acknowledged that if he wanted to, he could secure the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.However, Trump then refused to do so, alleging Abrego Garcia has gang ties. He pointed to an altered photograph of Abrego Garcia’s knuckles that showed them displaying the characters “MS-13.”When ABC News journalist Terry Moran pointed out the photo was photoshopped, Trump argued that it wasn’t.“Why don't you just say, ‘Yes, he does,’” Trump said to Moran, referring to the MS-13 tattoo. Moran did not reply and moved to another topic.The Department of Justice has claimed that Abrego Garcia is a leader in the MS-13 gang, but has not provided evidence in court of those connections. Abrego Garcia was granted deportation protections by an immigration judge in 2019 over concerns he would experience violence by gangs if returned to his home country of El Salvador.The U.S. Supreme Court, an appeals court and a district court all have upheld that Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly deported to a notorious prison, must be returned.“Donald Trump should stop trampling on constitutional rights of people who reside in America, and the government of El Salvador should stop conspiring with the Trump administration to violate the constitutional rights of those who reside in America, including Abrego Garcia,” Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen said at a press conference on the Senate resolution.The Supreme Court last month ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia, but stopped short of requiring it and sent the case back to a federal judge to clarify how the return could be “effectuated.”The case is now in closed proceedings before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland as discovery and depositions from officials interviewed under oath about Abrego Garcia’s case continue. Xinis on Wednesday denied the Trump administration’s request for another extension to provide information on Abrego Garcia.$6 million payment The resolution, backed by Van Hollen, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, would require the State Department to issue a human rights report on El Salvador.It also specifically asks for a report on the prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, where Abrego Garcia was initially sent in March, along with nearly 300 other men deported from the U.S.The State Department issued a 2023 report on human rights conditions in El Salvador, which noted that there were reports of “systemic abuse in the prison system, including beatings by guards and the use of electric shocks.”If the resolution manages to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate and House, and the State Department doesn’t issue a human rights report within 30 days, then any foreign assistance to El Salvador would be canceled, Kaine said.The Trump administration has stated that it’s paying El Salvador $6 million to detain the men at CECOT.Van Hollen said of that funding, the Trump administration has paid El Salvador about $4 million so far to detain the men and plans to pay as much as $15 million.Experts have raised concerns that the foreign assistance funds to El Salvador from the State Department violate the Leahy Law, which bars financial support of “units of foreign security forces” — which can include military and law enforcement staff in prisons —  facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations.Van Hollen meeting in El SalvadorVan Hollen also pushed back on the Trump administration’s insistence that because Abrego Garcia is in El Salvador’s custody, he cannot be returned.Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador last month seeking a meeting with Abrego Garcia, said during that trip he spoke with El Salvador Vice President Félix Augusto Antonio Ulloa. Van Hollen said Ulloa told him “the only reason the government of El Salvador is holding (Abrego Garcia) is because the Trump administration is paying (El Salvador) to do so.”Van Hollen was initially denied a visit with Abrego Garcia. But he was eventually able to secure an in-person meeting under the close supervision of Salvadoran officials.Abrego Garcia appeared with Van Hollen in civilian clothes — a stark difference from a video released by the Trump administration that showed Abrego Garcia in a prison uniform and being roughly handled by Salvadoran officials.In response to the in-person meeting, the White House wrote on its official social media account that Abrego Garcia “is NOT coming back.”Van Hollen said he has not had any update on the condition of Abrego Garcia since the visit to El Salvador.Message for BukeleDuring El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s first-ever visit to the Oval Office in April, he declined to return Abrego Garcia. In that same meeting, Trump asked Bukele if he would take “homegrown” criminals, meaning U.S. citizens.Kaine said that he had a message for the president of El Salvador if he accepts U.S. citizens for incarceration.“You might think it's cute right now to grab attention by a bromance with President Trump,” he said, adding in Spanish that any alliance with Trump will be short-lived, ending with the conclusion of his term in office. “If you think we'll forget you violating the human rights of American citizens, you're wrong,” said Kaine.Van Hollen added that he, along with Kaine and Schumer, plan to introduce a bill to place sanctions against Bukele and “all those who are part of his government conspiring with Donald Trump to deprive residents of the United States of their constitutional rights.”",,,,2025-05-01 18:06:20.829850

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Republican lawmakers are trying again to pass a ban on Medicaid funding going to gender-affirming care for transgender Iowans, this time by including language in the proposed budget for health and human services programs.
A Senate subcommittee advanced Senate Study Bill 1237 Wednesday, the HHS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2026. The measure included language that the funding allocated for Iowa’s Medicaid program “shall not be used for sex reassignment surgery or treatment related to an individual’s gender dysphoria diagnosis.”
Iowa has attempted to ban Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care law before, but these laws were struck down by the courts for violating the Iowa Constitution and the Iowa Civil Rights Act. The Iowa Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the state’s denial of two transgender women’s transition-related care through Medicaid violated the Iowa Civil Rights Act. A Polk County District Court judge also ruled in 2021 that a law passed after that state Supreme Court decision, which amended the Iowa Civil Rights Act to allow for the exclusion of Medicaid coverage for transition-related health care,  violated the Iowa Constitution.
Earlier this year, Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law a measure that removed gender identity as a protected class in the Iowa Civil Rights Act. As activists rallied against the measure for potentially allowing for the legal discrimination against transgender Iowans, one of the arguments posed by lawmakers was the fact that previous laws attempting to deny Medicaid coverage for transition-related health care were blocked through the state Civil Rights Act.
Keenan Crow, policy and advocacy director at One Iowa, said Thursday that one of the major differences between the language in this year’s Senate appropriations bill and previous attempts to ban Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care was the reference to all “treatment related to an individual’s gender dysphoria diagnosis,” not just sex reassignment surgery. This could impact transgender Iowans’ ability to access mental health care and other services, Crow said.
“Our first line of intervention on any gender dysphoria case is going to be mental health counseling, period, that is the primary treatment for gender dysphoria,” Crow said. “And obviously I am not okay with restricting surgical care either, but to go even further and and get into restricting medications and mental health supports and all this other stuff, that is truly wrong.”
Even with the removal of gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act, denying transgender Iowans gender-affirming care could still be unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. The 2021 district court ruling found the law prohibiting Medicaid coverage of transition care violated both state civil rights laws and the state constitution. The Iowa Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the law in 2023.
House bill does not include Medicaid restriction, for now
The House Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee met Thursday to discuss its version of the HHS budget bill, House Study Bill 342, which passed unanimously. The House legislation, in its current form, does not include the Senate’s language.
But House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters Thursday that the House supports restricting Medicaid funds going toward transition-related health care.
“We don’t believe the taxpayers … should be paying for surgeries and other hormone therapies,” Grassley said. “I know that there’s a piece of that that’s in the Senate bill, I think you will see a piece focused on those two things that I just said on our side. But again, we have not negotiated the Senate language out with them. They may have some different languages where we may settle, but I think you could expect to us to, at least, have that conversation about the taxpayer paying for those two items.”
The chair of the House HHS appropriations subcommittee Rep. Ann Meyer, R-Fort Dodge, said she has spoken with Grassley about the provision, and that there will be discussions with the full House Republican caucus. However, she said that the House would likely consider different language on the measure that would not impact Medicaid coverage for mental and behavioral health care for transgender Iowans.
“If this were to come before the House, we would just be talking about surgery and hormone therapy,” Meyer said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/transprotest2.24.25.2-scaled-e1740421311729-1024x611.jpg,,,2025-05-01 18:06:20.829850

Kansas State University has the only lab out of 17 that survived USAID funding cuts. Here, KSU was part of a conference in Senegal that addressed water accessibility. (Submitted photo)TOPEKA — The Trump administration defunded 16 of 17 Feed the Future labs across the country when it began wiping out U.S. Agency for International Development projects.
After months in limbo, Kansas State University found out its lab is the lone survivor.
Two K-State labs that are part of the Feed the Future network received stop work orders in January. In early April, K-State officials received notice that the Climate Resilient Cereals Innovation Lab could resume work, said Timothy J. Dalton, professor of agricultural economics and interim director of the lab.
The second lab, the Feed the Future Collaborative Research on Sustainable Intensification  Innovation Lab, which had a $50 million cooperative agreement for its operations, was terminated.
Dalton is unsure what the future funding will be for the Cereals lab. The original cooperative agreement allocated $22 million for five years.
“We are just completing our second year,” he said. “We receive our funding in annual increments. We’ll see what happens once this fiscal year ends.”
Dalton is pleased to continue the work the Cereals lab began, which involves collaborations with universities around the country, and with national agricultural research systems in Senegal, Ethiopia and Bangladesh.
But he’s concerned about the long-term impacts of ending 16 labs, each of which was doing work that affects farmers in the United States.
University spokeswoman Michelle Geering said U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran was helpful in getting the funding reinstated.
“K-State’s innovation lab is helping bolster American agriculture by creating crops that are resistant to drought and disease,” Moran said in a press release. “I appreciate (U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio) for recognizing the importance of the work being done at Kansas State University and supporting the continuation of this program.”
 International and local impacts

The research work at all the labs has implications internationally as well as for U.S. agriculture. Giving credit to another professor, Dalton borrowed an analogy to describe what the 17 Feed the Future labs were designed to do.
“We train our military to go and fight battles overseas in order to prevent similar problems from occurring in the United States,” Dalton said. “It’s a similar argument. What we’re doing with the Innovation lab mechanism is working on very similar problems that just happen to be food-related.”
Dalton said aligning with other countries to solve agriculture challenges like crop disease resistance pays off for the United States by preparing U.S. farmers for when those same issues come here, which they eventually do, he said.
For example, research in the 1980s to protect farms in southern Africa from the sugarcane aphid helped U.S. farmers with managing the greenbug aphid, Dalton said.
“I have always expressed my deepest concern about the halting of any international collaborative work, that it’s really going to fall on the shoulders of farmers because they’re the ones who are not getting the type of research to get out in front of these challenges that they will face,” Dalton said.
 Longterm research

Dalton also raised concerns that halting support for the other 16 labs sets agricultural research back because of the long-term, slow path that research sometimes takes.
Researchers are usually tied to the crop cycles, so they may only be able to do investigations in the fields during certain times.
“The work in Ethiopia has had tremendous impacts, but it started half a century ago,” he said. “Because ag research moves slowly and it’s all about persistence over time, rather than stop-and-go funding, you have to think about protecting the long-run interests.”
 Cereals research

Work will now continue in the Climate Resilient Cereals Lab, where they focus on researching four cereal grains: sorghum, millet, wheat and rice.
In Senegal, research is focused on wheat and sorghum. It’s on the border of the Sahara Desert, Dalton said, where it’s always hot and dry, allowing them to study wheat that is exposed to heat and drought. Those are two issues that regularly affect Kansas farmers.
Work studying rice in Bangladesh considers, among other things, the genes that rice varieties harbor that are resistant to disease. Identifying ways to fight rice blast, a fungal infection that destroys rice crops around the world, is part of that research.
Dalton said sorghum research is important because there are fewer researchers focused on it than on other grains. More than 50% of U.S. sorghum is grown in Kansas.
“There are so many more questions left to be answered about sorghum because it hasn’t had that intense level of research,” he said.

CT lawmakers try again on climate legislation,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/01/net-zero-2050-ct-house-bill/,"A plan to set CT on a course to net zero carbon emissions was approved by lawmakers Thursday, giving hope to advocates.","A plan to set Connecticut on a course toward achieving net zero carbon emissions throughout the economy by 2050 was approved by House lawmakers on Thursday, giving hope to climate advocates for one of their top legislative priorities.
The legislation, House Bill 5004, would strengthen the state’s existing carbon-reduction goals and create a new “Clean Economy Council” to develop strategies and policies to help meet those targets. In addition, it offers a variety of incentives and programs for solar canopies, energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, heat pumps, green jobs and sustainability-focused businesses. 
“It’s where to we need to get to and how are we going to get there,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, co-chair of the Environment Committee and one of the bill’s architects. “Let’s put these plans in place, think about funding, think about the process [moving] forward, but do it in a reasonable and responsible way.”

Under current law, Connecticut has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% between 2001 and 2050. As preliminary step toward meeting that goal, lawmakers enacted a plan three years ago to obtain all of the state’s power needs from carbon-free sources by 2040.
H.B. 5004 would go a step further, setting a “net zero” emissions goal by the midpoint of this century. Net zero refers a point when any emissions are offset by efforts to remove those gases from the atmosphere, either through carbon-capture technology or more natural means such as planting forests and grasslands.
Many scientists and advocates say achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is necessary to prevent the global temperatures from rising to dangerous levels.
Republicans in the House criticized H.B. 5004, however, raising skepticism over the science behind climate change and inquiring about the feasibility of such a goal. Several pointed out that Connecticut has consistently lagged behind meeting its existing emissions targets, despite years of efforts.
“At times, I wonder whenever we put these bills out if we actually are trying to achieve something rather than put words in books,” said Rep. Tim Ackert, R-Coventry.
House Democrats succeeded in passing legislation very similar to H.B. 5004 last year — it even had the same bill number — only watch it fall victim to a Republican filibuster on the last day of the legislative session.
To avoid a similar fate this session, proponents say they’re giving the Senate plenty of time to consider the bill before the legislature adjourns on June 4.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, told reporters Thursday that “there was a lot of finger pointing and blame and conspiracy theories,” after the failure of H.B. 5004 last year.
“I like nothing more than to prove people wrong,” Ritter added. “They said, ‘You guys didn’t really want to do the bill, you didn’t really want to do an environmental bill.’ It’s back, May 1, six weeks to go we’re setting it up.” 
In order to ease opposition to the bill, Parker said that several sections dealing mostly with a study of natural gas usage and other energy topics were removed ahead of Thursday’s debate.
Additionally, this year’s version of the bill excluded language declaring a “climate crisis,” that was a centerpiece of last year’s legislation. While the “crisis” outlined in that bill would not have granted the governor emergency powers as in other natural disasters, it became the subject of intense debate.
“It was just such a flashpoint for opponents making a big fuss about it,” said Lori Brown,  the executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters. “But it didn’t really do anything, and it was one of those things that got left behind.” 
Parker, the bill sponsor, said some of the energy-related provisions that were removed from the bill could end up being included in separate legislation being drafted by the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee to address electric prices. Still, critics of the bill raised concerns that some of the incentives for technologies like electric heat pumps would add further demand onto the grid, raising prices even higher.
“There are a lot of initiatives in this bill that are high drains on electricity,” said Rep. Patrick Callahan, R-New Fairfield, a ranking Republican on the Environment Committee. “What’s missing is where we get our baseline power from.”
Parker responded that the purpose of the Clean Economy Council, which the bill would establish, is to develop strategies for advancing clean energy in a way that is not harmful to the state’s economy.
After more than three hours of debate, the House passed the bill late Thursday afternoon by a party-line vote of 98 to 47. 
It now heads to the Senate. Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said Senate Democrats had yet to begin discussions regarding the legislation, which he acknowledged was a “priority” for the House.
“We’ll certainly caucus it and give it the same deference the House gives to Senate priority bills,” Duff said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221221_PowerPlant__Bridgeport_YK_067.jpg,,,2025-05-01 17:11:54.508082

The Hartford rally was one of thousands happening across the U.S. to commemorate May Day, or as it is known around the world, International Workers’ Day. It was fairly focused on Connecticut and the issues coming before the General Assembly, but that same frustration was channeled at President Donald J. Trump and his first 100 days.
The overriding sentiment from many of the participants was that Connecticut needs to fill in the gaps in federal funding and potential cuts to critical services and programs. Some raised concerns that state officials may be too fiscally cautious.
“We’ve already been fighting for fair budgets and demanding that the state amend their fiscal guardrails so that we can spend money. Now with what’s happening federally, we think that those cuts are even going to be deeper, and the hole that we’ve been in — it’s just going to get bigger,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations. “We continue to demand for fully funded public services that support all of our communities.”

Thursday’s rally in Hartford was organized by three main organizations — Make the Road Connecticut, 32BJ SEIU and CT For All — that consist of various memberships across unions, immigrant rights groups and other advocacy organizations. Thousands were expected at a similar rally scheduled later Thursday in New Haven.
The groups were advocating for “just cause” eviction protections, fair wages, medical debt relief and HUSKY for immigrants, which would expand eligibility of who qualifies for Connecticut’s Medicaid program.
But even with the state-specific focus, many of the people at the rally were holding signs critical of Trump and his policies as well as calls for unity and inclusiveness.
One of those signs was Renee Hamel’s, which read, “We are here to stay.”
“The sad thing is that I got this from the first Trump presidency,” said Hamel, who works for a union that represents hospital residents. “I didn’t think I would have to be using this again. But here we are, and things are even worse, with people being under threat of deportation, people that have committed no crimes.”
For others, immigration was also a key part of the rally as the Trump administration ramps up deportations, including some targeting people who are legally allowed to be in the country. Advocates reiterated their support for Connecticut’s Trust Act, which state Republicans are pushing to roll back.
The Trust Act places limits on when state and local law enforcement can detain people who are being sought by federal immigration officials, though it makes exceptions for sharing information about an undocumented immigrant who has been convicted of a certain felony or a potential terrorist.

But the overhaul of the federal government and the changes to reliable funding streams for states had many of the rallygoers on edge. They called on Gov. Ned Lamont and other state officials to fill in some of those gaps left open by cuts to federal funding.
“I feel like our lawmakers are doing enough speaking out to push back on the agenda of the Trump administration, but when it comes to the budget, I’m so disappointed,” Hamel said.
“They are so adherent to these fiscal guardrails when we have so many programs that are being cut, and we have so much money, and it’s like if you’re not going to use it now, when are you going to use it?” she said.
May Day protests like the one on Thursday are common for groups like Make the Road CT. But they said they got even more support this time than compared to previous years.
“I think this is important because it’s not an event that only happens in Connecticut, but it’s an event that happens in other states,” Giselle Chavez, an organizer with the Make the Road CT, said. “And I think it’s important to be unified at the end of the day.”

“The Make America Healthy Again movement is not one of words, but of action!” Landry posted. “That is why today I signed an Executive Order banning soda and candy purchases from Louisiana’s food stamp program.”
Landry’s executive order doesn’t actually prohibit these purchases, as he does not have that authority.

Landry’s executive order does not define either soft drinks or candy. 
The governor also urged the Legislature to approve Senate Bill 14 by Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, a sweeping piece of nutrition legislation that, among other things, seeks a USDA waiver to prohibit the purchase of beverages with more than 5 grams of added sugar or any artificial sweetener. Drinks that include milk or milk substitutes would be exempt from this prohibition. 
When McMath presented his bill to the Senate Health and Welfare Committee this week, he said he specifically decided not to seek prohibition of candy purchases with SNAP benefits. Many Louisiana residents live in food deserts, and McMath said he did not want to prevent people who might only be able to shop at convenience stores from eating.
Landry’s order also instructs DCFS to find ways to incentivize SNAP recipients to buy produce, such as participating in the Double Up Food Bucks program. The program provides matching aid dollars for fruit and vegetable purchases in more than two dozen states. 
The order sets an Oct. 1 deadline for DCFS to submit its waiver application to the Trump administration.

Jared Polis signs Senate Bill 25-63 into law at his office in the Colorado Capitol on Thursday. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado school districts will need to adopt policies by this fall about when and why library books can be taken from the shelves under a new law signed by Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday.
The goal is to safeguard public school libraries from the growing trend that targets certain books, often about diverse topics or by diverse authors, for removal.
“Books are so important because names, experiences, identities — these things are being erased. To be able to experience how others are feeling, to learn empathy, to be able to see yourself in books if there’s no one else in your world like you — these things are so critical to developing an empathetic society,” bill sponsor Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Littleton Democrat, said ahead of the signing.

Senate Bill 25-63 requires school districts to create policies about the acquisition, retention and display of library books and other materials by September. The policy will also need to govern book challenges and consider the process for removing any books for circulation.
Only parents of students in the school district will be allowed to challenge books, and reviews of individual books will be limited to once every two years.
The bill passed the Legislature on party-line votes, with Republicans opposed to it.
“We are able to have policies in place that will reduce discriminatory censorship and ensure that the books on the shelves and the literature available to our students open their minds, allow for exploration and really foster a growth,” Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat and bill sponsor, said.
Book removal standards will need to comply with a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court case that determined school boards cannot restrict library materials simply because they disagree with their content.
In 2024, there were seven attempts to ban 137 books in public schools and libraries in Colorado, according to the American Library Association. The most challenged book in the country that year was “All Boys Aren’t Blue,” a memoir written for young adults by queer Black author George Johnson.
In Colorado, people have tried to remove books including “Beloved” by Toni Morrison, “The Kite Runner” by Khaled Hosseini and “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas. Many of the challenged books include LGBTQ+ themes, accounts of violence, and descriptions of discrimination and sexual activity. They are often by or about people of color or LGBTQ+ people.
The bill signing comes as a federal judge ordered Elizabeth School District to return 19 removed books, deemed inappropriate by the school board, back to the shelves. The law now requires school districts to follow a clear and consistent process to remove any books.
“This bill is about trusting the experience of school librarians, trusting local communities to make decisions based on the needs of their students and trusting young people to explore, wonder and to think critically,” bill sponsor Rep. Jenny Willford, a Northglenn Democrat, said.
Republicans, particularly Rep. Ken DeGraaf of Colorado Springs, argued during the legislative process that certain books are too mature for school students or contain what he deems pornographic material, and therefore should be subject to removal requests from parents and community members.
They attempted to amend the bill to widen who can challenge a book to include anyone who lives in the school district, parent or otherwise. They also unsuccessfully tried to shield the name of challengers from open records requests.
A similar school library bill died during the 2024 legislative session, though one focused on public libraries was signed into law.

The Thursday order comes nearly two decades after the kidnap and murder of a Gulf Coast woman. Jordan, 78, is set to be executed June 25 at 6 p.m. at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. 
“After due consideration, the Court finds Jordan has exhausted all state and federal remedies for purposes of setting an execution date,” the court wrote. “Accordingly, the Court finds the State’s Motion to Set Execution Date should be granted and a date should be set for execution of the death sentence imposed upon Jordan.”
Eight of the nine justices ruled to grant the execution, and Justice Leslie King was the sole person who ruled to deny Jordan’s execution.

Jordan filed his most recent challenge of his death sentence in November 2024, arguing that it was invalid because the death penalty was not constitutional at the time of the murder of Edwina Marter. 
He also asked for the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his case, but that request was denied in March. 
The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected Jordan’s post-conviction petition on May 1, the same day it ordered his execution. 
Jordan was first convicted in 1976 for kidnapping Edwina Marter from Gulfport, killing her in a national forest and demanding ransom from her husband. 
The Hattiesburg native served in the Army after graduating from high school and fought in the Vietnam War. After the war, Jordan married and had three children but found it difficult to adjust to civilian life and experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder related to his combat experience, according to court records. 
In 1976 he was desperate for money and made plans to kidnap someone from a wealthy family and demand a ransom. Jordan called Gulf National Bank in Gulfport and found out the name of its commercial loan officer, Chuck Marter. 
He found Chuck Marter’s address from the telephone book and traveled from Louisiana. Jordan posed as an electric worker to get into the home, and then he took Edwina Marter to the DeSoto National Forest where he shot her. 
It took four trials spanning 20 years before Jordan was successfully convicted and sentenced to death. 
Jordan’s appeals have also been tied to legal challenges of the state’s lethal injection protocol. 
He and death row inmate Ricky Chase are lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the use of midazolam, a sedative, as one of the state’s three execution drugs. 
U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate hasn’t made a final ruling in the case, which he ordered stayed in March pending resolution of a 2023 motion for summary judgment by the prison defendants. 
In 2022, Wingate did not block the execution of Thomas Loden Jr., another death row inmate who was part of the lawsuit. If lethal injection is not an option, the state can put someone to death through other available methods: gas chamber, electrocution or firing squad.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081403/AP060710014048.jpg,,,2025-05-01 17:11:54.508082

(Courtesy image)OKLAHOMA CITY — State lawmakers moved one step closer to abandoning plans to construct a state-of-the-art inpatient mental health hospital in Oklahoma City amid massive cost overruns and construction delays.
A joint legislative subcommittee on Wednesday gave preliminary approval for the State Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services to abandon plans to build the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus located near the Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City campus.
They instead greenlighted spending millions in federal American Rescue Plan Act money to purchase land and renovate an existing building in central Oklahoma City.
Officials did not reveal where in central Oklahoma City that they’re proposing to open a new inpatient mental health hospital, but said it would house 197 beds. That’s far fewer than the 330 beds that were supposed to be built in the Donahue facility. It was expected to include 55 beds specifically designated for children and adolescents. 
Skip Leonard, the agency’s interim chief financial officer, said his agency wants to spend $19.1 million to purchase land and $31.5 million to renovate the two buildings on the site. 
Mental Health Commissioner Allie Friesen said the latest hospital design would have less focus on children, but could house criminal defendants needing competency restoration services. Such a renovation would provide the state an additional 32 beds to comply with the recent lawsuit settlement, she said.
When mental health officials first pitched the Donahue facility, they promised the bed count would increase capacity by 100 beds compared to what’s currently available at Griffin Memorial Hospital in Norman, which it was intended to replace.
Friesen said property owners at the prospective site have been transparent about the potential flaws at the new site that was constructed in 2001 and last renovated in 2017.
“We feel confident that we have a plan moving forward,” she said, adding that it still meets the mark of what the agency was aiming for.
It wasn’t clear Wednesday how much money the state has already spent on the construction of the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus. 
Leonard told lawmakers during a budget presentation Wednesday that the agency had spent about $6.45 million on the Donahue project, but Melissa Houston said there are actually three different expenditure amounts that need to be rectified ahead of a final vote taken by the full committee. Houston’s consulting firm is helping oversee the Legislature’s expenditure of APRA money.
Houston said lawmakers initially budgeted about $87 million to construct the new Donahue hospital and expected to net $50 million from the sale of the land in Norman where Griffin Memorial is located. The total project cost was $137 million, and the facility was supposed to open in December 2025, she said.
Currently, there’s about a $125 million funding gap in the budget, and the facility will not open until 2028, she said.
The plan to move ahead with a new inpatient hospital location still needs approval from the Joint Committee on Pandemic Relief Funding.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)The state is shining the spotlight on solar panel sales companies, with a new law and registry system taking effect Thursday that holds retailers accountable for door-to-door sales tactics, financial disclosures, and contract terms.
The updated state regulations and new, online public registry system reflect legislation passed during the 2024 legislative session and signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee on June 10. Consumer complaints over solar panel sales skyrocketed in recent years, with a majority directed at one company being sued by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office for allegedly preying upon and deliberately misleading senior and disabled residents.
The 2023 lawsuit against the company, Smart Green Solar, and its CEO, Jasjit Gotra, remains pending in Providence County Superior Court. 
Accused of deceptive practices, R.I. solar company CEO operates in unregulated business climate

Meanwhile, complaints against Gotra and Smart Green are still piling up. More than half of the 116 solar sales-related complaints logged with the AG’s office pertain to Smart Green. Another 25 of the 35 complaints submitted from January through March 2025 are directed at the same company, according to information from the AG’s office.
Which is why state regulators are turning to a registry, and new code of regulations, to prevent other potential bad actors from taking advantage of consumers.
“Rhode Islanders want to do their part to mitigate climate change, but they are rightfully weary of being taken financial advantage of in the solar sales space, as my Consumer Protection Team knows all too well,” Neronha said in a statement. “Today’s launch of the Solar Sales Registry is a significant step in putting much needed guardrails on the industry, so that consumers aren’t disincentivized by the deceptive behavior of certain companies. I look forward to seeing the implementation of this registry and am certain it will help move Rhode Island closer to meeting our climate goals.”
Like other licensed industries regulated by the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, the department is relying on consumer complaints to inform enforcement, said Elizabeth Dwyer, department director.
As of 3 p.m. Thursday, Dwyer had yet to hear from any aggrieved solar company customers. But if and when she does, the department stands ready to investigate. Violators could face fines of up to $5,000, along with cease-and-desist orders.
New rules limit hours for door-to-door solar sales from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. unless appointments outside those hours are pre-arranged. There is also a required financial disclosure form prior to any signed contracts, listing names and contact information for solar sales representatives, financers, and installers. A chief complaint voiced by Smart Green customers in interviews with Rhode Island Current was the inability to reach Gotra or other company representatives after signing a contract, even if problems arose.
The regulations also codify the seven-day window for customers to cancel signed contracts, which is standard to other industries. Sales companies are also required to make a “good faith estimate” on project costs and expected energy savings.
“Rhode Islanders deserve transparency and accountability when it comes to solar energy sales—that’s exactly what this new program delivers,” McKee said in a statement. “My administration is committed to protecting consumers while continuing to support the growth of clean energy in Rhode Island.”

‘Our goal is to be as reasonable as possible’
Separate from the immediately enforceable sales regulations, DBR has also launched a public-facing registry. Companies that sell solar panels in Rhode Island must pay $750 to register, and renew their registration each year for the same cost.
There is no firm deadline by which companies must complete registration. Dwyer said Thursday she expects the department will begin taking action within 30 to 60 days if it finds out eligible retailers failed to sign up.
“Our goal is to be as reasonable as possible,” she said. “The purpose is to get as many people as possible to sign up.”
The public portal does not show any registered companies as of Thursday, though applicants must be approved before their information is posted online.
Registered companies risk having their licenses revoked if they violate any of the state’s rules around sales practices and contract terms.
Dwyer estimates fewer than 50 solar panel companies are subject to the registry requirements, which do not extend to individual salespeople. The department plans to oversee the new licensing and enforcement rules with its existing staff, and is using software with a contracted vendor, Tyler Technologies, for the online registry.
“There are some costs, but they are interior costs,” Dwyer said, referring to legal and licensing advice. “We felt this was a small enough group, we could absorb it into our current workload. We will reevaluate if we feel there’s a need.”
The department sent emails to solar panel sales companies over the past few weeks to inform them about the registration launch. So far, no one has complained to Dwyer about the cost to register, or other rules, she said.
Gotra, who denounced the registry and accompanying regulations last year as a barrier to achieving the state’s decarbonization goals, did not respond to inquiries for comment Thursday.
A consent order entered on March 14, 2024, in the state’s lawsuit against Gotra and Smart Green stipulates Gotra must “refrain” from misrepresentations in his interactions and marketing to customers, along with other disclosures, until the case is adjudicated or settled. A procedural hearing on the case is scheduled for May 8, according to the public docket.

Greg Gianforte speaks before a bill signing ceremony for a suite of bills that make changes to Montana's environmental laws. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Three state representatives joined Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte for a bill signing ceremony for five new laws making changes to the Montana Environmental Policy Act. 
“At its simplest, MEPA is a process that ensures that we think about the potential environmental impacts of our decisions,” Gianforte said in remarks to press. “Last year, the Montana Supreme Court issued a series of rulings that led us to develop solutions to reduce potential litigation and provide certainty to Montana businesses, large and small, that are trying to make a living here in our state.” 
The suite of laws came as a direct response to the decision in the Held vs. Montana lawsuit, in which a district court judge found that the state could not limit the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions during the environmental review process. 
When the Montana Supreme Court upheld the ruling last December, incoming Republican legislative leaders told the courts to “buckle up” and brought a number of bills aimed at changing the judicial system as well as addressing the Held decision. 
“In the Held v. Montana court case, they tried to twist MEPA into something it was never meant to be — a tool to deny permits and block development,” House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said at the signing ceremony. “With the signing of this MEPA reform package, we’re making it clear that Montana’s environmental policy is about reform decision making, not weaponizing and litigation.”
Earlier during the session, House Democrats pushed back against many of the bills related to MEPA, including one brought by Ler. 

“Montanans expect us to defend their Constitutional right to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and that’s exactly what House Democrats did,” said Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, in a press release. “But some Republican politicians are determined to erode what makes Montana the last best place. We will continue to fight those efforts every step of the way.”
The Held lawsuit, brought by 16 youth plaintiffs from across the state, was the nation’s first constitutional climate change trial. A district court judge in Lewis and Clark County sided with the plaintiffs in 2023, and in December 2024, the Montana Supreme Court upheld the decision.  
The court found in a 6-to-1 decision that Montana’s constitutional guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment” includes a stable climate system. 
“Plaintiffs showed at trial — without dispute — that climate change is harming Montana’s environmental life support system now and with increasing severity for the foreseeable future,” the order stated. 
In response to the Supreme Court’s decision Democrats introduced bills that sought to strengthen MEPA’s role in protecting the environment, although none passed.
The majority of bills introduced, including the five signed on Thursday sponsored by Republicans, put sideboards on the environmental review process and clarified the state’s existing laws. 
Speaker Ler introduced House Bill 285, which he said was designed to provide clarity and efficiency to MEPA. 
The bill emphasizes that MEPA is a tool for assessing environmental impacts, not a regulatory mechanism.
“House Bill 285 sets the record straight: MEPA is procedural,” Ler said. “It’s a way to gather facts, weigh impacts and then make informed decisions, not dictate them. This bill reaffirms the Legislature’s intent.”
Ler’s bill passed both Legislative chambers along party lines.

Other MEPA-related bills drew more bipartisan support. 
House Bill 270, introduced by Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, updates MEPA language to remove the parts invalidated by the Held decision, alters the process if someone fails to comply with the act, and prevents state agencies from vacating permits without considering the economic effects. 
Her bill saw unanimous support in the House and saw only a handful of opponents in the Senate. 
Similarly, Senate Bill 221, carried by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, also drew support from both parties. 
His bill directed the Department of Environmental Quality to develop guidance on greenhouse gas emission assessments while aiming to prevent industry and development from getting bogged down in litigation. 
“Our next steps will be to develop that guidance document that will outline exactly how we will do greenhouse gas assessments for fossil fuel activities, as well as what parameters we’ll look at for non-fossil fuel activities,” said Sonja Nowakowski, director of DEQ. “These will be very open and transparent processes, and we look forward to engaging with the public and getting everyone’s input as we move forward.”
Gianforte also signed House Bill 291, which prevents the state from adopting more stringent standards for air pollutants than the federal government; and House Bill 466, which defines “categorial exclusions” for projects that do not require environmental assessments, similar to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Combined, Gianforte said the package of bills would help protect the state’s environment while bolstering the economy. 

“Left unchecked, the rulings would have impacted our energy sector at a time when Americans have seen the cost of electricity soar nearly 30% over the last four years,” Gianforte said.
Anne Hedges, director of the Montana Environmental Information Center, criticized many of the bills Gianforte signed, especially SB 221 and HB 285, saying they reduced MEPA to a “paper exercise.”
“Without the requirements in MEPA to fully analyze a project’s impacts, the state does not have a mechanism to comply with the public’s constitutional rights to know, to participate, and to have a clean and healthful environment,” Hedges said in a prepared statement. “The people of this state will not stand for a loss of these constitutional rights, and so these bills will only result in conflict and wasted state resources.”
Gianforte has signed 222 bills into law, as of Thursday afternoon, out of a total 878 passed by the Montana Legislature, according to the state’s bill tracker.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250501_120430-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-01 17:11:54.508082

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)Adding to the list of gun legislation before lawmakers this session, the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee held a public hearing for a series of proposals about the business practices of licensed dealers, prohibiting firearms at voting places and more. 
Earlier this session, the committee heard proposals to modify the state’s concealed carry laws that were ultimately voted down. The committee is also working on legislation that could update the definition of a machine gun, as well as bipartisan proposals about firearm hold agreements. 
And during a vote last month, Democratic lawmakers on the committee were split on what to do with a proposal to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines.
Here’s a closer look at the latest proposals and what the public had to say about them. 
Allowing towns to ban guns at polling places
In the spirit of Maine’s emphasis on local control, Rep. Poppy Arford (D-Brunswick) introduced LD 1743 that would allow municipalities to adopt an order, ordinance, policy or regulation that limits or prohibits firearms within its buildings and voting places and at public proceedings. The municipalities would be required to post the rule in a prominent location outside of all buildings.
Though local and state government proceedings can be contentious, Arford said people shouldn’t be deterred from engaging in those meetings or voting out of fear of someone bringing a firearm. 
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who is also running for governor next year, said towns should have the option to regulate firearms in polling places because there is often anxiety over threats to election workers that data collected by her office shows persist. 
“This may not be right for every municipality, but for some, it could be the right option, and we believe they should have the option,” she said, speaking in favor of the bill. 
Bellows was asked if she was concerned over this proposal restricting one right for the sake of exercising another. She said this didn’t concern her, comparing it to the First Amendment limitations that already exist at polling places so as to not influence other voters. 
Opponents argued that people intent on committing crimes aren’t deterred by gun-free zones. 
Restoring Second Amendment rights
Working a patrol shift in Piscataquis County, Rep. Chad Perkins (R-Dover-Foxcroft), who is a former law enforcement officer, said he was accosted by two people. He needed help, as his nearest back up was 15 minutes away, when a nearby community member came out to help Perkins get both individuals into custody. 
After the situation settled down, Perkins went back to thank the individual who helped him and found out that he was barred from his Second Amendment right to bear arms given the felony conviction on his record from a burglary he committed when he was a teenager. 
Perkins has met others in a similar situation, which is why he proposed LD 1009, a “restorative justice bill” that would provide an avenue to restore civil rights for a person convicted of a nonviolent felony after they have repaid their debt to society. The legislation stipulates that those rights can’t be restored until 10 years after any imposed sentence is completed. 
Perkins was asked if he would support a different approach to defelonize those nonviolent crimes, but he declined saying there needs to be a price to pay to bring justice for victims. However, the representative is open to the committee amending the aspect of his proposal that lays out the process to have one’s rights restored so long as it maintains the intent of the bill. 
The bill language currently excludes drug offenses from the list of convictions eligible for a person to have their rights restored. Perkins was asked about this and said he would not object if the committee decided it wanted to allow someone with a possession conviction to be included. 
Maine lawmakers weigh proposals to beef up firearm storage, hold agreements

The legislation currently asks the Department of Public Safety to review applications for a person to have their rights restored by looking at criminal history and other pertinent information. The department would then notify the courts, which would ultimately issue the order restoring the right. 
The department opposed the bill because of limited resources that would make it difficult to take on the additional workload. While the judicial branch testified neither for nor against the proposal, a representative pointed out that there is not a current electronic mechanism for the department to communicate this sort of information with the courts nor does the bill leave room for any judicial review. 
Security requirements for gun shops 
While praising the professionalism of the vast majority of gun shop owners in Maine, Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth) introduced a bill to help federal firearm licensees comply with regulations and feel more equipped to safely do their jobs. LD 1821 would require the Department of Public Safety to adopt rules specifying minimum security requirements for shops. This could include alarm systems, surveillance cameras and record retention. 
Kuhn said other states have adopted similar measures, but she didn’t want to copy from them completely. Instead, she hoped to give the department a chance to craft rules that take into account the small business landscape in Maine. 
The bill also outlines required signage that would need to be posted by firearm dealers and at gun shows about background check requirements, suicide prevention resources and firearm safety course information. 
While proponents of the legislation said it offered a chance for differing views to work together on common firearm safety goals, multiple gun shop owners said it would be impractical and a cost burden, particularly the proposal for shops to keep surveillance footage for multiple years. 
Additionally, the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine argued that the bill was unnecessary because many of the requirements either conflict or overlap with existing federal requirements. 
“ATF’s got this covered,” said Executive Director David Trahan, referring to regulations developed by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Kuhn told the committee she was going to create a chart showing which requirements already exist in federal or state law to more clearly illustrate which of the bill’s proposals are new. 
The Department of Public Safety, as well as the Maine State Police, opposed the bill because the agencies said they do not have the capacity to undertake a rulemaking process or enforce the proposed provisions. 
Public health signage
Though guns are deeply rooted in Maine’s culture, Rep. Holly Stover (D-Boothbay) said they also pose a risk to public health, which is why she sponsored LD 1379. She referenced the announcement last June from then-U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy declaring gun violence a public health crisis. 
The proposal would require firearm dealers and gunsmithers to post warnings stating the risk of firearms to public health and that access to them increases the risk of suicide, domestic violence fatalities and unintentional deaths.
Stover argued this would not serve as a ban, but as an awareness and prevention measure similar to the labels found on tobacco products or alcohol that meet consumers at the point of sale. She also characterized this as one component of a comprehensive approach needed to prevent deaths and injuries from firearms. 
However, Justin Davis, state director for the National Rifle Association, said that idea has been used as a “political football” in recent years. He argued that Stover’s proposal would deter first-time buyers, rather than steer them toward gun safety training for responsible ownership. 
“That’s not gun safety, that’s gun avoidance,” Davis said. 
Disposition of forfeited firearms 
After asking the committee to kill one of her bills that contained a drafting error, Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport) introduced LD 411, which would require most forfeited guns in the state to be destroyed. 
Current law requires that firearms used in a murder or homicide be destroyed. Other firearms that are forfeited in the event of a crime are often auctioned off by the state. 
Sachs argued the bill does not demonize firearms, but seeks to address the difference between firearms used in crimes and those used responsibly. 
When asked about cutting off forfeited firearm auctions as a revenue stream from the state, Sachs pointed to the fiscal note on the bill that showed the minor cost incurred by the bill could be absorbed in the existing budget. 
Trahan, of the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine who also spoke against this bill, said he would submit an amendment for the committee to consider that would redirect the revenue from state hosted firearm auctions to safe storage measures. 
Also testifying against the bill, Davis cautioned the committee against thinking that people who want to purchase firearms at a lower price — like they usually are at these auctions — do so with the intention of committing a crime. 
No one spoke in support of the bill during the committee meeting Thursday.

(Getty Images)Nearly all of Kentucky’s 171 public school districts have signed an agreement to adhere to the Trump administration’s new restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools.
Only two school districts — Fayette and Jefferson counties — did not sign a form from the U.S. Department of Education  to certify their compliance with the Trump administration’s interpretations of civil rights law, according to documents from the Kentucky Department of Education. 
Sent last month, the federal agency’s certification form says that “any violation of Title VI — including the use of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (‘DEI’) programs to advantage one’s race over another — is impermissible” and using “certain DEI practices can violate federal law.” Title VI of the 1963 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
The school superintendents of Fayette and Jefferson counties instead provided alternative documents saying they comply with federal and state laws. Jefferson County has the state’s largest student enrollment, followed by Fayette County. 
KDE provided the documents to the Kentucky Lantern in response to an open records request. 
In a joint statement to news outlets last week about the district’s decision, Fayette County Public Schools Superintendent Demetrus Liggins and school board Chair Tyler Murphy said they “want to reaffirm that Fayette County Public Schools remains steadfast in our commitment to ensuring every student receives the support they need to thrive.” The statement said the decision was based on data about students’ needs within the district. 
“As we affirm each year, we continue to fully comply with the requirements of Title VI and all civil rights laws, not simply as a legal obligation, but as a reflection of who we are and what we stand for,” Liggins and Murphy said. “We will also continue to support and defend the programs that help our students — all of our students — reach their full potential. That is a commitment that has not and will not change.” 
Jefferson County Public Schools Superintendent Marty Pollio wrote in an April 22 letter to USED that “the schools within our district are in compliance with” federal law, including Title VI. A spokesperson told the Lantern that as of Thursday, JCPS had not received any further communication from USED regarding the form. 
Kentucky Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher has previously said KDE signed the form a couple of weeks ago, but added the form “is not without issues,” in a message to superintendents across the state. KDE did not suspend or pause any of its existing programs since it received the form from USED. 
Fletcher also advised that “school districts should consult with board counsel on whether the district will sign the certification form.” 
One superintendent, Teresa Morgan of Hardin County Schools, pushed back on USED’s request to sign the form. 
“It is with great disgust and sadness that I am signing this document,” Morgan wrote in an addendum to the form. “The fact that federal funds would be withheld from our neediest students — simply because of a refusal to sign a document that serves to further divide our country — is deeply troubling.” 
Morgan declined to expand on her comment in an email Thursday morning. The federal form outlined possible consequences for a state or local education agency that protects a DEI program that violates the new federal guidance, including losing federal funding or facing a federal lawsuit. 
One school district that did sign the form, Bowling Green Independent Schools, did so “at the request of the Kentucky Department of Education commissioner,” said district spokesperson Leslie McCoy in an email to the Lantern. She added the district believes it is “in compliance with all state and federal nondiscrimination laws” and has not received further contact from USED about Title VI compliance. 
USED’s targeting of DEI practices comes as Republicans at the national and state levels seek to roll back such measures, particularly in education. The GOP-controlled Kentucky General Assembly passed a law earlier this year to ban DEI programs at Kentucky public universities and colleges. President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at eliminating DEI programs within the federal government shortly after he assumed office in January. 
The 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down affirmative action in higher education admissions has further fueled backlash against DEI programs. That ruling is cited in the USED form K-12 school officials were asked to sign. 
In general, DEI initiatives focus on supporting marginalized people in areas where they have been historically excluded. But they’ve come under fire, and not just from the right, as discriminatory themselves. DEI programs, the U.S. Department of Education acting assistant secretary for civil rights wrote in a February letter, “frequently preference certain racial groups and teach students that certain racial groups bear unique moral burdens that others do not.”
Kentucky’s legislature has not outlawed DEI in public K-12 schools, although legislation was filed this year to do so. Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, filed bills that would have prohibited DEI initiatives in the state’s public schools as well as state and local governments. Neither bill got a committee hearing.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hs-classroom-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 17:11:54.508082

The trio has a new podcast out called “House of Maher.” Courtesy photo via the Community News ServiceMaddie Lindgren is a reporter with Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.The “House of Maher” is what you get when you combine three crazy funny women with a knack for storytelling and an obsession with sister FaceTimes.It’s a one-of-a-kind, unfiltered podcast where sisters Ilona, Olivia and Adrianna Maher share everything from intimate life confessions to hilarious stories.Born and raised in Burlington, the Maher sisters bring their unique personalities and life experiences to the mic — and they are not scared to shy away from anything. From childhood birthday parties in grocery store aisles to big life questions about self-worth and mental health, the sisters have built a space where laughter and vulnerability go hand in hand.“We wanted to do it right,” said Adrianna Maher, a 2021 Castleton University graduate. “What inspired us was our sister’s video calls — we always have such a blast. I feel like we’re our funniest selves over FaceTime.”And that FaceTime energy is exactly what listeners get. One moment you’re listening to Adrianna’s feud with neon signs outside of restaurants, and in other moments you explore deep conversations around anxiety or how working out and having some time off for yourself can influence the lives of people.“We talk about literally everything,” Adrianna said. “I know how lucky I am to even be in a space where we have a podcast that people want to listen to. And so, it’s been a cool time. I’m very grateful for everything.”The Mahers are a close-knit family and each member brings a very different personality to the table. Ilona is the Olympic rugby player, huge social media personality and “Dancing with the Stars” runner-up. She brings confidence and quick sarcasm.Olivia is the oldest sister and also a Castleton graduate. She’s the creator of the viral “Girl Dinner” trend, is unapologetically quirky and very creative.Adrianna Maher is a New York City human rights activist with a gift for insight, and is the youngest of the three.The sisters may be spread all over the country — Ilona and Olivia in California, Adrianna in New York — but their bond has never been stronger. Their podcast is not just content; it’s a connection for them.“It was just kind of the perfect project to start together and just be able to be sisters even more,” Adrianna said.Vermont makes regular appearances — whether it’s heartfelt memories from their small-town childhood or shoutouts to quirky Vermontisms that only New Englanders will understand.“I’m always going to be a Vermonter. Vermont will always have my heart,” Adrianna said. “We had a really good public school education there, and my mom, Olivia, and I all went to Castleton.”Dave Blow, a professor of communications at Vermont State University Castleton who taught both Olivia and Adrianna at Castleton, isn’t surprised the trio is taking over the podcasting world.“Liv was very outgoing … she was everywhere,” Blow said. “She played guitar on the steps of Woodruff (Hall) and made up a song to the tune of ‘12 Days of Christmas.’ She was a lot of fun in class.”Blow said he remembers a blog assignment of Olivia’s for his feature writing class that had her classmates, and him, howling. She called the blog “Liv Sips,” which she would write after a glass of wine or two.“It was hilarious,” he said. “People were tuned in to hear what she had to say.”Adrianna, meanwhile, left a quieter but lasting impression, and her time at Castleton was marred by the COVID-19 pandemic.“She was deep, but also funny. One that sticks out to me was something she wrote for a COVID Chronicles blog about taking the senior year thing too far — doing puzzles at home like she was a senior citizen,” he said.Some of her entries for the class assignment were turned into a book by Blow called “COVID Chronicles.”Blow says what makes the Mahers special is their mix of humor, heart and authenticity.“They come across as this cool, normal-ish family with good values,” he said. “They’re good people, raised right. It’s one of the coolest things about being a professor — seeing students like them take off.”Blow isn’t the only teacher at Castleton who holds the Mahers in high regards.VTSU Castleton communications Professor Michael Talbott said he remembers having the sisters in class as well.“Liv was one of those students who was exceptional from the beginning, a great contributor to class work, really engaged, jumped at every opportunity, involved in everything,” Talbott said.The sisters’ dynamic is strong, thanks in part to their openness and communication.“We’re very vocal people,” Adrianna said. “So, if we have an issue, we’re not stewing on it. Let’s fix it. Let’s figure it out.”Their creative process shows the trust they have in each other.“It’s wonderful to work with them,” she said. “We already have such a great foundation together … there’s always a way we can figure anything out.”While Olivia and Ilona are more used to sharing their lives online, Adrianna admitted she’s more cautious.“I’ve always been very aware of privacy and anonymity,” she said. “Olivia and Ilona have already shared so much. So, they’re less afraid, but I’m getting the hang of it more.”Still, the sisters are committed to honesty and authenticity.“We’re telling our stories unfiltered — little thoughts and situations that remind people: everyone feels this way,” Adrianna said.That balance of serious and silly is what makes “House of Maher” feel like a hug — with a side of sass.“We want to build something lasting,” Adrianna said. “More seasons and more episodes that people can come back to — a place where our three voices shine.” Whether they’re diving into awkward dates, recounting bizarre moments, or tackling heavy topics with grace and grit, the Maher sisters are a trio you’ll want to hang out with again and again.“The House of Maher” is available now on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube and other podcast platforms.Read the story on VTDigger here:  A pair of Castleton University grads join Olympian sister in new podcast.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/House-of-Maher-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 17:11:54.508082

(Photo courtesy of the New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department)New Mexico officials say Head Start remains stable for now in the state amid mounting concerns about federal efforts to dismantle the program. 
While Head Start funding has been an ongoing issue since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, recent reports that the Trump administration seeks its elimination have ramped up pushback. 
On Monday, several Head Start providers and parent associations filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, along with Secretary Robert. F. Kennedy Jr., for unlawfully attempting to demolish Head Start programs and going against Congress’ mandate to operate such programs in the country.
“All parents deserve the opportunity to provide a better life for their children,” Candice Vickers, executive director of Family Forward Oregon, a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement provided by the ACLU. “Head Start gives children and families, including Black, Indigenous, Pacific Islander, Latinx, and immigrant children and families, a fair opportunity to work towards a better life. Taking this program away continues cycles of poverty and unfairly targets the children and families it was created to support.”
New Mexico Democrats U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján signed onto a letter this week, along with 40 other U.S. senators, to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “demanding” that the administration unfreeze funding to Head Start programs and “reverse” mass firing of program employees. Luján frequently comments on his time in Head Start as a child, and points out that he is one of two Head Start graduates to serve in the U.S. Senate.
“Already this year, this Administration has withheld almost $1 billion in federal grant funding from Head Start programs, a 37 percent decrease compared to the amount of funding awarded during the same period last year,” the letter reads. “It is abundantly clear that these actions are part of a broader effort to ultimately eliminate the program altogether, as the Administration reportedly plans to do in its fiscal year 2026 budget proposal.”
The letter also points to a statement made by the National Head Start Association in February, which claimed that programs in 23 states that were awarded federal grants were having problems accessing the money. The association projects more programs have been impacted in the following months.
New Mexico, according to the state Early Childhood Education and Care Department’s  February 2025 fact sheet, has 2,233 funded Early Head Start slots for New Mexico children and 5,457 funded Head Start slots. Programs provide accessible childcare and prepare children up to 3 or 4 years of age from low-income families to enter school successfully. Programs also provide meals to children and access to community resources for families at no cost.
Thus far, they remain unaffected, officials told Source.
“New Mexico Head Start programs are still able to access funds, and we have had no reports of interruptions. We have been in close contact with our Head Start programs to ensure that services continue without disruption,” Julia Sclafani, spokesperson for New Mexico’s early childhood department, told Source NM in a written statement. “We are monitoring developments regarding the proposed closure of regional Head Start offices and any potential federal funding cuts.”
And while the future of Head Start programs is uncertain at this time, Sclafani added that “the State of New Mexico remains firmly committed to supporting early childhood services, including maintaining access to Head Start programs for children and families.”

(Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)PHILADELPHIA — A federal appeals panel heard arguments Thursday in a high-stakes legal battle over a controversial New Jersey law that bans immigration detention facilities run by anyone other than federal authorities, a move private prison companies say hampers the federal government’s immigration enforcement. 
Solicitor General Jeffrey Feigenbaum from the state Office of the Attorney General argued that the law doesn’t ban detention facilities altogether, and that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or Immigration and Customs Enforcement could build or lease a facility and operate it themselves without it substantially interfering in enforcement efforts. 
“The law says consider what’s available, including to buy or lease private facilities. That’s the preference,” he said. “They can buy or lease facilities today and operate it themselves. They could buy or lease the Elizabeth Detention Center itself. And then if it’s not there, go build your own.”
At the heart of the case is a 2021 state law prohibiting private companies, as well as local, county or state governments, from renewing or signing new contracts to operate federal immigration detention centers. CoreCivic, the private prison company that runs the Elizabeth Detention Center, sued the state over the law, charging it violates the Supremacy Clause by interfering with immigration enforcement. The Elizabeth jail is the only facility statewide now in use for federal immigration detention.
A federal judge in 2023 struck down the part of the law that bars private companies from detaining immigrants, and the state appealed. That appeal was heard Thursday after 18 months of waiting — and on the heels of a different private company announcing plans to open a new immigrant jail in Newark. A decision is likely months away. 
During the two-hour hearing at the James A. Byrne United States Courthouse, the panel of three judges hammered both sides with tough questions. U.S. 3rd Circuit Judge Cheryl Ann Krause called it a “complex, very interesting case.”

Outside, activists gathered to voice support for immigrants in a legal fight expected to determine the scope of federal immigration detention in New Jersey. They held signs urging the government to “stop kidnapping people.”
Feigenbaum told the appellate judges that the law does not bar federal authorities from detaining immigrants in New Jersey. Instead, it just doesn’t allow them to contract the facilities to a private company. If Congress passed a law laying out “a private right to provide detention for a company like CoreCivic, then this is an easy case,” he said. 
“The way our law handles competing burdens on private interests is by letting Congress make that choice,” he said. 
U.S. 3rd Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas peppered him with hypotheticals, like whether a state could ban the U.S. Mint from hiring private contractors to print money or prohibit defense contractors from building munitions for the Department of Defense. Feigenbaum said those cases would depend on how the hypothetical law is written. 
New Jersey’s law doesn’t regulate immigration detention — that’s  ICE’s job — but rather, the market for prison services, Feigenbaum emphasized.
CoreCivic’s team countered that the law would be a “nightmare” for immigration enforcement, which has ramped up dramatically under President Donald Trump’s second term in office. Without immigrant detention centers in North Jersey, close to international airports, federal authorities would have to detain people in other states and spend hours transporting them to further locales, said Bradley Simon, CoreCivic’s attorney.
“The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over immigration enforcement, and this is putting a major, major roadblock in their efforts to do their jobs in the state of New Jersey and would absolutely have a catastrophic effect on the whole area,” he said. 
The judges questioned whether New Jersey’s law would increase the feds’ immigration enforcement costs. 
“If the New Jersey statute went into effect, it would have enormous cost, but it goes way beyond cost, the whole analysis, the impact it will have,” Simon said. 
Attorney McKaye Neumeister, representing the U.S. Department of Justice, said states can’t regulate the relationship between the federal government and companies it contracts with. She also noted the government uses private contractors “all the time, for all sorts of things.” 
“There are all sorts of functions that the government relies on contractors, for various reasons. The reasons here are in order to ensure flexibility and for cost savings,” she said. 
After the hearing, Dante Apaéstegui of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice said he wasn’t persuaded by CoreCivic’s arguments that the law would wreak havoc. 
“I was baffled that they said the law would be the cause of separating families, the cause of separating communities — not the fact that there was a detention center there in our communities profiting off of their incarceration,” Apaéstegui said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Thursday sent Gov. Kevin Stitt a bill that would bar obscene performances on public property or areas where minors are present despite concerns that it is unconstitutional and aimed at impacting drag shows.
House Bill 1217 makes it a crime to engage in adult performances, or to permit them, on public property where a minor could view them. Violators would be guilty of a misdemeanor subject to a fine of up to $1,000, one year in jail or both.
Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, the Senate author, said the bill does not mention drag shows.
“If the behavior is obscene, regardless of dress, then it should not be allowed in front of minors,” Bullard said.
Critics said state law already prohibits obscene displays. They said the measure targets drag performances, the LGBTQ+ community and violates constitutionally protected free speech rights.
“Let’s be clear from the outset that House Bill 1217 is an anti-speech, anti-queer, anti-art bill masquerading as a protection against obscenity,” said Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City. “It does not use the word drag. But make no mistake. This bill is absolutely about drag.”
Opposing the bill is a “wink at corruption,” said Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin.
“We are living in a time where grown men parade around in lingerie and exaggerated prosthetics, performing in front of wide-eyed toddlers in public and at libraries, and some call that progress,” Deevers said. “That’s not progress. It is perversion. And Jesus calls it evil.”
Deevers asked why it is acceptable to arrest someone for exposing themselves at a park, but not when they “wear exaggerated prosthetics and gyrate in front of children.”
Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, said because the language is so broad, it could ban theatrical performances, cultural performances and cheerleading routines.
“What this is really about is one small group in our community, a group of our neighbors, making another small group in our community uncomfortable, and so we’re going to have a piece of legislation to go after one group because it makes another group uncomfortable,” Mann said.
Sen. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa, said there was a time when Elvis Presley, known for gyrating his hips, could only be videoed from the top up because some felt he was so sexually obscene that it was not good for public viewing.
The measure passed by a vote of 39-8.

(Raze photo)Raze, a youth-led program aimed at preventing youth smoking and vaping in West Virginia for more than 20 years, will end this summer because of state and federal funding cuts, the organization said Thursday. 
The program will run out of money June 30. Leaders have started to alert participating middle and high schools and adult advisors that there will be no more support for the program after that, said Chaste Barclay, director of health promotions for the American Lung Association, which supports the program.
“We are devastated that the administration in Washington and state leaders eliminated funding support for tobacco education programs for Raze youth and their schools,” the organization said in a statement Thursday. “Over the years, this program has saved lives and reduced the burden of tobacco use in youth. The program made incredible progress in reducing youth tobacco use in West Virginia, and we can’t allow funding decisions to reverse this progress.”
West Virginia has some of the highest rates in the country for adult and youth cigarette and e-cigarette use. In 2022, 21% of West Virginia adults smoked, according to the American Lung Association. That same year, 27.5% of teenagers in the state used electronic cigarettes, the organization said. 
West Virginia also has among the highest rates for tobacco-caused cancer deaths in the country. 
Raze received $315,000 for the 2025 fiscal year, Barclay said. The majority of the funding was from the federal government. That money came from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s Office of Smoking and Health, which was eliminated as of April 1. 
As for state funding, a spokeswoman for the House of Delegates said the state budget has not included a regular allocation for the Tobacco Education Program since 2017, and a governor has not requested funding for the program since then. The state may have provided the program with supplemental funds since then, she said. 
“[The American Lung Association] has been around for 120-plus years, and have worked through all the different administrations and the ups and downs,” Barclay said. “So it’s just unfortunate the timing. But we’ll continue to look for funding. Hopefully we can get it back in some way and be able to support it.”
This year, 1,558 West Virginia teens from 53 different groups participated in the Raze program, the organization said in the statement. Participants completed more than 1,600 tobacco education activities aimed at bringing awareness to the dangers of tobacco use using peer-to-peer education, the organization said. 
While the program started with the goal of preventing youth cigarette use, the main messaging from the program for years now has been preventing use of e-cigarettes and vapes, Barclay said. 
Without the program, Barclay said the state’s youth smoking and vaping rates will increase. The tobacco-related products keep changing, she said, and younger and younger kids are using them. 
“We’ve heard of fourth and fifth graders using [them],” she said. “So I think without that activism out there, and peer-to-peer education, which has been so successful in the past, I think we’re just going to see an increase in numbers. And so that’ll lead to future generations being addicted, and additional health issues down the line, and billions of dollars in health care.”
The organization called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey to include a tobacco prevention bill that died during the regular session on the call for a potential special legislative session this year. 
House Bill 3521 would have allocated $1.19 million from a state settlement with the vaping manufacturer Juul to tobacco education efforts in the state. The state settled with the company in 2023 for $7.9 million in a lawsuit that alleged the company targeted minors with their advertising. 
The bill passed in the 93 to 6 in the House of Delegates but was pending in the Senate finance committee when the session ended. 
“We urge Gov. Morrisey to include this legislation in a special session to ensure that the funding is used for its original intent and continues the good work we have done to reduce youth tobacco use in West Virginia,” the organization said. 
The governor’s office did not immediately return an email seeking comment Thursday.

The CT Mirror’s staff won six first place awards for government reporting, investigative reporting, data reporting, continuing coverage, general commentary, and arts, entertainment, food & leisure reporting. CT Mirror reporters also placed second or third in religion, business, education and in-depth local reporting. 
John Moritz and Emilia Otte, who recently joined the CT Mirror staff, were also honored as for their previous reporting for Hearst Connecticut Media and the Connecticut Examiner.
The judges of the journalism contest presented Andrew Brown and Dave Altimari with the Theodore Driscoll Award for Investigative Reporting for several stories that explained how state officials abruptly cancelled a Medicaid audit that was examining the fraudulent billing practices for a Connecticut eye doctor. 
The Theodore Driscoll Award is one of the CT SPJ’s top honors and is awarded to stories that contain information that is “not readily available to the news media or public.”
The judges described the reporting as “a dogged investigation” that “revealed that a politically connected eye doctor was the only medical provider to have a Medicaid audit canceled.” 
“Through persistent FOI requests and careful analysis, Brown and Altimari exposed this irregularity, prompting federal scrutiny and leading to criminal charges. Their crisp pacing and accessible storytelling brought clarity to a complex topic, transforming dense policy reporting into compelling public service journalism.”
The judges also bestowed the contest’s First Amendment Award on CT Mirror reporters Ginny Monk and Andrew Brown for coverage that revealed a string of alleged child abuse at an adolescent psychiatric treatment facility.
The First Amendment Award goes a story or series that “increases the public understanding of the role of the press in a free society.”
Monk and Brown spent more than a year requesting inspection records and other documents related to the Children’s Center of Hamden. The documents revealed how state officials were forced to repeatedly freeze admissions to the facilities because of reports of child neglect and abuse. 
The judges credited that story as an “excellent use of public records and human sources to expose abuses in a system intended to protect vulnerable children.”
“It’s always gratifying to be recognized by our peers, and this year was particularly special as we received awards for some of our most ambitious work,” said Executive Editor Elizabeth Hamilton. “The stories recognized this year by CT SPJ not only show the breadth of talent on the staff, they also demonstrate how critically important it is to have a robust, free press in this country. Congratulations, too, to all the journalists at other Connecticut news organizations who were recognized for their work this year.”
The other stories that were recognized as part of the contest highlight the range of the CT Mirror’s news coverage during 2024. The award winners included the following stories and columns:

(Screenshot | DNR)Gov. Tony Evers on Thursday made two appointments to the Natural Resources Board, the body that sets policy for the state Department of Natural Resources and has been the venue for a number of partisan disputes in recent years. 
Evers reappointed Bill Smith, the board’s current chair, to his seat and appointed former Vernon County conservationist Jeff Hastings. 
Smith was first appointed to the board in 2019 and worked for the DNR for more than 30 years. 
“Over the last several years, the Natural Resources Board has worked on high-profile issues that have captured the attention of the public, and I am glad for the opportunity to continue this important work and advocate for the issues that people across the state feel so passionately about — our state’s green spaces and natural environment,” Smith said in a statement. “My years of experience on the Board lend a unique perspective on the challenges we address as a body, and I am grateful to the governor for the opportunity to continue that work.” 
In addition to working for Vernon County, Hastings worked at Trout Unlimited, serving as project manager of its Driftless Area Restoration Effort to conserve cold water fish habitat in western Wisconsin. Hastings is replacing Marcy West, whose term expired Thursday. 
“I am thrilled to be able to translate my years of work in conservation to the efforts of the Natural Resources Board,” Hastings said. “It is an honor to take up this role, and I look forward to working together with my fellow members to best serve the interests of Wisconsinites and uphold the responsibility we share to preserve and protect our state’s natural resources and wildlife.”
Members of the seven-person Natural Resources Board serve staggered six-year terms to prevent all appointments being made during one governor’s term. Three members are required to be from the northern part of the state, three members must be from the southern part of the state and there is one at-large member. At least three members must have held a hunting, fishing or trapping license in seven of the 10 years before their nomination. 
While the governor appoints members to the board, the Republican controlled Senate confirms them. The board, which has say over hot button issues such as wolf management and water quality standards, has become a regular flash point in the divide between Evers and the Senate. 
Both Hastings and Smith will need to be confirmed to their seats, but state law allows them to fill the role in the meantime.
In 2021, Republicans in the Senate worked with former board chairman Frederick Prehn to keep him in his seat on the board for more than a year after his term’s expiration in an effort to keep appointees of Gov. Scott Walker in control of the board. 
In 2023, the Senate fired four of Evers’ appointees to the board and last year the Senate failed to confirm another Evers board nominee.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The American dream Maranda Kealy was promised as a kid is nowhere to be found, she said at a rally Thursday in Topeka attended by hundreds in a display of collective action against President Donald Trump’s second term.
“It’s not the one any of us were promised,” she said.
Kealy, a 22-year-old from the small town of Harveyville about 45 minutes southwest of Topeka, held a sign that read, “Dude: This is so not the American dream.”
“We were promised freedom and the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Kealy said, “but the administration has taken that to mean life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for some people, not all.”
The political grassroots group 50501 organized the event in honor of International Workers’ Day, celebrated on May 1 along with the European holiday May Day. The same group convened weeks before on April 5 at the state Capitol for a day of action, drawing a crowd of thousands. Thursday’s protest was more modest, with a crowd of around 300.
Kealy works for the U.S. Postal Service, and she is a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Both were impetuses for her presence on the Statehouse grounds.
“Every American deserves due process. Every American deserves a chance to live the American dream, and every person deserves a chance to have their voice heard,” Kealy said.
A mishmash of anti-Trump, pro-Ukraine, anti-Putin, pro-democracy, anti-Elon Musk signs and American flags — both upside down and right side up — speckled the south lawn of the Kansas Statehouse as the event’s speakers railed against the Trump administration and the president’s supporters.
The event’s speakers included 50501 organizers, Overland Park Democratic Sen. Cindy Holscher, the vice president of chapter 66 of the National Treasury Employees Union in Kansas City, Daniel Scharpenburg, and the Rev. Nori Rost, a Unitarian Universalist minister in Lawrence and social justice advocate.

Scharpenburg’s union represents roughly 6,000 employees of the Internal Revenue Service.
“I don’t know if you’ve heard,” he said to the crowd, “but we are not OK.”
The IRS’s Kansas City office is facing the possibility of being halved, Scharpenburg said. He lobbed critiques at the Trump administration’s moves to clamp down on unions.
“I have to say, if they were not afraid of working people, they would not try to union bust, right?” he said.
The American Federation of Laborers and Congress of Industrial Organizations, an international federation of more than 60 unions, said May 1 is “the day the world celebrates the bravery of workers throughout history who have sacrificed for safety, dignity and justice on the job.”
“Our solidarity is our strength,” the AFL-CIO said in a Thursday message. “We take pride in knowing that we are a global movement standing up to the billionaires who are threatening our rights and freedoms.”
‘Not where I want to be’
Holscher reminded the crowd of the president’s promise to lower prices at the grocery store. The crowd laughed.
“It is quite apparent, however, in these first 100 days of the Trump administration, we have been sold a bill of goods,” Holscher said.
She criticized state Republican leaders, referring to them as MAGA extremists, for a handful of their decisions during the 2025 legislative session, including the creation of the Committee on Government Efficiency and their “assault” on public education funding.
She warned of Republicans sending Kansas “back to the deficit days of the Brownback administration.”
The rally was 61-year-old Army veteran David Beck’s first time participating in something like it.
“This is not where I want to be,” he said.
He lives about 90 miles from Topeka and was born and raised in southeast Kansas. Everything is at stake, he said.
“What hasn’t he harmed?” he asked, referring to Trump.

Tina Hallenbeck, of Alma, celebrated her birthday by protesting the “scary, scary things” she sees happening under the Trump administration.
She said she was especially concerned for her husband, a retired active duty Army Gulf War veteran and a federal employee with a year left to retire.
Hallenbeck appeared at the Capitol dressed in the red uniform of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the 1985 novel by Margaret Atwood about a near-future dystopia where women are forcibly assigned to produce children.
“It feels like it makes a statement. Somebody’s going to see this,” Hallenbeck said. “Today, May Day, it’s my birthday, I’m 58 years old, and this is what I’m doing today, and it’s a shame that I have to be, but I have to be. We have to be vigilant. We can’t have 1930s Germany in the United States.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders have announced that lawmakers will not be convening a veto override session this year after Gov. Spencer Cox stopped six bills from becoming law. 
“Even when our perspectives differ, we appreciate the governor’s willingness to find common ground as we build an even brighter future for our great state,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said in a prepared statement issued Thursday. 
“After careful consideration, the Legislature has decided not to convene a veto override session,” they said. “We will focus on constructive dialogue and thoughtful policymaking during the interim to find the best path forward that benefits all Utahns.” 
Among the most controversial bills Cox vetoed — and was perhaps one that could have had the best chance of a veto override —  was SB296, a bill that would have given the governor and the Legislature the power to appoint the Utah Supreme Court’s next chief justice every four years. 
Currently, the state’s highest court’s five justices elect their own leader. 
‘A broad attack’: Utah’s judiciary fights bills threatening its independence

It was one of a handful of bills seeking changes to the state’s judiciary, which has clashed with Utah lawmakers. Republicans’ have expressed frustration with recent court rulings and they want to have more legislative influence over how the state’s top court functions. 
Along with SB296, there were several other bills that legal professionals across the state decried as threatening the judiciary’s “independence and integrity.” But after Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Durrant met with lawmakers during the 2025 session, legislative leaders announced a deal with the judiciary that they would abandon three controversial bills — including one that would give legislators a say in judicial retention elections — and instead only proceed with passing SB296. 
However, despite that deal, Cox decided to veto SB296, saying it went too far by requiring the state’s chief justice to be reappointed every four years. He wrote in his veto letter that the decision was “mine and mine alone,” and that no one from the judicial branch asked him for the veto. 
“I admit it is very tempting to sign this bill and assure that the Chief Justice would need to stay in my good graces to retain his or her position,” Cox wrote. “Knowing the head magistrate of our state’s highest court would have to think twice before ruling against me or checking my power is difficult to reject. I also recognize that refusing power is not en vogue these days and may be seen as weakness. But just because I can, doesn’t mean I should.”
Cox vetoes bill that would have given governor power over appointing Utah chief justice

At the time of Cox’s veto, Schultz and Adams said the move “undermines that good-faith compromise” between the Legislature and judiciary that ultimately led to lawmakers abandoning the other bills, and the Judicial Council and Utah State Bar taking a neutral position. They promised to “work with our chambers to determine the best path forward.”
Ultimately, however, they opted not to override. 
Another controversial bill that Cox vetoed was SB37, which would have rerouted property tax revenue for schools into the state’s general fund. Education leaders opposed the bill, arguing it would be a form of “money laundering” that could divert money away from education. 
Cox, at the time of his veto, said it was a matter of “public trust,” accounting problems, legal issues and sending the wrong message to educators about Utah’s commitment to public education. 
Then, on the last night he had to either sign or veto bills passed during the legislative session, Cox vetoed four more bills, including: 

SB197, a bill that would have phased out the state’s Circuit Breaker property tax relief program for low-income seniors and indigent residents. Cox argued that the bill, while having “well-intentioned goals of reforming and streamlining property tax relief programs,” would risk “cutting off the most vulnerable of Utah’s” growing senior population while saddling counties with administrative burdens. 
HB306, a bill that would have made Utah the first state in the country to allow vendors to receive payment in gold or silver from the state. Cox expressed concerns that the bill faced problems that made it “operationally impracticable.” Plus, he worried that a “specific entity offered to fund the bill, which could jeopardize the required competitive process in the bill.” Cox didn’t name the entity in his veto letter, but The Salt Lake Tribune reported that in order to get the state’s new transaction system up and running, about $147,000 would be paid for by private donors, and Ivory said the money would come from Kevin Freeman, who was a member of the state’s gold working group and author of the 2023 book “Pirate Money.”
HB315, a bill that would have allowed breaking a tie among three or more candidates in elections for midterm vacancies in municipal offices through a “game of chance.” Cox pointed to language in the Utah Constitution that explicitly prohibits the Legislature from authorizing “any game of chance.” Cox said he vetoed the bill “out of an abundance of caution to avoid creating potential legal issues.” 
SB106, a bill to appropriate $10,000 to create a trade commission between Utah and Ireland composed of six legislators and five appointees from the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity. Cox said he was wary of creating more boards and commissions in statute, urging lawmakers to “not go backward” on their efforts to reduce the number of boards and commissions below 400. He also expressed concerns about creating a trade commission for a specific country when others, which are more significant trade partners for the state, don’t receive the same treatment. 

Though legislative leaders announced they won’t be convening a veto override session, there’s still a likelihood that the Legislature will convene a special session in coming weeks. 
Utah Gov. Cox vetoes bill to reroute property tax revenue for schools into state general fund

Cox has indicated that he intends to call a special session sometime in May. In his veto letter, he said he’d signed several bills “with the understanding that they will be amended in a special session.” 
Those included HB263, a bill focused on election transparency that county clerks had urged Cox to veto, but the governor wrote the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, had “reached an agreement” with election officials to make some “important changes.” 
Cox also agreed to sign HB356, a bill requiring some counties to elect district-based council members rather than at-large members, but with the expectation that lawmakers would make changes in a special session to avoid “unintended consequences,” although he did not specify what those might be.
During that special session, Cox also said he wants the Legislature to repurpose $3.5 million it had set aside as part of Utah’s bid to keep the Sundance Film Festival, which opted instead to move to Colorado.
“Again, more to come soon in a special session,” Cox wrote. 
That special session call, however, has not yet been announced. A request for comment to the governor’s office was not immediately returned Thursday afternoon.

This story was originally reported by Orion Rummler of The 19th.  Meet Orion and read more of his reporting on gender, politics and policy.
On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a 400-page analysis of research on gender-affirming care for transgender youth, as directed by President Donald Trump. The agency used the release of the report to declare that available science does not support providing gender-affirming care to trans youth. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups worry the report will be used to further restrict gender-affirming care and to change medical guidelines in ways that harm trans youth.
The president mandated the report in an executive order condemning the medical treatment — without evidence — as a form of mutilation, amid a broader push by the administration to exclude trans people from public life. Trump’s order asked the health agency to review the “best practices for promoting the health of children who assert gender dysphoria,” while pressuring youth clinics to halt treatment or lose federal funding.
Now, the HHS has produced that report. The agency combed through research on the outcomes of puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy, social transition, psychotherapy, and the rare cases of surgeries on adolescents and young adults diagnosed with gender dysphoria.
Gender dysphoria, the reason that most trans people undergo gender-affirming care, is a strong and persistent distress felt when one’s body is out of sync with their gender identity. Without treatment, gender dysphoria can lead to severe negative impacts in day-to-day life.
The agency states in its executive summary of the report that the document is not meant to provide clinical practice guidelines or issue legislative or policy recommendations. However, the report does imply that health care providers should refuse to offer gender-affirming care to adolescents and young adults on the basis that such care comes with the potential for risk — despite little evidence for that risk actually being found in the report.
“The evidence for benefit of pediatric medical transition is very uncertain, while the evidence for harm is less uncertain,” the executive summary states. “When medical interventions pose unnecessary, disproportionate risks of harm, healthcare providers should refuse to offer them even when they are preferred, requested, or demanded by patients.”
In its research review, the HHS determined that evidence measuring the effects of gender-affirming care on psychological outcomes, quality of life, regret and long-term health is of “very low” quality. This conclusion ignores decades of research, as well as a recent survey of more than 90,000 transgender people in the United States that found an overwhelming majority report more life satisfaction after having transitioned. Access to gender-affirming care has been linked to lower odds of suicidality and depression in trans youth, while gender-affirming surgeries have been found to lower psychological distress for adults.
Even when analyzing research that the administration deemed low-bias, the HHS found “sparse” to no evidence of harm from gender-affirming care. What’s more, the report frequently found evidence demonstrating the benefits of gender-affirming care — though it ultimately downplays those findings as not significant.
Available research on puberty blockers found high satisfaction ratings and low rates of regret. A systematic review of hormone replacement therapy described improved gender dysphoria and body satisfaction. Another found that hormone treatment leads to improved mental health. Two before-and-after studies reported reduced treatment needs or lower levels of suicidality and self-harm after hormone treatment. When measuring safety outcomes of hormone treatment, side effects did not have a major impact on treatment and complications were limited.
Despite these findings, the Department of Health and Human Services advertised the report in a Thursday news release as one that “highlights a growing body of evidence pointing to significant risks” of gender-affirming care. At the White House briefing room Thursday, deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller touted the new report and attributed the idea of being transgender as part of a “cancerous communist woke culture” that is “destroying this country.”
There are side effects to many of the medications that transgender people — and cisgender people — take to receive gender-affirming care, as is the case with most medical treatments. These side effects, like the risk of decreased bone density when taking puberty blockers, are closely monitored and treated by doctors and communicated to patients.
LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations denounced the report as a political attack on transgender youth. Multiple groups said that the report’s endorsement of psychotherapy as a “noninvasive alternative” to puberty blockers and hormone treatment amounts to an endorsement of conversion therapy — a practice wherein mental health professionals try to change a youth’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
“It is already clear that this report is a willful distortion of the evidence intended to stoke fear about a field of safe and effective medicine that has existed for decades, in order to justify dangerous practices which amount to conversion therapy,” said Sinead Murano Kinney, health policy analyst at Advocates for Trans Equality.
The Human Rights Campaign, the country’s largest LGBTQ+ rights organization, accused the HHS of producing a report that is attempting to lay the groundwork to replace medical care for trans and nonbinary people with conversion therapy.
“Trans people are who we are. We’re born this way. And we deserve to live our best lives and have a fair shot and equal opportunity at living a good life,” said Jay Brown, chief of staff at the Human Rights Campaign. “This report … lays the groundwork to push parents and doctors aside and allow politicians to subject our kids to the debunked practice of conversion therapy.”
No authors or contributors are named in the report or in its executive summary. The agency says these names are being initially withheld to “maintain the integrity of this process,” and states that chapters of the document were subject to peer review.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/transyouth-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-05-01 16:08:46.601294

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)When Big Pharma lobbyists came to the Rhode Island State House April 10 to oppose legislation that would hurt drugmakers’ profits, Woonsocket independent Rep. Jon D. Brien was ready for them.
Brien, the sole independent in the 75 seats of the House of Representatives, was there to introduce his bill that would shield a federal drug pricing mandate from manufacturer intervention. 
“They’ve come from far away to tell you, ‘The sky shall fall in the state of Rhode Island if you pass this legislation,’” Brien told the House Committee on Health and Human Services. “And I assure you … it will not.” 
H5634 aims to stop drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from controlling patient access to discounted prescription drugs under the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Congress created the program in 1992 to help safety net clinics and hospitals “stretch scarce federal resources as far as possible,” according to program overseer, the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). 
Under 340B, providers buy drugs from manufacturers or wholesalers at a federally set minimum discount of 23.1% off the average retail price, although the discount for providers is typically 25% to 50%. Providers are then reimbursed for the drug’s standard price by insurers, and the clinic’s savings are reinvested in more patient services. 
The feds don’t pay the difference — the manufacturer eats the discount. Drugmakers continue to participate so they can have their drugs covered by Medicaid and Medicare, but some have recently tried to block providers from contracting with multiple pharmacies to fill 340B prescriptions. Outsourcing dispensing, manufacturers argue, is the latest example of how providers are profiting off a system designed to reduce customer costs for outpatient drugs.
“This legislature needs to fight back,” Brien told the committee. “Pharmacy benefit managers, insurers and drug manufacturers are bleeding our safety net providers dry with discriminatory, profit-driven tactics. They’re slashing reimbursements, clawing back funds, and steering prescriptions to their own pharmacies, crippling health centers and hospitals that serve our most vulnerable residents.” 
When Rhode Island Current caught up with Brien a week later, he remained firm on his bill’s importance for protecting Rhode Islanders.
“Who are we going to prioritize this legislative session: Big Pharma or the people of Rhode Island?” Brien asked. “It’ll be hard to go back to them and tell them why this didn’t pass, because I sure as hell am not going to sugarcoat it if it doesn’t.”
He was glad to see testimony supporting the legislation far outweigh opposition at the hearing. The bill was held for further study, which happens to every bill upon its debut. But what makes Brien’s bill unique is the list of strange bedfellows backing it. Co-sponsors include two Republicans, Reps. Marie Hopkins of Warwick and David Place of Burrillville, and two Democrats, Reps. Megan Cotter of Exeter and Jacquelyn Baginski of Cranston —  a rare show of tripartisan teamwork.
“Without question, the most consensus building piece of legislation that I’ve ever submitted,” Brien tweeted about the bill on April 29. 
Brien, who sports an image of Tulsi Gabbard being sworn in as director of national intelligence as his X header, won his House District 49 seat in 2022. Like Gabbard, Brien was once a Democrat. An attorney who specializes in personal injury, criminal defense and DUIs, Brien held the Rhode Island House District 50 seat from 2007 to 2013 when he lived in Woonsocket’s Globe District, before moving to the city’s North End. (The District 50 seat now belongs to Democratic Rep. Stephen Casey.) 
“We are all of vast and varying ideologies, but we all believe the same thing,” Brien said over the phone. “And the same thing is we got to get this bill passed.”

Last year, Brien introduced the same legislation, which died in committee. It’s why Cotter, whose western, rural Rhode Island district spans 100 square miles of Richmond and most of Exeter, sought him out this year. Brien’s bill, she said, could help local health clinics survive, especially those in the state’s rural and underserved areas.          
“This bill could be the difference between some of them staying open and some of closing,” Cotter said.
Across the rotunda, however, the Senate version of the bill remains firmly partisan. S0114, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Bridget Valverde of North Kingstown alongside seven Democrats, most of them progressives, was held for further study after its hearing on March 20. 
Patients ‘not driving to Chepachet’
Brien’s fight for 340B comes from his own backyard. Thundermist Health Center in downtown Woonsocket in Brien’s district is a federally qualified health center which serves over 63,000 patients annually, including low-income and uninsured people, and it participates in the 340B program. It then reinvests the savings into other services, like an onsite food bank.
Last year, Thundermist had to lay off 130 workers and eliminate its tobacco cessation program after losing roughly $5.6 million in 340B revenue, Matthew Roman, the center’s chief operating officer, told the House committee. The loss came even after Thundermist worked with a national firm to recover maximum revenue from the program. 
Thundermist staff said the patient experience has been affected by moves by manufacturers to refuse or heavily limit shipments of 340B discounted products to multiple pharmacies — a not uncommon request for providers, who will contract with multiple pharmacies so patients can fill their medicines closer to home. Some Thundermist patients now have to visit different pharmacies depending on which manufacturer made their medication, Chris Durigan, the health center’s director of clinical pharmacy services, told lawmakers at the hearing.
Peter Bancroft, CEO of WellOne Primary Medical and Dental Care which has four locations in Rhode Island, shared a similar story. About a year and a half ago, WellOne used to subsidize about 40,000 $5 prescriptions monthly in its discount program. Now, the center is writing around 10,000 of those prescriptions a month, because of manufacturer restrictions that steer the discounted drugs toward one pharmacy.
“We had to pick one that was quote, unquote ‘centralized,’” Bancroft said. “Well, if you think there’s a central pharmacy between Burrillville and North Kingstown and Scituate and Foster. We ended up going to the pharmacy in Chepachet. Our patients from North Kingstown are not driving to Chepachet to get their $5 prescription.”
Other community health clinics offered testimony in support of Brien’s and Valverde’s bills. Providence Community Health Centers lost $9 million in 340B revenue in four years. WellOne faces a $2.1 million deficit in fiscal year 2025, with $1.7 million tied directly to lost 340B earnings. Wood River Health, which has three locations across the state, reported a $1 million loss in revenue over two years.
CharterCARE doesn’t yet benefit from 340B at its for-profit, safety net hospitals, but it wants the program intact as its properties — Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence and Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence — transition to nonprofit, 340B-eligible status after a protracted but soon-to-be-concluded change in ownership. Jeffrey Dandurand, the health system’s pharmacy director, submitted written testimony that “a key aspect of our strategic transition plan…is dependent on participation in the 340B program.” 
The Hospital Association of Rhode Island supports the legislation and submitted written testimony, and the town of Burrillville passed a resolution in support.

A hospital is not a clinic
Pharmaceutical manufacturers, however, are unhappy with the use of contract pharmacies, which can be any third-party drugstore including chains like CVS and Walgreens. In 2010, HRSA allowed providers to use unlimited contract pharmacies, fostering abundant growth. Since then, the number of contract pharmacies has grown 12,000%, and there were more than 200,000 contract pharmacy agreements inked between 2013 and 2024 — numbers that come from a report funded by PhRMA, a major pharmaceutical lobbying and trade group.
Brien’s Republican co-sponsors on the House health committee were unmoved by the arguments of Brian Jordan, a lobbyist for PhRMA, that the root issue of 340B’s problems “always goes back to low Medicaid reimbursement.” 
“It almost sounds like you just don’t like the program, and you’re trying to restrict the program as much as possible,” said Rep. David Place of Burrillville.
First-term Rep. Marie Hopkins of Warwick dug into Jordan’s assertion that facilities are using 340B for profit. These are places already operating on “shoestring” budgets, she offered, and 340B is a way to recoup costs.
“It’s not how the program was originally intended,” Jordan said. “I mean, it’s a revenue source. Why not increase the sales tax, something like that?”
“When I go to the mechanic, and I pay the $299 for tires, I know that he got them for $100,” Hopkins said. “But there is a cost associated with his providing the service. That’s how business works. I see this the same way, and you’re trying to scoop out their revenue source.”
Hopkins’ arguments echoed those of hospital trade groups, like a 2024 American Hospital Association report that cited a $30 billion growth in the 340B program over five years, while the drug market grew $330 billion in that same time. Other sources like the Drug Channels Institute analyzed HRSA data to show that the 340B program grew $12.6 billion in a single year, accounting for $66 billion overall revenue in 2023.
“Everyone in the drug channel — hospitals, federal grantees, PBMs, pharmacies, plan sponsors, employers, insurers, wholesalers, technology vendors, consultants, and more — profits from the billions of 340B dollars that are sloshing around the system,” the institute’s founder Adam J. Fein wrote in 2024.
PhRMA’s Jordan and Rep. Hopkins did agree there should be more rigorous oversight of 340B. As drafted, the Rhode Island legislation does not permit audits beyond those already performed by the federal government. Cara Sammartino, an associate professor at Johnson & Wales who chairs the school’s public health program, urged lawmakers in written testimony to strike that clause, as vagueness in federal audit laws allows 340B entities to audit themselves or hire contractors to do it.  










When I go to the mechanic, and I pay the $299 for tires, I know that he got them for $100. But there is a cost associated with his providing the service. That’s how business works. I see this the same way, and you’re trying to scoop out their revenue source.


– Rep. Marie Hopkins, a Warwick Republican, to a pharmaceutical lobbyist a House committee hearing


Brien told Rhode Island Current the idea that 340B providers aren’t audited is an industry “red herring…All the legislation says is that these institutions can’t be audited more than the federal government requires them to be.”
In 2023, Minnesota became the first state to require annual reporting from 340B entities. A 2024 report found that 13% of providers — mostly large hospitals — earned 80% of 340B revenue, while safety net clinics earned the least. Meanwhile, $120 million went to contract pharmacies and third-party administrators, echoing drugmakers’ assertions that the program is lucrative. 
Similarly, a 2021 white paper by the Schaeffer Institute for Public Policy & Government Service found that hospitals represented 60% of 340B sites in 2020. Unlike non-hospital entities covered by the program, 340B hospitals “are not required to use 340B savings to serve vulnerable populations, nor are they required to report how 340B revenues are used,” according to the report.
Johns Hopkins University Professor of Accounting Ge Bai wrote in a 2023 testimony before a U.S. Congressional subcommittee that “many tax-exempt hospitals have been deviating from their original charitable pursuits to focus on expanding their market share and enhancing profitability,” a motive that also includes 340B, since “eligible tax-exempt hospitals…can generate substantial profits by providing these drugs to well insured patients,” Bai wrote.
Asked about the Rhode Island bill, Bai said over email, “The bill, if passed, would represent a win for 340B hospitals in RI and a loss for pharmaceutical companies.”
But, she added, “the scale of the 340B program has been ballooning.” She pointed to an April 15 executive order from President Donald Trump likely to affect the program by requiring greater oversight and regulation of Medicare and Medicaid payments for drugs.

Pharma vs. everyone
Brien and Valverde want Rhode Island to follow in the footsteps of 33 states that have passed laws to defend contract pharmacy use or prohibit PBM discrimination against 340B entities. The legislation has invoked both specific legal challenges and broader ones. Judges in the D.C. and Third Circuits ruled that the 340B statute says nothing about where or how drugs must be dispensed — ultimately a blow against contract pharmacies. 
Conversely, it seemed as if the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would resume the course set for HRSA under the Biden administration when, in March, HRSA continued litigation over drugmakers’ Medicaid contracts if they offered alternative rebates in violation of 340B. An HHS spokesperson said via email that the agency does not comment on ongoing litigation, and would not provide an on-record comment about the future of the 340B program. 
States have already been sued for trying to enshrine 340B protections, Brien said at the hearing, and some emerged victorious. The possibility of defeat in court was not enough to deter Brien. He cited lawsuits against  proposals for truck tolls and high-capacity magazine bans filed before the relevant bills even hit the House or Senate floor.  
Brien asked his colleagues: “Since when does this institution not pass legislation for fear of a lawsuit?”
Over the phone, Brien remained hopeful. 
“I intend to do a full court press on this thing. It’s my number one priority. It’s the number one priority of a number of legislators,” he said. “It comes down to, ‘Will leadership stand with Big Pharma or the people of Rhode Island?’”

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)More than 600 Maine lawyers signed a declaration urging others in the profession, the government and the public to reject attempts to intimidate or penalize those working in the legal system for representing interests that do not align with the views of the current administration. 
While “Law Day” occurs every year, 100 Maine law firms and 633 Maine lawyers used the occasion on Thursday to publicly renew their commitment to the Constitution by signing the statement.
The declaration is specific to Maine, but hundreds of people also gathered in Portland outside the Cumberland County Courthouse to reaffirm the oath those in the legal profession take to uphold the rule of law, which was one of nearly 50 such events across the country. 
“We categorically reject the idea that any government can dictate who lawyers or law firms can choose to represent,” said Maine State Bar Association President Susan Faunce, “and we reject the dangerous notion that judges should be punished or threatened for doing their jobs in rendering decisions according to the law and the facts.” 
Faunce and other leaders of Maine’s legal community used speeches to criticize the Trump administration for defying court orders and targeting prominent law firms with executive orders punishing them — such as stripping their lawyers’ security clearances and barring access to federal buildings — for employing people or pursuing cases the president dislikes.
Attorney General Aaron Frey commended the firms that have fought back but warned of the precedent set by those that have caved, agreeing to provide free legal services for causes the Trump administration supports to avoid the sanctions. 
“While I regret that they have been targeted and they felt that this was the way that they had to go,” Frey said, “let me just caution that by bending the knee to an illegal executive order, they are legitimizing this unlawful attack on their profession.”
Frey outlined the steps he said he’s taken to be a good steward of the law, such as bringing suit against the Trump administration for imposing tariffs without the approval of Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture halting federal funds because Maine allows transgender athletes to compete in girls’ sports.

During the event, speakers made their opposition to Trump’s specific actions clear, but the written declaration does not mention the president by name. 
Former Public Advocate Bill Harwood, who helped organize the event, told Maine Morning Star the group did not want the declaration to be a stance on any issues but instead to be narrowly focused on the independence of the legal system that settles the issues.  
“To get lawyers to agree on anything, as people know, is hard work,” Harwood said, “so we’re very proud of the declaration.”
While the declaration and event are symbolic, Harwood said they are reminders that everyone’s rights and liberties are dependent on the backing of an independent legal system. 
“The idea that a law firm has to give up hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal services to the administration’s allies and supporters in order not to be sanctioned with the loss of rights and access to federal documents is just unheard of,” Harwood said. 
Those who attended the event on Thursday said they felt compelled to add to the show of force, which included former Chief Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court Daniel Wathen, who headed the state commission that investigated the Lewiston mass shooting, reading the Maine attorney’s oath and those in attendance repeating it back.
“It takes more than lawyers,” Portland resident Emily Miller said, “and they need to know we support them.”
While not in attendance at the rally, Gov. Janet Mills issued a proclamation declaring Thursday as “Law Day” throughout Maine, in which she called back to the proclamation made by President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he designed the first Law Day in 1958. 
Eisenhower said then that America’s protection of equal rights under the law “distinguishes our governmental system from the type of government that rules by might alone,” Mills said in a statement, in which she then added her own vow: “On Law Day, and every day, I urge all Maine people to join with me in standing up to protect the rule of law.”
In Portland, Barbara Cray, representing Lawyers for Good Government and dressed in suffragette white, said the rally adhered to the day’s founding purpose. She said she hoped the action showed judges they are supported in making decisions under the law and not under threat.
But, Cray also took the opportunity to knock the other branch of government for what she criticized as providing an inadequate backstop against the executive branch. 
“We, unfortunately, have a Congress which is just stalled in craziness,” Cray said. 
When asked whether the day of action was also targeted at Maine’s lawmakers in Washington, D.C., Harwood said it was intended as a call on everyone, including Congress as well as the Maine Legislature.
“We need all of us, obviously we need our congressional delegation, to recognize that when we have this constitutional crisis — and I don’t think that’s too strong a word — that we need to have them stand up,” Harwood said.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A day after the Senate unanimously approved a proposal to prevent development in state parks, the House followed with a similar unanimous vote on Thursday, sending the bill to the governor in a big win for environmentalists and all those who enjoy recreating in any of the 175 state parks in Florida.
The measure (HB 209) makes a number of changes to state law to prevent what happened last August — that’s when a former Department of Environmental Protection employee leaked to the Tampa Bay Times information about the state’s plan to build golf courses, hotels, pickleball courts, and more at nine state parks.
That led to an uproar from citizens up and down Florida, with protests taking place outside those state parks, leading state officials to drop the plan.
The measure voted on by lawmakers on Thursday prohibits construction of specified sporting facilities and public lodgings in state parks, such as golf courses, tennis courts, pickleball courts, and ball fields.
The Florida chapter of the Sierra Club.welcomed the unanimous votes in both chambers.
“Since last summer, Sierra Club Florida and its members have been on the front lines fighting to keep development out of our state parks,” said Javier Estevez, the Sierra Club’s Florida political and legislative director.
“From rallies and protests, to delegation meetings, district visits, our State Park Love Fests, and Lobby Day — we made our voices impossible to ignore. The Florida Legislature heard us loud and clear. And today, we can proudly say: WE WON!”
“It’s a great bill to take back home and let the people know that we put real plans in place to make sure that, for generations to come, our state parks will be preserved,” said Southeast Republican Rep. John Snyder, co-sponsor of the House bill. “They will be protected. They will be here for millions of Floridians and visitors from around the world to come and enjoy.”

At least 1,024 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in March and April, according to a review by The Associated Press.
The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is a database used to track and monitor schools, exchange visitor programs and certain designations of nonimmigrants while they study in the U.S. education system, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The terminations of records in the database were challenged in more than 70 lawsuits across the country. The federal government reversed course on Friday, April 25, when a government attorney announced in a hearing that students’ terminated records would be restored while the government adopts a formal policy for revoking records in SEVIS.
John Thomas, the UA’s director of media relations and core communications, said Thursday that all five students who had their SEVIS records terminated have now been restored to active status.
“We learned that the students’ SEVIS records had been reinstated over the course of a few days starting last week,” Thomas said. 
UA officials have not identified the students or stated why their status was revoked. The university had 1,214 foreign students as of April 25, according to a Spring 2025 enrollment report.
An internal memo filed in court by the Justice Department Monday indicates an expansion of power for ICE regarding international students’ legal status, NBC News reported. 
The memo to all Student and Exchange Visitor Program personnel shows an expanded list of criteria for ICE to terminate international students’ status. According to the document, visa revocation would now be grounds for terminating students’ status.

Kelly Armstrong on Thursday signed a bill that prevents K-12 public schools from having all-gender bathrooms. It allows parents to file complaints if they think their child’s school is not following state laws governing accommodations for transgender students.
House Bill 1144 updates a law adopted in 2023 that prevents transgender students from using bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender.
It also bars schools and teachers from requiring or prohibiting someone to use students’ preferred pronouns. On top of this, the law requires schools and teachers to tell a child’s parents if they learn the child is transgender.
North Dakota Senate approves bathroom bill that would fine schools for noncompliance

House Bill 1144 is meant to give teeth to that law by adding legal penalties. Some lawmakers said they believed schools would not follow the policy without the threat of consequences.
The bill “reinforces the message that our laws are not arbitrary or without meaning,” said Sen. Randy Lemm, R-Hillsboro, who spoke in favor of the bill on the Senate Floor.
Concerned parents who believe their school is not following the law may now file a complaint with their school district. If they aren’t satisfied with the school district’s response, they can take the issue up with the North Dakota Attorney General’s Office.
Courts that find a school has broken the law can issue fines of up to $2,500 per violation.
The amended law also states that any multi-stall bathroom or shower room must be designated exclusively for boys or girls. Multi-stall bathrooms or shower rooms cannot be unisex. In response to concerns that the law would force some school districts to spend millions renovating their bathroom, lawmakers added a provision that exempts restrooms created before July 1, 2025 from the policy.
Bathroom bill would make schools less safe, opponents, LGBTQ advocates testify

In a conference committee, legislators also added two other exemptions to the law. One makes sure the law doesn’t prevent students with developmental disabilities from getting bathroom assistance from paraprofessionals if needed. 
The other gives schools the ability to temporarily change designation from one sex to another to accommodate school-sponsored events. This could allow a visiting girls sports teams to use a locker room for boys, for example.
Both chambers on Monday approved the amended bill. The House approved the policy by a vote of 75-14; and the Senate, by a vote of 40-7. The new law went into effect immediately after it was signed.
Armstrong last week also signed into law House Bill 1181, which amends Century Code to state “words used to reference an individual’s gender mean the individual’s sex.”
The bill’s sponsor, SuAnn Olson, R-Baldwin, previously called it a “common sense” proposal that is “scientifically honest.” 
Olson said the bill was meant to bring North Dakota into compliance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in January establishing a two-gender policy for the federal government.
Opponents of the policy criticized it as discriminatory to transgender and intersex North Dakotans.

The program is possible because of an increase to the state’s 911 surcharge lawmakers approved in recent years, board members said.
The monthly, per-line charge applies to landline and cellphone service, and is used to help local governments fund their 911 call centers. Legislators and then-Gov. Kristi Noem adopted a 75-cent increase in the surcharge last year, from $1.25 to $2. Lawmakers and Gov. Larry Rhoden made the increase permanent this year.
Before last year, lawmakers had not increased the surcharge since 2012, and it was supporting only 30% of local call centers’ operational costs while local governments funded the rest, said Jason Husby, the state’s 911 coordinator. He told board members the increased surcharge is covering about 45% of those costs.
Rhoden signs bills including school cash mandate, Mickelson Trail e-bike limitation, 911 surcharge

Seventy percent of revenue from the surcharge is remitted to the local agency where the surcharge was collected, and 30% is deposited into the 911 coordination fund overseen by the state Department of Public Safety.
The increase raised the state’s surcharge revenue from $2.8 million in fiscal year 2024 to $3.1 million in fiscal year 2025. Husby told board members that some of those extra funds can go toward creating a continuous grant program for 911 call centers to make necessary improvements. Considering other costs paid by the coordination fund, he said it’ll leave about $80,000 a month to use for call center grants.
South Dakota is ahead of other states regarding its 911 infrastructure, Husby said. The state set up redundancies in case a call center is offline or overwhelmed, rerouting incoming calls to the nearest dispatcher. That redundancy was used during statewide 911 outages in April and July last year.
The next step is to extend that redundancy and coordination to emergency responders through improved radio networks. The improvement was recommended in the state’s 911 efficiency study, published in January.
Board member and Watertown Police Chief Tim Toomey said the surcharge increase was a “lifesaver” for his local 911 call center. The agency was “hundreds of thousands of dollars in a deficit,” and the surcharge increase for the locality is filling in the gap.
But technology replacement costs, such as radio equipment, are “staggering” to the point “that our city cannot even fathom a budget for that,” Toomey said, requiring additional support.
The grants can also be used to facilitate consolidation among several call centers currently discussing the matter, Husby said.
“There are upfront costs if County A and County B want to combine, and I would hate for those upfront costs to dissuade what would be an eventual efficiency,” Husby said. “To me, that’s where I see the board come in to fund and review the cost to move radios, technology and all the things together. We can help those governments and, in the end, they’re becoming more efficient.”
The board unanimously approved of the grant program. Husby hopes to move the program forward quickly to assist call centers “in desperate need” of radio updates. He said he’ll provide a more detailed plan at the board’s next meeting in June.

As a teenager growing up in the city, Sobocinski started a subscription service of sorts for his neighbors. They would pay him around $20 a week, and he would deliver homemade loaves of bread and quarts of soup to a cooler outside of their houses. Within a month, he had gone from having five or six customers to over 40. 
“I had taken over the entire kitchen, and my mom was like, ‘This ends now. Like, we can’t even cook,’” Sobocinski told The Connecticut Mirror’s Erica E. Phillips on Wednesday night. “I had batches of soup going and bread everywhere. I had emptied the entire refrigerator and thrown out all of their food just so I could put bread in there and let it ferment.”
Sobocinski and Phillips discussed his career at the Ferguson Library in Stamford during the third installment of CT Mirror’s “This Could Work” event series, which explores the stories of successful Connecticut entrepreneurs. 
Over time, Sobocinski parlayed that love of food and self-starter spirit into a career as a food and beverage entrepreneur, with restaurants and shops based largely in his home city.
He was behind New Haven’s cheese-focused Caseus Fromagerie & Bistro and Olmo bagel shop, as well as Black Hog Brewing in Oxford. His newest venture, Haven Hot Chicken, was recently named by Inc. Magazine as one of the fastest-growing companies in the United States.
In Sobocinski’s case, his origin story revolved around a series of jobs in restaurants and gourmet grocery stores. Among them was Formaggio Kitchen, a gourmet cheese shop in Boston where he worked while pursuing a graduate degree in gastronomy — which he describes as “the anthropological study of food and culture” — from Boston University.
With family roots pulling him back to New Haven, and his work at Formaggio Kitchen fresh in his mind, Sobocinski moved back home and opened Caseus Fromagerie & Bistro, a cheese shop and restaurant in New Haven.
Caseus opened in 2008, and to hear Sobocinski tell it, the timing wasn’t ideal, as people didn’t want to buy cheese that could cost up to $35 per pound in the midst of a deepening recession.
During that time, the Caseus crew stuck it out — “we innovated, we just got scrappy,” Sobocinski said — and the shop remained open until 2018, when Sobocinski decided to close it to make room for a new venture in the same location. 
That venture was Olmo, a bagel shop that looks markedly different from the vision he and Craig Hutchinson, his former head chef at Caseus, originally had for it.
In addition to a bagel shop, the initial vision also involved high-end, new-style Italian food — pasta made by hand, a restaurant where chefs cooked in front of people. But after it opened, Sobocinski said, the feedback he and Hutchinson received was negative. People didn’t like Olmo, and they wanted Caseus back. 
But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, everything changed, and Sobocinski and Hutchinson pivoted. They closed the restaurant portion of Olmo and reinvented their bagel formula, and all of a sudden, Sobocinski said, they went from selling around 50 bagels a day to thousands.
“We had to pivot. It’s an opportunity,” Sobocinski said. “You can think of it as the worst thing ever, and it was terrible, or you can make it into an opportunity. Because that’s what failure is. It’s truly an opportunity.”
Sobocinski is now CEO of Haven Hot Chicken, which has brought Nashville-style Hot Chicken to New England and offers five levels of heat that guests can try. Haven has been growing since its founding in 2020, and now boasts nine locations throughout Connecticut, from Norwalk to Newington to Storrs.
He describes Haven as offering a healthier version of fried chicken, one that was raised with no antibiotics and is fried in canola oil rather than the cheaper, but unhealthier, soybean oil that many other restaurants use. He thinks of Haven Hot Chicken as a premium choice.
“I can’t compete with the big guys, nor do I want to, because that will be a race to the bottom,” Sobocinski said. “And so we’re more expensive, and you get something for it. And that’s OK.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/April-30-2025-TCW-photo-by-Robert-DiGioia-3-1024x660.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 16:08:46.601294

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire House passed a bill Thursday to prevent cities and towns from requiring more than one parking space per housing unit, a move intended to ease burdens on developers and encourage more housing. 
But in passing the bill, the House made some changes that could create a tussle with the Senate.
Under current law, municipalities are capped at requiring 1.5 parking spaces per unit, or three for every two units. 
As originally introduced by Sen. Keith Murphy, a Manchester Republican, Senate Bill 284 limited municipalities from mandating more than one parking space but included some exceptions. For developments containing 10 units or more, or for one-bedroom and studio apartments that qualify as workforce housing, cities and towns could continue requiring 1.5 parking spaces. 
In April, the House Housing Committee proposed an amendment to Murphy’s bill that would remove those exceptions, limiting all municipal parking minimums to one spot per unit. 
Housing advocates say parking requirements can hamper and even prevent some housing projects from moving forward, by raising costs and creating some logistical barriers. Opponents to the bill, such as the New Hampshire Municipal Association, argue cities and towns should have the flexibility to require parking minimums for housing developments in order to reduce the strain on other parking options in town.
Rep. Joe Alexander, the chairman of the House Housing Committee, said the House’s version was a better way to encourage the market to produce housing. 
“The majority of the committee believes that the free market is the best determinant of what sufficient parking is needed for each residential unit and property owners are the best decision-makers when it comes to how much parking is necessary for their property,” Alexander wrote in an explanation in the House calendar. “This bill as amended still allows municipalities to regulate parking up to one space per unit.” 
The bill was recommended by the Housing Committee 14-1, and passed the House 197-144.
“The state is imposing a one-size-fits-all mandate that may not reflect local realities, such as geography, population density, public transit availability, or tourism demands,” said Rep. Kim Rice, a Hudson Republican. “What works in a compact urban area like Portsmouth may be entirely unworkable in the rural town with limited transportation alternatives.”
Rice said the requirements could affect residents elsewhere who might not have access to parking, and could lead to “poorly planned developments.” 
The bill will now head back to the Senate, which must vote on whether to accept the House’s changes, reject them and kill the bill, or move to a committee of conference with the House to try to negotiate.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/parkingsign-1024x671.jpg,,,2025-05-01 16:08:46.601294

Iowa Board of Medicine records indicate Dr. Dale M. Grunewald, 80, has been charged with professional incompetence related to inappropriate pain management.
The board has not disclosed the underlying allegations that form the basis of the charge, and there’s no indication when, where or how the alleged conduct took place.
However, board records indicate the action is tied to four separate complaints or cases investigated by the board. Those cases were initiated in 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2020.
A two-day hearing on the charge is scheduled for June 2026 – which is eight months after Grunewald’s current license is scheduled to expire.
Grunewald was issued an Iowa medical license in September 1974.
State records indicate that in 1992, Grunewald was convicted of three felony counts of income tax evasion, was fined $20,000, ordered to complete 200 hours of community service, and was sentenced to four months in jail followed by four months of home confinement.
The board, then known as the Iowa Board of Medical Examiners, fined Grunewald $3,000 as a result of the conviction and placed his license on indefinite probation. The board also restricted Grunewald’s practice, for 60 days, to working in a free clinic.
In March 1994, the board restored Grunewald’s license to full privileges, free and clear of any restrictions.



Emergency room doctor charged with substance abuse
Dr. Chad W. Becker, an emergency medicine physician who practices in the Des Moines area, has been charged by the Iowa Board of Medicine with substance abuse and practicing in a manner that harmful or detrimental to the public.
The alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges has not been disclosed by the board.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for January 2026. The case against Becker appears to be tied to an investigation the board launched in 2022.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BOARD-OF-MEDICINE.jpg,,,2025-05-01 16:08:46.601294
,DC,2025-05-01 19:15:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Top White House aide defends Trump tariffs, amid plunging consumer sentiment",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/top-white-house-aide-defends-trump-tariffs-amid-plunging-consumer-sentiment,,"WASHINGTON — Despite news that the U.S. economy has contracted since January, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Thursday that President Donald Trump’s policies are working to “unleash this era of American prosperity.”Miller, also a top adviser for Trump on immigration, dismissed fears from the small business community and American consumers when pressed by reporters during the final in a series of press briefings marking Trump’s first 100 days.Questions centered on Trump’s steep 145% tariffs on any goods, including manufacturing parts, imported from China, as well as baseline 10% tariffs on products brought into the U.S. from nearly every other country.Tariffs are an import tax paid to the U.S. government by American companies and individuals who purchase goods from abroad. A broad consensus among economists is that those costs are passed to consumers.When asked what the administration’s end goal is for its trade war with China — the nation now charges 125% tariffs on American products entering its borders — Miller said “we need to have a trade relationship with China that does not do harm to our nation's economic and national security.”“At the same time, tariffs will bring significant revenue into this country that will allow us to pursue our dramatic plan of tax cuts and reforms,” he said, referring to the massive budget reconciliation package underway in the Republican-led House and Senate.Tariff order, then a pauseTrump initially triggered much higher rates on products from major trading partners — for example, 20% on European Union goods and up to 46% on products from Vietnam — but paused them for 90 days at a baseline 10% after investor panic erased trillions from the U.S. stock market. The administration maintains it will have new trade agreements in place by the July deadline.The Institute for Supply Management’s April manufacturing report cited tariff concerns and an “unknown economic environment” for the manufacturing sector’s second month of contraction.Department of Commerce figures released Wednesday showed the U.S. gross domestic product — a country’s total value of goods and services — decreased at an annual rate of 0.3% since January, the first time GDP dipped into the negative since the first quarter of 2022.Meanwhile, U.S. consumer sentiment saw its steepest percentage decline over a three-month period since the 1990 recession, according to the University of Michigan’s April survey of consumers.Tax plansIn response to an inquiry about a U.S. Chamber of Commerce plea for small business tariff relief, Miller said Thursday, “The relief for small businesses is going to come in the form of the largest tax cut in American history.”At the heart of congressional Republicans’ massive budget reconciliation package is the extension of Trump’s 2017 tax law. Wholesale extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is expected to reduce federal revenue by roughly $4.5 trillion over a decade. And, depending on how or if lawmakers pay for the tax cuts, the costs could shrink the economy in the long run, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s analysis of Congressional Budget Office figures.Miller said Trump’s promise to businesses to revive and expand 100% expensing for business investments in the U.S. will make it “the most pro-small business tax bill in American history.”House and Senate Republican leaders have indicated differing timelines for final passage of the tax deal — varying from Memorial Day to July 4.Business community worriesAn April 30 letter from the Chamber of Commerce to the administration warned of ""irreparable harm” to small businesses, even if the administration strikes new tariff agreements over the next weeks or months.“The Chamber is hearing from small business owners every day who are seeing their ability to survive endangered by the recent increase in tariff rates,” the letter stated.Three Republican senators broke with the GOP Wednesday night and voted to rebuke Trump on tariffs. The largely symbolic measure ultimately failed after Republican opposition.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters Tuesday the administration is in conversations with 17 trading partners but would not give any details on talks with China.Economists are now awaiting Friday’s “all-important” jobs report for any further snapshot of U.S. economic health, as Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics wrote Sunday on X.“If payroll jobs increase by 150k, give or take, which is the consensus, all the weak economic data released during the week will be forgotten, at least for a bit. Fingers crossed. If employment increases by less than 100k, watch out,” he wrote.",,,,2025-05-01 16:08:46.601294
,Missouri Independent,2025-05-01 19:12:11+00:00,Missouri Independent,"Missouri paid sick leave law now in effect, though legislative challenges still loom",Clara Bates,,,,,https://missouriindependent.com/2025/05/01/missouri-paid-sick-leave-law-now-in-effect-though-legislative-challenges-still-loom/,"Missouri’s voter-approved paid sick leave law officially went into effect Thursday, allowing thousands of qualified employees to begin accruing paid time off.","Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O'Laughlin said it is a priority of her party to roll back a paid sick leave expansion that was approved by voters in November (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s voter-approved paid sick leave law officially went into effect Thursday, allowing thousands of qualified employees to begin accruing paid time off.
“No Missourian should have to choose between a day’s pay and their family’s well-being,” said Caitlyn Adams, executive director of Missouri Jobs with Justice, which led the campaign for the law, in a press release. “Tens of thousands of Missourians who work full-time do not get any paid sick days, but that changes today.”
But while advocates for the policy celebrated Thursday’s milestone, the new law remains at risk of being overturned by the GOP-dominated Missouri legislature. 
Republicans have vowed to pass legislation rolling back the paid sick leave and modifying an accompanying boost to the minimum wage. That bill has stalled in the face of Democratic opposition, and the legislative session ends May 16. 
Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, has been a particularly loud voice urging repeal of the law.
“Our side of the aisle has great concern for the burden that this would place on businesses,” she told reporters Thursday, “and if we’re going to promote economic growth and jobs, we need to really be cognizant of that.”
Proposition A passed with nearly 58% of the vote in November, garnering support from unions, workers’ advocacy groups, social justice and civil rights groups, as well as over 500 business owners. The measure expanded access to paid sick time for many employees, effective Thursday. It also increased the minimum wage to $15 this year, which went into effect in January, to be adjusted for inflation thereafter. 
Under the law, employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year must now provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours.
“I’m a single mother of four, and I am now able to start earning paid sick for the first time in my life,” said Andi Phillips, a server in Springfield, in the press release.
“I can’t explain how huge of a relief it is that I can now earn time off to better take care of my family and give my kids a better future,” Phillips said. “I never wanted a handout, just an opportunity to be the best version of myself for my kids and now I have that.” 
Missouri Democrats filibuster GOP effort to overturn voter-approved paid sick leave

The Missouri Supreme Court upheld the law earlier this week, dealing a blow to a coalition of business groups who argued the measure violated the single-subject and clear title requirements for ballot measures, and that the fiscal summary was misleading. The Supreme Court found the election results valid. 
The Missouri House passed legislation that would repeal the paid sick leave part of the law and remove the requirement that the minimum wage be indexed to inflation. That bill awaits action in the Senate. 
The Senate Democrats have been in negotiations with Republicans for weeks to modify the bill, in what they’ve said is an effort to maintain the will of the voters in expanding paid sick leave rather than gut it entirely, as well as make it easier for businesses to comply. 
The Republicans could also force the bill through in a rarely-used procedural maneuver known as the previous question, or PQ. That requires the signatures of 10 members of the 34-member Senate and must be approved by a similar majority to shut down debate. It’s use to end a filibuster is seen as a last-resort option by Senate leadership, and the last time the chamber deployed it was eight years ago. 
Senate Minority Leader Sen. Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, told reporters Thursday he doesn’t know whether the two sides will come to an agreement. 
“I would like to see us come to some sort of conclusion, because the law is in effect,” he said. “People are earning sick time, and anything we do at this point could be taking away from people…I’m just saying, I am in good faith negotiations with the other side of the aisle on this and welcome to having those conversations as we continue on. Whether or not we come to a conclusion, I don’t know.”
Speaker of the House Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, told reporters Thursday that modifying the law remains a priority and that he sees action on Prop A as necessary before the legislature can make progress on a bill that seeks to bring businesses to downtown St. Louis. 
“For me, Prop A has to be addressed before we do anything like that,” Patterson said, referring to the bill that seeks to revitalize downtown St. Louis. “…There’s no point to try to attract businesses when you’re telling them with Prop A that it’s going to be very difficult for you, you have these sick leave provisions that can lead to criminal penalties.”
That is an “absurd way to look at Proposition A,” state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, responded to Patterson’s comments. When Missouri workers are successful, she said, businesses will be, too.
“The idea that providing workers with more protections is a business killer is wild,” she said. “…To try to make this seem like this is something that will kill business, that will keep businesses from opening, I think it’s absurd, and I think it’s quite disappointing, and I think it sends absolutely the wrong message.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/051724_olaughlin1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-01 16:08:46.601294

Top Youngkin strategist breaks silence, denies Reid’s extortion claims as GOP feud continues

The audio, obtained and reviewed by The Mercury on Thursday, captures Moran and attorney Tim Anderson, who attended the meeting at the Offices of LINK Public Affairs in Richmond as a witness for Moran, in a conversation with Reid’s campaign manager, Noah Jennings, and Reid’s longtime partner, Alonzo Mable. 
Jennings confirmed in a text message that he was present during the conversation and that the recording is accurate. In response to a request for comment on the recording, Moran didn’t confirm or deny his participation in the conversation but said by text message, “That’s not the full audio.”
The conversation came at the height of a growing crisis inside the Virginia GOP, as party leaders wrestled with how to handle damaging material linked to Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay candidate on a statewide ticket in Virginia history.
In the affidavit Moran released Wednesday, he flatly denied wrongdoing, asserting: “I never attacked John and did not threaten or coerce him. I communicated what I truly believed was in his best interests.” 
On the recording, Moran, the head of Youngkin’s political organization Spirit of Virginia PAC, can be heard explicitly framing Reid’s exit as the only way to stop the release of damaging opposition research.
“If he stays in the race, it is going to continue,” Moran says in the recording. “That hurts our candidates up and down the ticket. Him getting out of the race is the only way it stops, and then, yeah, it absolutely would have to stop. Forevermore after that.”
In a video posted on X after the meeting Sunday afternoon, Reid alleged that Youngkin’s political team told his campaign the attacks would stop only if he withdrew — framing the offer as the kind of pressure that borders on extortion.

Reid’s campaign followed up Monday with a cease-and-desist letter accusing Moran of defamation, asserting that the political consultant had falsely linked him to the explicit Tumblr account — which Reid said he had nothing to do with. 
“While this account shared a common username with our client’s Instagram, he is not and never has been associated with the account,” the letter from Reid’s lawyer Charles Spies stated.
Moran’s affidavit portrays the vulnerability report at the center of the dispute as standard campaign work, saying Reid’s team was fully informed. But the audio reveals Moran and Anderson discussing the need for formal legal agreements to lock down the damaging material.
“So, the worst thing for John is he resigns and he still gets f***ed”,” Anderson says in the recording, adding that any agreement would need to “seal it shut” with an assurance from the governor. Moran agrees, calling it “a reasonable request,” and speculates that Youngkin would commit to ensuring the material never surfaced.
Jennings and Mable, meanwhile, repeatedly asked Moran for documentation, with Moran offering to send a four-page summary and a 16-page report. Moran had previously said Reid’s campaign knew these details.
The emergence of the recording marks another flashpoint in a political storm that has shaken Virginia Republicans for the past week, deepening internal fractures and fueling charges of political backstabbing just months before the November elections.
The controversy began after The Richmonder reported that Youngkin personally called Reid to urge him to drop out, citing concerns over explicit posts shared by a Tumblr account using Reid’s social media username.

For days, Moran stayed silent. Then, on Wednesday evening — less than two hours before Reid took the stage alone at a Henrico County GOP rally where Youngkin canceled his appearance — Moran broke his silence with a public post.
“Let me be clear, facts matter, and they will demonstrate the accusations against me are unfounded,” Moran declared on X.
Moran’s attorney, Terwilliger, followed with a sharply worded letter rejecting Reid’s claims as misinformed, warning that continued accusations could carry legal consequences, and insisting Moran “never attempted to extort, coerce, or pressure Mr. Reid.” The letter also floated the possibility of a private call to resolve the matter.
Several Republican officials, alarmed by the deepening controversy, have publicly called on Youngkin to fire Moran, arguing that the strategist’s continued presence is damaging the party’s credibility and distracting from its November election efforts.
In deepening Va. GOP crisis, Reid accuses Youngkin PAC of extortion. Is a legal battle ahead?

For Moran, 36, the high-stakes fight is the latest chapter in a political career spanning more than a decade. 
He began as a campaign manager and legislative aide before becoming spokesman for then-House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford, and later chief of staff to Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights. 
When Youngkin took office, Moran joined the administration as director of policy and legislative affairs — notably working without a state salary while remaining on leave from his consulting firms, Creative Direct and Link Public Affairs.
Whether the newly surfaced recording leads to legal action or further fractures Virginia’s Republican Party remains to be seen, but it has injected new urgency into a race already engulfed in controversy — and added yet another element to the political storm surrounding Youngkin’s team just months ahead of a critical election.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of KCC's channel)TOPEKA — The Kansas Corporation unanimously issued a $60,000 fine to AT&T for racking up dozens of violations of a state law requiring the marking of its buried infrastructure within two days of requests made by excavating companies operating in Wichita, Olathe, Overland Park, Burrton and Kansas City, Kansas.
KCC staff conducted an investigation of nonresponse tickets submitted by excavators from April 30, 2024, to May 30, 2024, in which AT&T failed to mark underground lines within the allotted time.
A $1,000 fine was attached to each of 60 infractions sited by KCC staff in a report submitted to the state regulatory commission. The company didn’t challenge 60 violations documented by KCC staff, but did contest noncompliance in 20 instances. AT&T asserted the company either performed the utility location work on time or the property in question was cleared because there were no buried utilities in that area.
Kansas law required excavators to provide at least two days notice of intent to dig and utility companies were mandated to mark the underground lines within two days.
The KCC’s chief engineer told the three-member commission Wednesday that AT&T apparently made a decision to save money by not completing in a timely manner a portion of requests submitted to the company for flagging underground utility lines.
“I do think it could possibly be a systemic problem that we need to continue to look into,” said KCC engineer Paul Owings. “This is kind of my opinion, it’s a calculated risk they’re making in terms of locating utilities. Potentially, screening tickets that they view as low risk and saying, ‘It costs X amount to locate. We can screen out whatever percentage — 10, 20, 30% — and save this much money.'”
AT&T didn’t respond to Kansas Reflector’s request for comment about the KCC sanction and the company’s defiance of state statute, the risk posed to public safety and possible impairment of service to customers.
KCC attorney Ahsan Latif said the commission’s staff was concerned any period of time chosen to benchmark AT&T’s compliance with the two-day deadline for marking its underground systems would have resulted in a series of violations. He said AT&T was previously fined for the same problem.
“We’re hoping this gets their attention and spurs action on their part,” Latif said.
He said AT&T indicated noncompliance issues were associated with lack of staffing to meet requests from excavators. Overall, AT&T’s annual net income for 2024 was reported to be $10.7 billion.
During a KCC meeting to consider the latest fine of AT&T, KCC member Dwight Keen said it was concerning the company racked up so many infractions in a short interval.
“I’m taking at face value what they told you (Latif),” Keen said. “I’m still have a problem with it. I’m still thinking, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me.’ AT&T? I just can’t believe it. It really was a risk that they rolled the dice on here. There has to be a level of reasonableness here when some managerial class within this company realizes that they’re throwing caution to the wind.”
Commissioner Annie Kuether said the KCC’s recent assessment of an $8,000 fine against AT&T for failure to timely locate underground systems didn’t deter the company.
“That’s an outrageous number of ignoring the rules,” Kuether said.
Andrew French, chairman of the KCC, urged commission staff to continue monitoring AT&T’s adherence to state law and encouraged KCC staff to propose additional enforcement actions if necessary. He suggested KCC should consider launching a broader investigation of marking compliance across multiple industries.
“We’ve had this issue with other companies, not just AT&T,” French said. “They’re the culprit right now.”

Phil Murphy's proposal would cut millions in aid to community colleges, four-year universities, and student financial assistance programs.","Senators decried proposed cuts to higher education at a May 1 Budget Committee meeting, signaling they could move to restore some funding. (Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)Senate lawmakers on both sides of the aisle signaled Thursday they would seek a reversal of cuts Gov. Phil Murphy’s proposed budget would make to universities, colleges, and the financial assistance to attend them.
The governor’s proposal would cut operational aid to the state’s four-year public universities by $126 million, roll back a $20 million increase in operating aid for community colleges approved last year, and reduce or eliminate tuition assistance for certain students, among numerous other cuts.
“We understand that difficult decisions need to be made in the state budget each year, but we are truly concerned that each year higher education seems to bear a great brunt of these reductions,” said Michael Avaltroni, president of Fairleigh Dickinson University.
Outcomes-based allocation funding, another source of aid for public four-year universities, would fall by $70 million under Murphy’s proposal, which would also cut $19.6 million in grants for community colleges and reduce aid to private and independent universities by $23.6 million.
Cuts at the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority would eliminate awards through College Opportunity Grants or the Garden State Guarantee for those with income greater than $65,000, though those in that income band who had previously received an award under either program could still receive assistance if they otherwise remained eligible.
The proposal would entirely eliminate a $20 million appropriation for summer tuition aid grants that would fund courses for students in the summer of 2026. Overall, financial aid grants for students would fall by $50.4 million under Murphy’s proposal.
University and community college presidents called to testify before the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee Thursday decried the cuts, cautioning they would make higher education less affordable or lead to programmatic cuts as universities face inflation, rising benefit and utility costs, and widespread uncertainty at the federal level.
“The cut is real to us in pretty significant ways. Having that cut restored eases pressure on tuition,” said Rutgers University President Jonathan Holloway. “Tuition is over a quarter of our revenue stream at Rutgers, and we don’t have much wiggle room in other places, to be quite honest, so having that assistance does go a long way.”
Officials warned community colleges, which are meant to be more accessible than their four-year peers, faced particular risks.
Community colleges account for about half of the state’s undergraduate students and on average charge roughly a third of the tuition at public four-year universities, said Margaret McMenamin, president of Union County College.
That could make them especially vulnerable to changes in enrollment spurred by higher costs.
“We’re not asking you for new investments. We’re just asking you not to go backward,” she said.
Higher Education Secretary Brian Bridges, at times, appeared to support lawmakers’ call for greater investment in higher education, noting that a recommendation to zero out $12 million in funding for a new veterinary school at Rowan University did not originate in his office.
“This is a difficult budget year, as I’ve mentioned before, and at this time, the budget is with you,” he said. “As the secretary of higher education, I endorse supporting the investment in the sector that is needed to allow it to thrive, so I stand ready to provide any support that you might need in advocating for the reinstatement of those reductions.”
The proposed cuts reflect current fiscal circumstances more than a shift in priorities, Bridges added.

	Strong performance in April revenues could help defray some cuts Murphy has proffered in his $58.1 billion budget proposal.
Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) on Thursday said the Treasury had indicated April collections would come in strong, bringing as much as $1 billion more revenue than the agency’s earlier projections.
“The good news that I think we can make this morning is that we’ve heard from treasury that it appears as if our revenues are going to pretty dramatically overperform,” O’Scanlon said. “This should be music to all our ears given these cuts and things that need to absolutely be restored.”
How much of that money might be used to undo higher education cuts remains to be seen. Murphy’s proposed budget includes a $1.2 billion deficit, meaning a $1 billion April surprise would still leave the state spending more than it takes in.
Other lawmakers signaled different priorities could take precedence.
“I warn all not to get giddy over the revenue projections of incoming revenue because one of the charges of this committee that we feel strongly about is to do away with over a billion dollars-worth of new taxes in the budget, so any new revenue is spoken for three times over,” said Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester).
Officials from Treasury and the Office of Legislative Services are due to deliver updated budget projections on May 14.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment.
Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford.


Qualifying BMI criteria in SC
South Carolina’s Medicaid program covers GLP-1 drugs for patients with a BMI of 30 or above. However, patients with a BMI less than 40 must have other health problems to qualify.

Patients with a BMI of 30-34 must have at least one very high-risk factor or at least two other risk factors.
Patients with a BMI of 35 to 39 must have at least one risk factor
Patients with a BMI of 40 or above aren’t required to have other comorbidity conditions (but usually do)

Comorbidities considered very high-risk factors include: Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, sleep apnea
Other risk factors include: Hypertension, cigarette smoking, family history of premature heart disease, osteoarthritis, gallstones, age (men over 45, women over 55 or postmenopausal)
Source: S.C. Department of Health and Human Services


More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them.
But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes.
But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
(Weight loss is not a federally approved use of Ozempic, despite its popularity, though similar drugs of different dosages, such as Wegovy, are approved for obesity treatment.)
The drugs do come with dangers of their own. Common side effects of Wegovy and Ozempic, according to their websites, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and dizziness. Possible serious side effects include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), pancreatitis, kidney failure, and thyroid tumors.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors.
In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
South Carolina’s Medicaid program began covering GLP-1s for obesity Nov. 1. But prior authorization is required, and eligibility depends on patients meeting certain criteria.
To have the drugs paid for by Medicaid, patients must participate in dietary counseling and have a body mass index exceeding the obesity threshold, along with related health problems. And their doctor must attest they are increasing their physical activity, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August.
The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
States consider high costs, possible savings of covering weight-loss drugs for their workers

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.”
The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course.
In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Gov. Tate Reeves submitted a disaster declaration request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency on April 1. If approved, it would allow millions of federal dollars to be allocated to state and local governments. 
The state’s four congressmen and two senators signed a letter on April 2 urging the Trump administration to quickly approve the request. But Lea Crager, a spokesperson for FEMA, told Mississippi Today in a statement that the request is pending.  
The tornadoes impacted around 20 Mississippi counties in mid-March. They caused an estimated $18.2 million in damages, destroyed 233 homes and damaged 208 homes, according to the letter from the federal lawmakers. 
U.S. Rep. Michael Guest, a Republican congressman who represents areas struck by the tornadoes, said in a statement that he has been in contact with Trump’s staff multiple times over the last two weeks and is waiting for the administration to sign off on the request. 
The administration has denied a similar request from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a former Trump White House press secretary, over damage from the same storm system. The administration has also denied requests for disaster relief from other states.
Sanders is appealing that decision, and the state’s congressional delegation, all of whom are Republicans, wrote a letter to the Trump administration asking them to reconsider the denial. 
Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have also floated the idea of dismantling FEMA and suggested that states should spend more of their own money to deal with storm recovery efforts. 
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the state’s lone Democrat in Washington, is the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee. He offered an amendment in the committee recently that would have prevented the federal agency from using federal funds to shutter FEMA. His amendment failed in the GOP-majority committee. 
“For the life of me, I can’t understand why, right now, Arkansas and Mississippi have requested disaster declaration from the president, and he’s refused to give it,” Thompson said in the committee meeting. “North Carolina is struggling. We’re a better country than this.” 
Mississippi has historically benefited from FEMA’s assistance in the wake of deadly storms.
After Hurricane Katrina’s historic devastation in 2005, Mississippi received nearly $25 billion in federal relief spending, which state leaders have credited with saving the state from ruin and allowing communities and families to rebuild.
Below are the full responses from the state delegation to questions from Mississippi Today about the pending disaster declaration request and Trump’s suggestions to shutter FEMA: 
U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker: 
“Mississippi is no stranger to natural disasters. Unfortunately, we are also too familiar with FEMA’s bureaucratic red tape, which stops Mississippians from getting the help they need. I look forward to Mississippi getting much-needed disaster relief and hearing President Trump’s ideas to make FEMA more efficient.”
U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, through her spokesperson, Chris Gallegos: 
“The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes the issuance of major disaster or emergency declarations, which make assistance available to protect property, human health and safety.  These declarations trigger critical aid to people in need, and Senator Hyde-Smith fully supports the Governor’s request on behalf of Mississippians impacted by the tornadoes last month.  The Senator, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, is also open to exploring options for making the delivery of disaster assistance more efficient and cost-effective.”
U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly, 1st Congressional District: 
Did not respond to a request for comment.
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, 2nd Congressional District: 
“Of course, I hope President Trump approves Mississippi’s disaster declaration quickly – but given how he’s been acting lately, I’m not sure we can depend on him to quickly do the right thing. Mississippi, just like every other state, relies on FEMA when disasters strike – whether it’s a storm or a massive hurricane. President Trump wanting to eliminate FEMA is shameful and makes no sense. We’re making sure he won’t be able to do it.”
U.S. Rep. Michael Guest, 3rd Congressional District:
“I have been monitoring the recovery efforts made necessary by storms that hit our state in March. The devastation is awful, and Mississippians are suffering. Right after the storms, I was on the ground for damage assessment, and I have been in continuous contact with those impacted by the storms. Governor Reeves submitted his disaster assistance request to President Trump on April 1st. On April 2nd, the Mississippi Congressional Delegation sent a letter to President Trump requesting his approval of FEMA Federal Assistance. I have been in touch with the President’s staff multiple times in the last two weeks, and we are currently waiting for his final sign-off. Mississippi will rebuild, and we will be stronger when we reach the other side.”

The state Board of Elections changed from a Democratic to a Republican majority on Thursday as state Auditor Dave Boliek exercised his new powers to appoint members to the five-member board.
The change to the board’s partisan makeup has implications for GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin’s ongoing challenge to the results of the state Supreme Court race.
Griffin sued the elections board in his attempt to have votes thrown out as he seeks to unseat Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. With a Democratic majority, the board had resisted that effort and fought in court against tossing votes. That could now change.
Boliek’s appointments come the day after the state Court of Appeals greenlighted a state law that moved elections board appointments and oversight from the governor to the new Republican state auditor. A three-member panel of Superior Court judges had ruled last week that the law was unconstitutional, but Wednesday’s ruling okayed a Republican request to stay that decision.
Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement Wednesday he would appeal to the state Supreme Court.
In a Wednesday X post, Stein said the Appeals Court’s quick decision was an attempt to steal the Supreme Court election.
“I fear that this decision is the latest step in the partisan effort to steal a seat on the Supreme Court,” Stein’s post said.  “No emergency exists that can justify the Court of Appeals’ decision to interject itself at this point. The only plausible explanation is to permit the Republican State Auditor to appoint a new State Board of Elections that will try to overturn the results of the Supreme Court race.”
Federal District Judge Richard Myers has prohibited the Board of Elections from certifying the Supreme Court elections results, essentially declaring a winner, until he gives the okay.
Republican board appointees were nominated by the state Republican Party chair.
“We are pleased to have tremendous individuals serving on the State Board of Elections & thank everyone who expressed interest in these crucial positions,” state GOP Chairman Jason Simmons said on X.  “These board members will ensure North Carolinians have fair, free, honest, and transparent administration of elections.”
Francis X. DeLuca of Wilmington
DeLuca is a former president of the Civitas Institute, a conservative policy organization. Under his leadership, Civitas sued the state Board of Elections over same-day registration in 2016. The federal lawsuit claimed the timing of address verification meant some invalid votes would be counted.
When he ran for Congress in 2019, DeLuca’s campaign website credited him with creating the website “Mapping the Left” and “opposing left-wing “Rev William Barber and the Moral Monday Movement.”
Civitas merged with the John Locke Foundation in 2021.
Former state Sen. Robert Rucho of Catawba County 
Rucho was a long-time member of the Senate. As co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, he was a key cheerleader for state tax cuts. He also led the chamber’s redistricting efforts, defending district lines from claims they were unconstitutional.
Stacy “Four” Eggers IV of Boone
Eggers is a current elections board member. He is the managing partner of the Eggers law firm and a former member of the Watauga County Board of Elections.
The Republican majority in the state legislature tried for years to weaken or eliminate governors’ control over the state Board of Elections, starting before former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, took office in 2017.
Boliek said in a press release he is ready to appoint Democrats when he receives nominations from the state Democratic Party chair.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eggers-DeLuca-Rucho.jpg,,,2025-05-01 15:06:43.053952

Jim Carns, R-Vestavia, passed the House over the objections of Jefferson County Democrats. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives passed a bill Thursday to reorganize the Birmingham Water Works Board (BWWB) over the objections of Jefferson County Democrats who called it state meddling in local affairs. 
SB 330, sponsored by Sen. Dan Roberts, R-Mountain Brook, allows each of the following entities to appoint one member to the board of the utility: the City of Birmingham, Birmingham City Council, Jefferson County Commission, Blount County Commission, Shelby County Commission, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Governor. The governor’s appointment is restricted to a resident of Jefferson County.
The legislation passed the Senate last week unanimously.
“I say it’s a miracle because I’ve been here a lot of years,” he said. “Never, ever have I ever seen a bill where Jefferson County was involved that passed out of the Senate 30-0.”
The legislation is broadly worded but effectively targets the BWWB, which supplies water to Jefferson County and surrounding areas has drawn criticism over rates and governance.  Democrats in the Jefferson County delegation have long resisted efforts to reorganize the board, saying it would give officials outside Jefferson County power over a local resource. Critics have also noted the plans would give majority-white counties control of an asset in a county that is 67% Black. 
Jefferson County Democrats spoke on the bill for over two hours Thursday morning.
“For over a century, the Birmingham Water Works Board has provided safe, clean and reliable water to hundreds of thousands of residents and businesses across our region,” Rep. Patrick Sellers, D-Pleasant Grove, said. “Their work is not only essential, it’s exceptional.”
While Carns said he would not take any amendments on the legislation, four members of the delegation tried. Sellers said the board should not be politicized by elected state officials being eligible for appointment. He offered an amendment that would prohibit any of the appointees from being a lawmaker.
The amendment failed 70-28.
Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, offered an amendment to return appointing authority for one seat on the board to Birmingham City Council instead of the Blount County Commission because there are fewer customers in Blount County than in Jefferson County. 
“We are silencing the voices of Jefferson County when it comes to being able to control their own water, which is a very precious resource,” Tillman said. “We are losing that because we allow an outside source that serves maybe 100 people in certain areas, maybe 8% outside of Jefferson County, to be able to control the water.”
The amendment failed 70-28.
Rep. Jim Hill, R-Odenville, offered an amendment to limit the lieutenant governor’s appointment to a resident of St. Clair County, which is served by the BWWB. He said he’d only ever support the legislation if St. Clair County was represented. 
“We are a customer. We don’t like to be treated that way, as if we are not important,” Hill said. “If you think we’re big enough, if you think we’re important enough, if you think we ought to have representation on a board that we contribute $3 million in revenue to a year then let us have a seat.”
The amendment failed 54-38. Hill abstained on the final vote.
Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, offered an amendment to restrict the board’s appointees from having ownership or interest in any sewer system located in the county the authorizing municipality is located.
“So any potential complications with this bill have not been fully considered, particularly considering the Jefferson County sewer system,” Rafferty said. 
The amendment failed 69-29.
Rafferty began protesting the legislation as the House adopted the Special Order Calendar. He said the bill is an assault on local governance.
“Each of us in this chamber would be rightfully concerned if outside representatives attempted to dictate how water systems operate in our districts without consulting us or even including us at the table, or, hell, even the room where this legislation was created,” he said.
Sellers said during debate that there are other issues with water supply and sewage in the state that are more important than restructuring the BWWB. 
“Lowndes County, a significant portion of this majority black, low-income community, lacks proper sewer infrastructure, leading to raw sewage exposure in homes and public spaces,” he said. “Why now? Why the Birmingham Water Works Board?”
Rep. Kelvin Datcher, D-Birmingham, called the bill undemocratic after it passed 66-27. 
“What happened is undemocratic, and it absolutely destroys the opportunity for us to continue to work together as a region,” he said. 
The bill goes to Gov. Kay Ivey’s desk to be signed into law. A message seeking comment from her office was sent Thursday afternoon.

(Courtesy photo by Michael Remke)New Mexico Highlands University faculty and staff say they are still assessing work safety issues after learning earlier this week that the federal government had abruptly ended an evaluation of health hazards on campus.
Last October, workers at the university in Las Vegas, N.M. asked the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to conduct a health hazard evaluation centered on the Ivan Hilton Science Building, which had closed a month earlier due to improperly stored chemicals. Their unions and school administrators worked together to invite the agency on campus, and investigators interviewed many people, union officials say.
Earlier this week, NIOSH informed the American Federation of Teachers New Mexico that it had ended the evaluation because of cuts by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, President Whitney Holland told Source NM in an interview.
NIOSH’s website states, “Due to the reduction in force across NIOSH, no new health hazard evaluation requests can be accepted.”
Highlands faculty and staff still need medical evaluations, industrial hygiene exposure assessments and behavioral health support, Holland said.
“This truly is a regional issue for Northern New Mexico, and the federal government’s abrupt cancellation of these critical supports jeopardizes our communities’ wellbeing in both the short- and long-term,” she said.
Emails and voicemails seeking comment from NIOSH and Highlands administrators had not been returned as of Thursday morning.
Dr. Kathy Jenkins, a professor of exercise physiology and Faculty and Staff Association president, told Source NM the evaluation’s final report was completed in March and she expected it to reach her soon.
“To find out last week that the case was closed and it doesn’t look like there’s any opportunity to reopen it, was a little devastating,” Jenkins said.
Marty Lujan, a longtime custodian at Highlands who often cleaned the science building, died last fall. His official cause of death is not yet determined, but union officials say he showed signs of chemical exposure.
The science building’s closure, the relocation of classrooms and Lujan’s death caused extreme stress for many people on campus, Michael Remke, an assistant professor in the school’s Department of Forestry, told Source NM.
If the evaluation had been completed, NIOSH would have offered free in-person counseling to faculty, staff and students, he said. The university offered five free sessions on an online therapy platform, he said, but no additional psychiatric or behavioral health support.
“This felt like a nice, productive avenue forward, and now we’re left scrambling to try to figure out how we can get somebody else to step up and provide this for us,” Remke said. “If they’re not providing this, then who can?”
Jenkins said the chemical spill last fall was the event that led outsiders to come into the science building and discover that for at least a decade prior, chemicals had been improperly stored there.
NIOSH would have also been able to conduct a long-term epidemiological study to trace health patterns among people who have worked in the building, Jenkins said. New Mexico doesn’t have the resources to do that on its own, she said.
“There’s concerns of people that have worked in the building for the past decade because of what’s been uncovered,” Jenkins said. “There are concerns on children born with low birth weights. There are concerns of a few people with auto-immune diseases. There have been some people that have died.”
No one will be able to absolutely determine the concerns’ cause, Jenkins said, but people want to know how to help themselves in the future if something were to develop.
“The easy thing is to fix it,” she said. “Then the next step is, what do you do to address the chronic parts of all this? Maybe there are no chronic parts, I have no idea, but maybe there are.”
‘It’s not going to stop us’
Remke started working at Highlands in August 2023. He recalls a strong, fumy smell in his office on the building’s first floor, near the chemical storage room. Before the situation escalated, he said he spent up to 80 hours cleaning up legacy chemical hazards in the science building.

He said he initially experienced burning in his throat and eyes, and then chronic gastrointestinal symptoms that persisted until this February. The university’s insurer denied his worker’s compensation claim, he said, so he had to pay hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket for blood tests to try to resolve his symptoms and determine his illness’ cause.
Remke said during the evaluation, NIOSH officials interviewed him for two hours about his account of what happened in the building and the kinds of services the university needs.
Safety practices on campus have improved generally since the evaluation began, he said, including more support and advocacy for proper materials handling, and the hiring of a dedicated chemical hygiene officer who helps clean up chemical hazards.
Jenkins said Highlands reorganized its Environmental Health and Safety Office, which along with the hygiene officer, puts the university back into compliance.
“We’re working together — the university, the union and the faculty — to make sure this never happens again,” she said.
She said her union holds workplace safety and bloodborne pathogen training on campus, and formed a safety committee to quickly receive reports and resolve situations.
Remke said while future chemical exposures on campus are possible, he thinks the risk is much lower than it was prior to the science building’s closure.
“Some support from these outside agencies was going to be very helpful for us but it’s not going to stop us from trying to organize on our own to make sure that we have an amazing campus with an amazing learning experience for our students,” Remke said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_20250501_113214-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-01 15:06:43.053952

Stanton created the T-shirt displaying her rapist’s face about 15 years ago after the assault. She made several designs, which she used to wear twice a week. 
“For lack of a ladylike word, it’s quite ballsy,” Stanton said. “But that’s how I felt about surviving.” 
Now, Stanton only breaks the shirt out for special occasions, including yesterday’s second annual “Denim Day” hosted by the City of Jackson’s Office of Violence and Trauma Prevention to raise awareness of sexual violence. 
More than 60 advocates, nonprofit employees and community members participated in the event on the brick garden outside City Hall. Organizations from the FBI’s Community Outreach, Teen Health Mississippi, and the Mississippi Coalition Against Sexual Assault shared resources for victims and survivors, such as information on rape kits, STI testing, while the People’s Advocacy Institute offered a sign-up sheet for upcoming meetings for a new program called Jackson Heals focused on trauma recovery through restorative justice conversations.

But perhaps the most impactful part of the event came when Stanton and other survivors spoke about their experience working through the mental toll of sexual assault, multiple attendees said. 
“Nobody wants to talk about sexual assault because it’s ugly, and then we want to say sexual assault when, really, we should say rape,” Stanton said. “The word rape just sounds so heinous. Well, it is. The act is heinous.” 
In 2024, the state saw a 27% increase in rape kits sent to the state crime lab thanks to a 2023 law aimed at reducing the persistent testing backlog and create a systems for survivors to track the kits as they’re processed, though the extent of the backlog is still undocumented. 
Denim Day originated in 1999 after an Italian court found an alleged rape had likely not occurred because, it concluded in a ruling since overturned, the tight jeans the alleged survivor was wearing could not have been removed without her help. Participants in the international event wear denim in solidarity with and in protest of stigma against survivors.
Keisha Coleman, the director of the Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery, said events like this support her goal of bringing together community organizations. 
“One of the most important things is we are bridging community organizations that have been working in silos,” Coleman said. 
The office, which was formed three years ago in the midst of a crime spike in the city, is also working to create a public-facing dashboard that can help Jacksonians understand the extent of crime in Jackson. 
“We are victim advocates, but for the most part, our goal is to focus on the data,” Coleman said. 
Still, Coleman said much of the office’s work has been difficult to quantify. For instance, Coleman, a trauma coach, works with people who have been traumatized by violence. She recently took seven families out to dinner so they could meet each other. 
“We’re just having people call us and say, ‘Hey, I need help,’ or ‘Hey, I’m a mother suffering’ or ‘I’ve received a call to say my daughter was killed, we have to move because of retaliation and I don’t have food,’” she said. “So stuff like that, it’s not tangible.” 
But qualitative impacts matter too, she said. 
“Anytime we can reach one person, we consider it a success,” she said. 
If that’s the goal, Jamesia Wilson Cox’s experience illustrates it was met. 
The counselor and disorder specialist came out on her lunch break to meet people and hear from the speakers, among them an advocate and military veteran from Clinton named Tara Rivers who read a poem about grappling with the reality of being assaulted. 
“Summer months used to be my favorite, but now it’s just another trigger like my 9 millimeter,” Rivers read. 
As she listened, Wilson Cox pulled out her phone and took a selfie. 
That act might seem small to others, but it was meaningful to Wilson Cox. Last year, she was assaulted in her home in Brandon. She said it changed her self-perception and left her feeling “dirty.” She stopped looking in the mirror or taking selfies. 
“I used to be the selfie queen,” she said. 
But day by day, she’s become more comfortable with her image. 
If the city hosts Denim Day next year, Wilson Cox said she hopes to be in a place where she, too, can get up on the stage and speak.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/30143530/Denim-Day-9.jpg,,,2025-05-01 15:06:43.053952

Patrick Morrisey held a news conference on Thursday, May 1, 2025, in Charleston, W.Va., to announce he signed a voter ID bill into law. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)While Wednesday marked the deadline for Gov. Patrick Morrisey to officially sign bills passed this legislative session into law, the governor held a ceremonial bill signing at the state capitol Thursday morning for legislation requiring photo identification for anyone voting in West Virginia.
House Bill 3016, meant to address voter fraud and bolster secure elections, would require a photo ID — typically a driver’s license, passport or a resident identification card — to vote in-person. It eliminated several options previously accepted at polling places to validate identity, including a Medicaid card and utility bill, among others.

Citizens can request a voter registration card with a photograph from either their county clerk or the Secretary of State, per the code, however the process for doing so is not specified in the bill text. Any cards requested will be given free of charge. No funds were allocated through this bill for the creation or distribution of such cards.
Anyone who is unable to provide a valid photo ID at the ballot box will still be able to cast a provisional ballot after signing an affidavit confirming their identity. Once election officials verify their identity, the provisional ballot should be counted as long as the person is an eligible voter.



Photo identifications accepted at polling places on election day:

A valid West Virginia driver’s license or valid West Virginia identification card issued by the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles.
A valid driver’s license issued by a state other than the state of West Virginia.
A valid United States passport or passport card.
A valid employee identification card with a photograph of the eligible voter issued by the United States government or of the state of West Virginia, or by any county, municipality, board, authority, or other political subdivision of West Virginia.
A valid student identification card with a photograph of the eligible voter issued by an institution of higher education in West Virginia by a West Virginia high school.
A valid military identification card issued by the United States with a photograph of the person desiring to vote.
A valid voter registration card that includes the voter’s photograph issued by a county clerk in the state of West Virginia or the Secretary of State. 




In comments Thursday, Morrisey and other legislative leaders acknowledged that voter fraud is not widespread in West Virginia, but alleged that making HB 3016 into law will ensure that remains true.
Nationwide, however, studies have found that photo ID requirements for voting can restrict ballot box access for millions of people — namely older people, low-income residents and already marginalized groups. There is little evidence showing that such laws limit voter fraud, which is incredibly rare.
West Virginia already has abysmal voter turnout. Opponents of HB 3016 voiced concerns during session that the bill will make it difficult — particularly for older West Virginians and those who don’t drive or lack access to the internet — to vote in the state. 
The legislation was one of several priorities listed by Secretary of State Kris Warner before the beginning of the 2025 session. On Thursday, Morrisey called the measure “commonsense.”
“Democratic elections are only as strong as the trust placed in them by the voters,” Morrisey said “This commonsense legislation secures West Virginia’s elections and instills faith in the voting process.”
Morrisey signed DEI ban, bill requiring teachers to out students’ gender identity to parents 
As Wednesday’s deadline for gubernatorial action came to a close, Gov. Morrisey signed several bills into law — including one to ban nearly all diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state.
Senate Bill 474 was a priority for Morrisey. The bill bans the offering of specific services or opportunities to people based on their race, color, ethnicity, country of origin and, in some instances, sex. It applies to DEI policies and initiatives in state and local governments and schools, including institutions of higher education.
On the final night of session, the bill almost didn’t pass. Lawmakers in the House introduced and considered dozens of amendments that evening — mostly from Democrats — to slow the bill’s progress. After nearly three hours of debate, the bill passed the House 87-12 with one member absent. 
When SB 474 was returned to the Senate for consideration with less than two hours remaining before sine die, Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, had a similar plan.
Garcia filed 13 amendments that were to be considered on the bill before lawmakers voted on it. However, what he called “dirty tricks” prevailed as Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, called for a rare suspension of Joint Rule 3, which stopped Garcia’s amendments from being taken up. Garcia and Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, had their microphones silenced on the floor and the rest of the chamber — all Republicans — passed the bill without any discussion.
Garcia questioned the legitimacy of the bill’s passage. Now, with the bill signed into law, someone would need to challenge its standing in court to prove him right or wrong.
Despite the bill being a priority for Morrisey and introduced at his request, he signed the bill into law quietly on Wednesday night.
That evening, he also signed Senate Bill 154, a bill that requires teachers to tell parents when a child requests to be referred to by a different name or pronouns that are different from the student’s biological sex. The bill also permits parents who aren’t alerted about their child’s gender-related requests to bring legal action against the public school.
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Amy Grady, R-Mason, a public school teacher who sponsored an identical measure last year. Other Republicans who defended the measure said that parents’ rights should always come before a child’s privacy or educators’ concerns. 
Fairness WV opposes the education measure. Andrew Scheider, executive director of the LGBTQ civil rights organization, told West Virginia Watch it would force teachers to out their students even if they have reason to believe doing so would result in students being abused at home.
“In cases like these, a teacher would be faced with choosing between following this new law or putting their student’s life at risk,” he said. 
Bills vetoed by Morrisey this session
Out of the total 249 bills passed this legislative session, Morrisey vetoed just six. In social media posts just before midnight on Wednesday, Morrisey said those vetoes were “due to unfunded mandates, questionable policy, or fiscal concerns.
Vetoed bills include:

SB 369, which would have promulgated legislative rules for multiple agencies and boards. In his comments regarding the veto, Morrisey voiced concerns with some inconsistencies in the legislation as well as technical issues. Substance wise, Morrisey said he disagreed with parts of the bill that would have changed regulatory processes for political action committees in the state. While his concerns laid with only parts of the legislation, he urged lawmakers to “expeditiously work to modify and fix the technical flaws” he listed.
SB 158, which would have limited members of the state Board of Education from serving in other political roles while holding a seat on the board. The bill would have banned sitting school board members from becoming a candidate for any other public office, serving as a delegate to a national political party convention or soliciting or receiving campaign contributions for any candidate for partisan office. Morrisey said he disagreed with such limits, as running for office is a “fundamental right” and efforts to limit that were “constitutionally concerning.” 
SB 531, which would have levied specific misdemeanor charges and fines against anyone who assaulted an athletic official or athlete in the state. Morrisey said that while he finds such offenses “abhorrent,” he “cannot justify a crime against a referee carrying a minimum sentence that is double that for assault on a police officer.” He urged lawmakers to work with his office to “craft better legislation.”
SB 722, which would have created the West Virginia Short Line Railroad Modernization Act by levying tax credits for short line rail companies in the state. Morrisey said the state “cannot afford” the bill and voiced concerns regarding its approach to tax reform generally.
HB 2120, which would have made changes to the makeup of the state’s Ethics Commission and added new requirements to comply with its standards. Morrisey said his veto came at the request of the Ethics Commission. Members there, he said, voiced concerns that the changes would place “considerable strain” on the Commission’s already “tight” budget and make it more difficult to find individuals willing to serve on it.
HB 2351, which would have increased the hourly compensation rate for panel attorneys in the state. The rates proposed would have increased pay from from $60 to $70 for out-of-court work, and from $80 to $90 for in-court work. Morrisey said he was “sympathetic” about the intent of the bill, however making it law would have created a “shortfall in appropriations without any identified offsets.” Since the Legislature decreased funding for public defenders in the budget passed this session, Morrisey said, a veto was necessary since “the math does not add up.”

As a product of, and sometimes in spite of, a textbook mid-western life, Sally and her siblings, Chip, David and Laurie lived a life full of propriety and irreverence, humor and depth, love and loss — punctuated by endless days of teasing each other at every misstep and foible. They shared many adventures and remained extremely close until the very end.Sally’s parents encouraged her to pursue one of the three professions “appropriate” for a young mid-western woman of the early 1960s: teacher, nurse or secretary. Fresh out of the University of Minnesota with a degree in education, Sally hopped on a bus to teach school in Mexico, followed by teaching positions in Bangkok, Texas and Boston. While her parents embraced her early role as an educator, they were immensely proud when she later added marketing executive, firefighter, alderwoman, Executive Director of the Vermont Republican party, Mayor of Montpelier, political leader, activist, adventurer, rabblerouser, bon vivant and woman-about-town to her list of many of earned titles, both official and self-proclaimed.While undeterred by solo travel, her best travel adventures were always in the company of family and close friends, but none more so than with her loving partner and companion of the last ten years, Darwin Niles. Together they embarked on 44 incredible journeys across Japan, Mongolia, Svalbard, Easter Island, Ushuaia, Armenia, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Australia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Komodo Island and countless other destinations. Sally treated every adventure as if the world was trying to challenge the bounds of her curiosity, knowledge, energy and, most importantly, her independence.Sally raised her three sons, Jed, Stephen and David in Montpelier, Vermont. As a mother of three energetic, young boys, she was a counselor, drill instructor, cheerleader, disciplinarian, public defender, prosecutor, champion, coach and companion. She put her very best into molding her children into the men, fathers, husbands, partners and professionals they are today. Later, as a doting grandmother, “Grammie” was a constant and positive presence in the lives of her seven granddaughters and two grandsons.Sally eventually moved to Burlington where she became firmly entrenched in the community, helping refugees and displaced persons from Bhutan, Somalia and Afghanistan become welcome members of the community. When she wasn’t helping others, her calendar was filled with hikes, bike trips, Zumba classes, Friends in Council, ski club, book club and countless other activities which she enjoyed with the many dear friends she made along the way.She is survived by Jed and his partner Ali, Jed’s children Matthew, Catherine, Meghan and Claire, his stepsons Alex and Will and his first wife, Callie; Stephen and his wife Jody and their children Charlie, Summer and Lucca; and David and his wife Fatima and their daughters Ihsan Sara and Taia. She is also survived by her brother David and his wife Barbara, her sister Laurie and her husband Chris and her many nieces, nephews, grand-nieces and grand-nephews. She will be dearly missed by Darwin Niles, her loving companion. She will be happily reunited with her parents Orville and Mary Elaine, her brother Chip and her cherished friend, Otto Meier.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sara Rice.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sara-Rice.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 14:11:13.570334

(Delaney Nolan/Louisiana Illuminator)A packed legislative committee meeting erupted with cheers and sobs of joy Tuesday, as a bill advanced a long-awaited remedy for people imprisoned in Louisiana under unconstitutional split-jury verdicts.
Senate Bill 218, by Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, would allow people convicted by non-unanimous juries to petition for their cases to be reviewed. The Senate Committee on Judiciary B approved the proposal in a 5-1 vote. 
Up until 2018, Louisiana and Oregon were the only two states where defendants could be convicted if at least 10 of 12 jurors voted guilty. The standard goes back to a Jim Crow era law intended to nullify the voice of Black jurors. As of 2020, about 80% of people incarcerated in Louisiana on split-jury verdicts were Black based on a Project of Justice Initiative analysis. 
Louisiana voters approved an amendment in 2018 to do away with split verdicts, though it did not impact persons already tried and sentenced by a non-unanimous jury vote. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Ramos v. Louisiana that split-jury convictions are unconstitutional, but justices left it up to states to determine if the ruling would apply retroactively to older cases.
Two years later, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled the change applied only to verdicts after 2018, meaning those convicted by split juries before 2018 had no recourse.

Duplessis’ bill would change that, but it still faces long odds in the Republican-dominated legislature. The bill, which found bipartisan support in committee, would need nine Republicans to support it on the Senate floor in addition to all Democrats. Gov. Jeff Landry, when he was attorney general, argued against the abandonment of split-jury verdicts when Ramos was before the U.S. Supreme Court.      
Some of Landry’s arguments were echoed by the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, which opposes the bill. Its members argue, in part, that it would be too complex and costly to retry people convicted by split juries.
There are currently 773 people incarcerated in Louisiana on non-unanimous jury convictions, according to the Promise of Justice Initiative.
Duplessis’ bill would allow them to petition for a retrial. If a judge deems the defendant eligible, their conviction would be voided, and a district attorney would then decide whether to re-prosecute their case, offer a plea deal, or dismiss the charges.
Duplessis and other supporters pointed out any retrials would still favor the prosecutor because they could reuse witness testimony from the original trial, while the defense couldn’t necessarily cross-examine those witnesses if they have since died or are otherwise unavailable.
Will Snowden, a Loyola University law professor, said 13 people convicted by non-unanimous verdicts in Louisiana have been exonerated, citing figures from the Innocence Project New Orleans.
Striking testimony for the bill came from Herman Evans, who was convicted in 1980 on a 10-2 jury and spent decades in Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola for a murder he didn’t commit. The Promise of Justice Initiative had his conviction overturned in 2024.
Evans spoke of losing his father, daughter and three sisters while wrongly imprisoned. 
“Every time I tried to make my voice heard over 37 years, I kept getting one word: denied,” Evans said. Upon release, he said, “I left a lot of people behind that deserve to have their unconstitutional convictions overturned.”
Jermaine Hudson, who was wrongfully convicted in 1999 in New Orleans by a split jury, spoke to the committee alongside Bobby Gumpright, whose false testimony as an 18-year-old led to Hudson’s conviction. Hudson spent 22 years in prison for an armed robbery that never happened.
On Tuesday, Gumpright wept as he spoke of Hudson’s forgiveness.
“I couldn’t change the past, but I could refuse to live the lie any longer while injustice continued,” Gumpright said. “Louisiana can’t change the past. But Louisiana can refuse to let its injustice live on.”
‘Racism created this problem’
Zach Daniels, executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, disagreed with the assessment that all non-unanimous jury convictions are unjust. 
Some jurors who don’t vote for convictions do so because they actually want stronger charges, such as first-degree murder instead of second-degree murder, Daniels said. He did not offer data on the frequency of such cases, but he disputed the Promise of Justice Initiative’s count of people who could be entitled to new trials. The number is much larger than 773, he said.
Sen. Joseph Bouie, D-New Orleans, rejected Daniels’ arguments. 
“What about those individuals who were convicted and were innocent? The scope of work should not be an issue. The cost should not be an issue,” Bouie said. “If we do not afford the opportunity, we close the doors of justice that are the result of a system of racism that created this problem.”
Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, agreed with Bouie. “If there’s just one innocent person serving time for a crime that they didn’t do, I don’t know how you justify the rationale that [because] this is difficult to do, we shouldn’t do it,” McMath told Daniels.
Duplessis also argued it is a disservice to victims to not ensure the right person has been convicted — and that wrongfully convicted people are themselves victims.
The dialogue between Duplessis and Daniels grew heated toward the end of the two-hour hearing, as Duplessis challenged him on several points. He criticized Daniels for not having reached out to district attorneys in Oregon, where more than 700 people were retried after split-jury verdicts and it did not snarl the courts. 
“I think it’s a slap in the face to this committee because what it shows us is that you’re not trying to solve the problem,” Duplessis told Daniels. “I’m trying to find a solution. The question is: Are you?”
After Sen. Robert Owen, R-Slidell, cast the clinching “yes” vote to advance the bill to the Senate floor, cheers, applause and cries of “thank you” broke out from the committee room crowd. Owen joined McMath, Bouie, Duplessis and Sen. Jimmie Harris, D-New Orleans, in supporting the proposal.   
Sen. Kirk Talbot, R-River Ridge, cast the only vote in opposition. He briefly noted during debate that no district attorneys showed up to support Duplessis’ bill at Tuesday’s committee hearing. 
“There’s no daylight between public opinion and doing the right thing on non-unanimous juries,” Mary-Patricia Wray, who’s lobbied for the Promise of Justice Initiative since 2016, told Illuminator. “This issue isn’t controversial outside the Capitol. Voters already decided what justice looks like. Now it’s the legislature’s turn to catch up.”
In the hallway after the hearing, people who had come to support the bill wept openly and hugged each other.
“I feel great,” Evans told the Illuminator, smiling broadly before turning away for another embrace.

Still, the six-week ban led to a sharp decline in the number of abortions. By the state’s count, there were 19,198 fewer abortions in 2024 than in 2023. Another estimate from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health policy and research organization tracking medication abortions from pills shipped through the mail, places the decrease in abortions at 12,100. 
As of March 31, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration reported 8,682 abortions. 
In interviews with the Florida Phoenix, representatives of Planned Parenthood this week stressed that its clinics are still providing people with access to health care services that run the gamut.
“We’re still here. We’re still going to be here. Planned Parenthood has always been around. I cannot imagine it not being around,” said Dr. Cherise Felix, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of South, East, and North Florida. 
“We’ve expanded our service line. I think it’s important for the community to know we do much more than abortion care. We do vasectomies, we do prenatal care, we do fertility care. We do menopausal care. It’s not just abortions and STDs (sexually transmitted diseases). But I think the community is learning that. There’s a large need for Planned Parenthood.”
Contraception and reproductive health changes
The Florida Supreme Court last year upheld a 15-week abortion ban, which cleared the way for a more restrictive six-week ban Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law in 2023 to take effect May 1, 2024, presuming the outcome of the court ruling.
The law bans abortions after six weeks’ gestation, before many people know they’re pregnant. There are exceptions for people who get pregnant as a result of rape, incest, or human trafficking. They can obtain abortions up to 15 weeks, but they must show a restraining order, police report, medical record, or court document showing that a crime is the reason they want to terminate the pregnancy. 
Other exceptions to the state’s six-week ban require two doctors to certify that the termination of the pregnancy is necessary to “save the pregnant woman’s life or avert a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.” 
A single physician can approve the procedure if no other doctor is available. Abortions in the third trimester are legal if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. A proposed constitutional amendment to allow abortions up to the point of viability was approved by a majority of voters but didn’t receive the necessary 60% approval to pass.
In the year since the restrictive six-week ban took effect, Felix said, more of her patients are requesting longer-acting reversible contraception (LARC) implants.
And some patients are asking for more permanent birth control, she said.
“Something I didn’t expect is to see an increase in vasectomy patients — men that are seeking vasectomies because it’s not safe anymore to not have really good contraception on board. And sometimes things fail, birth control pills fail, birth control sometimes fail,” she said. “So we see a lot of men who are there who aren’t really willing to leave it up to chance anymore and so they are starting to be a lot more involved in contraception as well.” 
  Dr. Robyn Schickler, chief medical officer, Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida (photo via Planned Parenthood.)
Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida Chief Medical Officer Dr. Robyn Schickler says that since the six-week ban she’s seen an uptick in patients with miscarriages diagnosed by other physicians who refer them to a Planned Parenthood center because “they don’t know if they can take care of them” under Florida law.
The clinic is seeing patients seeking exceptions to the six-week ban either because they were raped or are having maternal health complications or their fetus has a fetal abnormality, Schickler said.
Florida law defines a fatal fetal abnormality as a terminal condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, regardless of the provision of life-saving medical treatment, is incompatible with life outside the womb and will result in death upon birth or imminently thereafter. Two physicians must certify in writing that there is a fatal fetal abnormality in order to qualify for an exception to the six-week ban.
The definition is narrow and leaves pregnant people in a tough situation. Schickler said that it locks out some women with fetuses with genetic or chromosomal abnormalities.
“When it doesn’t qualify, it’s something really bad but, medically speaking, you can’t give a definitive, ‘Yes, of course the fetus will die, you know, in the uterus or right after birth.’ There’s some things you can’t, you can’t say for sure. And so it doesn’t fit that narrow exception,” Schickler said.


 
 

Navigating abortion travel
Some of Schickler’s patients aren’t even aware of the six-week abortion ban and are shocked when they first present and are told they cannot obtain an abortion.
“I would say the most common is they just start crying like they can’t believe it. Devastation,” Schickler said, describing their reactions. “Sometimes we’ll get someone, you know, asking if you can make an exception and just do this one, which of course we can’t legally. Most of the time, though, it’s just it’s really sad like, you know, immediate crying, complete devastation.”
Planned Parenthood affiliates across Florida refer patients to their patient navigation program, which indentifies clinics in states where they can still obtain an abortion. Statewide, more than 3,000 Florida patients have used the system in the last year, according to Planned Parenthood.
Additional groups in Florida provide money for abortions in and out of the state, which entails paying for flights, hotels, and rideshares. This year alone, the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund has helped around 1,100 people end pregnancies, said Bree Wallace, the organization’s director for case management. Most of the people the fund helps end up obtaining appointments in D.C. and Illinois. 
“Now, people can go within a few days sometimes, so it’s definitely more expensive,” Wallace said. “Flights alone have been, like, $600 to $800, usually, and if someone wants to bring someone with them, that doubles.”
TBAF’s logistical support to help people get to their appointments added up to $91,000 last year, according to its impact report.
“It’s definitely been more expensive. I mean, every case is different, but you could definitely spend almost $2,000 alone on travel for someone going out of state,” Wallace said.

Legal challenges for minors

 
Aside from the six-week ban, there are other restrictions in Florida’s abortion laws. Only doctors are authorized to provide abortions and telehealth is banned, which means physicians must be in the room when women are administered abortion medication.
Florida has a 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that patients undergo a sonogram exam before obtaining an abortion. Minors must notify their parents and secure their approval but a judge can waive those requirements.
The Tampa fund helps minors connect with The Jane Network, which provides free legal services to get a judicial bypass.
While the rate of approval for a judicial bypasses remained steady since the six-week ban went into effect, the number of petitions declined by 43% from 2022 to 2024, according to annual reports from the Office of the State Courts Administrator.
Out of 130 petitions minors filed for a court’s approval to seek an abortion last year, judges approved 123. Amanda Greenfield, founder and executive director of The Jane Network, said minors seek judicial bypass because their parents are abusive or they may be estranged and not living at home.
“Often a young person will reach out to us and, by the very next day, they will have an attorney and be able to go to court, and, hopefully, get that judicial bypass granted,” Greenfield said.
Since the six-week ban, minors have been contacting the pro bono group before they know they’re pregnant, Greenfield said.
“We are seeing a lot of fear with young people. Young people contact us all the time, even before they know they’re pregnant, because they think there’s a chance that they’re pregnant,” she said. “If so, they wanna make sure they will be able to meet all the requirements before six weeks.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Senate shut down a pair of bills Thursday that would restrict the state’s ability to mandate vaccines for children, but passed legislation that would take away local health officials’ authority to enact public health measures.
House Bill 230 is a Republican-backed bill that, if enacted, will revoke the authority of town and city health officers to enact public health measures, a power they currently have under state law. If HB 230 becomes law, it would be up to city councils, select boards, and other governing bodies to pass such health measures.
The Senate approved the bill in a voice vote Thursday, and it is now headed to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk. The House approved the bill in early March.
Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, a Portsmouth Democrat, was the only person to speak on the Senate floor about the bill. She argued it would hurt towns’ and cities’ ability to react quickly to local incidents. As examples, she listed the need to spray for mosquitos or address a rodent infestation, “things that a health officer just needs to do as a normal course of business.” She noted that in “the vast majority of these situations” recommendations made by a health officer already need to be approved by a local board of health in a public meeting.
During a hearing for the bill last month, the Senate Election Law and Municipal Affairs Committee — which ultimately voted, 3-2, to recommend this bill for approval — heard from Wayne Whitford, with the New Hampshire Health Officers Association, who said that health officers in the state oppose this bill. He argued that the current procedures have been in place for 40 years and are well understood. Margaret Byrnes of the New Hampshire Municipal Association also opposed the bill at the hearing.
The bill is a response to public health measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as masking requirements and social distancing meant to mitigate the spread of the virus. However, the bill’s sponsors say it goes beyond the pandemic and is aimed at preventing future public health measures.
One constituent, Julie Smith of Nashua, at the March hearing said she supported the bill in hopes that it would end “mask madness,” referring to masking requirements municipalities put in place during the pandemic. She hopes this bill can “quash out future opportunities” for such requirements. Those measures became controversial, mostly among conservatives who argued they were government overreach.
The Legislature tried to enact very similar legislation, Senate Bill 63, last session, but then-Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed the bill. Sununu said the bill’s wording was confusing and argued it would create uncertainty during emergencies like a pandemic. Ayotte replaced Sununu in the corner office in January.
House Bill 679 would have forbidden the state from requiring that children receive vaccines that haven’t been shown in clinical trials to prevent transmission of a disease. The Senate rejected this bill as part of the consent agenda.
The bill originated in the House, where it was approved by a 204-165 vote. There, it was supported almost entirely by Republicans. Only one House Democrat, Rep. Jonah Wheeler of Peterborough, voted in favor of it.
Bill opponents — including members of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee and House Democrats — argued that the purpose of vaccines isn’t necessarily to directly prevent transmission of the illness but rather to reduce the severity of the illness and help reduce transmission through herd immunity. They also feared it would limit the availability of vaccines in the state.
House Republicans backing this bill included Manchester Republican Rep. Matt Drew, who said on the House floor last month that the bill “is not about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines,” but rather it “is about whether the state should mandate — force — children to get certain vaccines.” The Senate rejected that argument.
House Bill 357 received more consideration from the Senate, but was ultimately rejected as well. The bill would have taken away the authority of the state’s Health and Human Services commissioner to choose which vaccines New Hampshire children must receive. Under HB 357, the state Legislature would decide which vaccines are required for children.
The immediate result of this bill being enacted would have been varicella, Hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccines no longer being mandatory for children starting July 2026. Diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, poliomyelitis, rubella, rubeola, and tetanus vaccines would’ve remained mandatory as they’re required by state statute, not a rule created by the commissioner. For vaccines to be added to that list under this bill, the Legislature would have had to approve legislation to that effect.
The Senate Health and Human Services Committee previously voted unanimously, 5-0, to recommend the entire Senate reject this bill, and on Thursday the Senate heeded that advice and killed it through a voice vote. The Senate’s vote goes against the wishes of Republicans in the House, which voted 195-174 to pass it. Wheeler was again the only Democrat to vote in favor.
Prior to Thursday’s vote, Sen. Keith Murphy, a Manchester Republican in favor of the bill, argued it was not “about the efficiency of vaccines.”
“It’s a bill about who gets to make the decision,” Murphy continued. “You may hear the commissioner has not abused the authority and has rarely used it. And that may well be true, but departments change and commissioners and cultures over time. And the wrong person could well begin enforcing those vaccinations in the future.”
Sen. Kevin Avard, a Nashua Republican, said that despite being “one of the most vocal critics of vaccine mandates in the Senate,” he doesn’t support this bill because the process the Health and Human Services commissioner follows is already working well and gives the Legislature an oversight authority to monitor any decisions made by the commissioner. He noted that the commissioner has not exercised the power to mandate a new vaccine in the past 20 years. And he’s confident that if they were to do so, the Legislature’s oversight committees would examine that closely.
“HB 357 would in fact short-circuit the rules process that has been working really well and which maintains legislative authority,” Avard said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/townhall-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-01 14:11:13.570334

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd). For the third year in a row, Kentucky saw a decrease in fatal drug overdoses, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Thursday. 
Still, 1,410 Kentuckians died from an overdose last year, according to the 2024 Drug Overdose Fatality Report, which was released Thursday.  
“That’s 1,410 too many people that we lost,” Beshear said. “These are people’s friends and family members, each one a child of God taken from us far too soon.”  
In 2023, Kentucky had 1,984 overdose deaths, which was a decrease from the 2,135 lost in 2022. 
Black Kentuckians also saw a decrease in 2024, a reversal from previous years. In 2024, 170 Black Kentuckians died from a drug overdose, a decrease from 259 in 2022 and 264 in 2023. 
The report does not break down deaths across all races. It shows 1,216 of the 2024 deaths were white Kentuckians, 170 were Black and 24 were of an “other” race. 
This decrease means “that this good news has come for all of our Kentucky communities,” Beshear said. 
Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, is still a key culprit in killing Kentuckians. Fentanyl was present in 62% of the 2024 deaths and methamphetamine was present in 51%, according to the report. 
“Those two continue to be the most prevalent and ultimately most deadly drugs found in overdoses,” Beshear said. 
The counties with the highest rates of fatal drug overdoses were Lee, Knott, Breathitt, Powell and Estill, according to the report — all Eastern Kentucky counties. 
The age range most affected were Kentuckians 35-44, with 379 deaths in that age range. Five children aged 4 or under died from drug overdose in 2024; fewer than 5 died between the ages of 5-14. 
Van Ingram, the executive director for the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy, said “we still lost 1,400 Kentuckians, and so our work’s not finished, not by a long shot, it’s just time to get back to work.” 
Beshear cited prevention efforts such as Narcan distribution, syringe exchange programs and treatment recovery programs in driving the numbers down. 
The report says that for 2024: 

$29,754,033 was distributed in grant and pass-through funding from the Office of Drug Control Policy. 
170,000 doses of Narcan were distributed.
84 syringe exchange program sites served 27,799 unique participants.
142,312 Kentuckians received addiction services through Medicaid. 
17,399 Kentuckians received treatment paid by Kentucky Opioid Response Effort. 
17,984 Kentuckians received recovery services like house assistance, employment services, transportation and basic need services in their community paid by Kentucky Opioid Response Effort. 
3,329 incoming calls were made to the KY HELP Call Center with 14,087 outgoing follow up calls. 
21 counties now certified as Recovery Ready Communities representing 1,495,518 Kentuckians. 

Kentuckians living with addiction can call Kentucky’s help line at 833-859-4357. Narcan, which can help reverse overdoses, is available at pharmacies for sale and through some health departments and outreach programs for free. 
The legislature decriminalized fentanyl test strips in 2023, meaning Kentuckians can use them to legally check substances for the presence of fentanyl. 
“Today’s news should be very meaningful to all Kentuckians, and it ought to tell us that an epidemic that arose in our time, we should be able to defeat in our time,” Beshear said.  “This is not something we should leave for our kids and our grandkids. This is something we should continue to strive to do better, better, better at addressing.”

(Photo by Isabel Koyama / Howard Center for Investigative Journalism)New Mexico oil and gas operators averaged a spill every seven hours in the beginning months of 2025, according to a recent report released by a local environmental group.
Santa Fe-based nonprofit WildEarth Guardians compiled the spill data reported between January and March 2025 by oil and gas operators to the state’s Oil Conservation Division, and found 75,000 barrels of liquids had spilled across six counties in the San Juan, Bravo Dome and Permian basins.
The report concludes these spills, mostly from active wells, “threaten drinking water aquifers, soil health, air quality and the well-being of frontline communities and ecosystems.”
“We want to make sure that the public and policymakers are aware that this is an environmental crisis hiding in plain sight,” Rebecca Sobel, a campaign manager at WildEarth Guardians, told Source. “These spills are happening as the regular cost of doing business, they’re not exceptions — they’re the rule for oil and gas operations in New Mexico.”
Of the 75,858 barrels of liquid spilled, operators lost about 10% of the waste into the environment.
“That loss means it’s spilled and not recoverable from the environment,” Sobel said. “That’s permanent contamination.”
A spokesperson for the New Mexico Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department, which oversees the state’s Oil Conservation Division, said in a written statement that the department would not comment on specifics in the report.
“We cannot speak to the specifics of the Wild Earth Guardians report,” EMNRD spokesperson Sidney Hill wrote. “However, the Oil Conservation continues to enforce its rules requiring operators to report and properly remediate all releases on land under its jurisdiction. The OCD also issues violation notices and fines when operators fail to properly remediate a release.”
The report urged state and federal regulators to “issue meaningful fines, deny permits for repeat violators,” and publicly report the outcomes for violations around spills.
Nearly two thirds of the spills were of produced water — the wastewater from oil and gas fracking — which can contain radioactive materials, cancer-causing or toxic chemicals, heavy metals. Produced water also contains unknown chemicals used in the fracking process which do not have to be disclosed to the public or regulators under trade secrets protections.
“It’s hard to do any kind of remediation or cleanup when you don’t know what you’re cleaning up,” Sobel said.
Additionally, 90 of the spills included crude oil — which contains cancer-causing components such as benzene and metals such as nick, arsenic and mercury. Finally, 28 spills contained condensate, the entrapped liquid hydrocarbon mixtures, and a byproduct of oil and natural gas production, which contains benzene, as well as emissions that can cause health effects.
About half of the spills’ causes — 152 — were listed as “equipment failure,” followed by 66 incidents of “corrosion” and 29 “human error” spills.
Nearly 90% of the spills happened in the state’s southeast corner, split nearly evenly between Eddy and Lea Counties in the Permian basin. Next highest were San Juan and Rio Arriba counties in the San Juan. Finally, one spill each occurred in Harding and Union counties in the Bravo Dome basin.
The majority of spills were listed on federal public lands at 199 spills, followed by 66 incidents on private land and 65 releases on state trust land.
This is the first of quarterly reports WildEarth Guardians expects to release this year.
“Our hope is that by tracking these spills, making them publicly available and accessible, folks start to take them seriously and regulators enact meaningful enforcement and regulation,” Sobel said.

The federally mandated nonprofit has not received the remainder of its federal funding for the current fiscal year. The organization, referred to as a protection and advocacy agency, is awaiting over $700,000 for several critical programs.  
“ … Without our promised funding, if someone calls tomorrow and needs assistance, we can only refer them to another agency, which is so troubling and antithetical to the mission-driven work that we do,” Polly Tribble, DRMS’ executive director, said in a press release.
The funding delays will affect the organization’s ability to investigate reports of neglect and abuse and to advocate for voter accessibility for those with disabilities, among other services. The five affected programs are funded through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration and Administration on Community Living – both housed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
Disability Rights Mississippi recently released a report uncovering widespread misconduct in the industry of unlicensed personal care homes across Mississippi, where, unlike in other states, these facilities “have the ability to comfortably engage in illegal practices without the threat of licensing agencies penalizing them.” 
The organization is waiting on just over $741,000 out of $1.3 million awarded for those programs, DRMS Communications Director Jane Carroll told Mississippi Today. 
The magnitude of the money being withheld is what’s leading the nonprofit’s leaders to call this year’s delays a “funding crisis.”
“Maybe one program could be delayed, that’s not totally unheard of … But what’s different here is that it’s all five programs from Health and Human Services, which are our larger programs,” Carroll explained. 
Mississippi’s health and mental health departments have fallen victim to massive cuts in funding in recent months from HHS under the Trump administration.
Protection and advocacy agencies supporting the rights of disabled people in New Jersey and Arkansas have had to limit their services in recent weeks due to not receiving the federal funding they are owed, Mother Jones reported.
A draft of President Donald Trump’s proposed 2026 budget shows eliminations or significant funding reductions of many of DRMS’ programs, Tribble said in the press release.
For the time being, the organization will focus on continuing to serve current DRMS clients as funding allows, but has instated a hiring freeze until further notice. 
“It seems all of these changes, eliminations, and delays are in the name of efficiency and to save money, but our work enables Mississippians to get back to work, to be self-reliant, and to avoid institutionalization in the expensive facilities that rely on taxpayer dollars,” Tribble said. “So not only does our agency’s operations make financial sense, but also, the work we do literally saves lives. We are at a loss at the thought of no longer being able to serve the community we so deeply value.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/05030917/3X0A6028-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-01 14:11:13.570334

The teams’ future at Truman Sports Complex, though, is increasingly in doubt as the franchises ponder options on both sides of the state line and as officials in the Jackson County Legislature and Missouri General Assembly struggle to coordinate a “Missouri solution” to keep the teams in the state.
Stadium uncertainty surged after the Royals announced they were exploring stadium options elsewhere, including downtown and North Kansas City. The Chiefs, meanwhile, said they were exploring ways to upgrade Arrowhead Stadium as well as other options, including moving to Kansas.
Both teams said they would stay in Jackson County if voters renewed a 3/8-percent sales tax to help them upgrade or build their stadiums. But an overwhelming majority of Jackson County voters rejected that idea in April 2024.
The debate comes at a time when stadium costs are soaring. Washington, D.C., just announced a deal to build a new football stadium for the Washington Commanders, which comes with a $3.7 billion price tag. The District of Columbia will contribute $1.1 billion in public financing to help cover costs of the stadium and surrounding housing and commercial projects, including $500 million from a city tax on large corporations.
This year, Kansas City-area lawmakers in the Missouri General Assembly have coalesced around two main efforts to keep the teams in the state. But a push to make state funding available to the teams appears doomed as the legislature enters the final weeks of session.
 Keeping the Chiefs and Royals in Jackson County

In February, three Kansas City-area lawmakers proposed identical bills to create a state assistance program for stadiums and other event venues.
Under the bills filed by Rep. Mark Sharp, a Kansas City Democrat, Rep. Sherri Gallick, a Belton Republican, and Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat, the state would incentivize investment in new and existing facilities through grants, withholding-tax retention and tax-increment financing.
To participate in the program, the project must be at least one-third privately funded, be able to seat at least 20,000 people and have a minimum $250 million price tag.
Those bills were filed days after House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, said he believed “time is running out” on keeping the teams in Missouri but said “this is going to be something that has to happen in the county first and then the state.”
None of those bills has been referred to a committee, even as the legislative session enters its final weeks.
When asked why there had been little movement on the bills, House Majority Floor Leader Alex Riley, a Republican from Springfield, said that “as of now, that’s not something I’ve spent a lot of time looking at. I haven’t heard a lot about those bills.”
Sharp said House and Senate leadership have declined to move forward with his, Gallick’s and Washington’s bills until Jackson County passes a new sales tax.
“The state legislature won’t do anything until Jackson County renews the 3/8-percent sales tax,” Sharp said. “There is no reason why the state needs to wait. The state could move forward with this legislation as it currently stands. They’re just choosing not to.”
“You have people — mainly Republicans — who looked at the failed vote last year and think, ‘Oh well, people must not want these sports teams anymore,’ which could not be further from the truth,” Sharp added.
Citing conversations with his constituents and other local residents, Sharp believes most residents want the teams to stay in the county, ideally at their current stadium locations. The April 2024 ballot question had included a proposal for a new Royals stadium in downtown Kansas City.
“Most folks who paid any attention know that the vote failed last year because people didn’t want a Royals stadium where they were trying to put it, not because we don’t want professional sports teams in our city,” Sharp said. “It was a shame those two things were coupled together.”
After voters rejected the proposal to build a new Royals stadium at a site in the Crossroads, Kansas City officials began exploring the possibility of a new stadium at Washington Square Park instead.
A local firm entered a contract to buy part of the site and began working with investors to get the pieces in place to pitch the new location to the Royals. After eight months with no concrete commitment from the team, the firm decided to terminate its contract.
Jackson County — which is currently mired in a battle over the county budget — will not be able to get something over the finish line in time and hasn’t shown interest in doing so, Sharp said.
Asked why, he replied, “Dysfunction.”
The Truman Sports Complex opened in 1972-73 and both teams have a lease that expires in 2031 with the Jackson County Sports Complex Authority (Courtesy/Jackson County Sports Complex Authority).
Because the Chiefs set a deadline of June 20 — when they want to be able to announce a decision about future stadium plans — the path forward looks “rough,” Sharp said.
“June? We’re not going to have anything done by June. June? That’s almost like a slap in the face. There’s no way we can get anything done by June,” he said.
Caleb Clifford, the chief of staff for Jackson County Executive Frank White Jr., said that while White had been involved in discussions with the Chiefs and Royals, “there are not active discussions happening right now.”
However, he said it is probable that the teams are involved in discussions with members of the county Legislature.
“That is part of what led us to the situation that we had last year where they stopped talking with the administration because they weren’t getting the answers they wanted, then they went to the Legislature and got everything they wanted and more,” he said.
Clifford said that since White hadn’t supported the initial plan out of concern that the county and residents would bear a disproportionate burden, the vote only affirmed his opposition to the plan. But he said White was open to working with the teams and other stakeholders to create a new plan and put the question on the ballot again in the future.
“The county executive’s position has been clear from the beginning. We will not start planning for an election until we have an agreement in place, and at this point, that agreement’s not in place,” Clifford said. “Once that happens, we will work collectively with the teams and other interested parties to determine the best timing of an election.”
Asked what the plan would need to look like, Clifford said, “It would have to be a detailed plan that’s substantive and provides significant benefits to the community while balancing the amount of investment that the taxpayers are making to these facilities.”
White “is not interested in moving forward with the status quo,” Clifford added. “He believes that Jackson County deserves better, and he thinks they can get better.”
 A Clay County alternative

Another bill before the Missouri legislature has gotten considerably more traction. It would establish a Clay County Sports Authority, a regulatory body responsible for developing and maintaining sports and other event venues in the county.
Identical bills were sponsored by Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, Sen. Kurtis Gregory, a Marshall Republican, and Rep. Bill Allen, a Kansas City Republican.
Since the Royals began looking at potential sites for a new stadium, Clay County has vied to be a contender and has pushed to create a sports authority to help it work with and attract the team, Nurrenbern said.
She said a new stadium — which she and others in the county envision as a Wrigley Field-esque ballpark district, with shops and restaurants surrounding the facility — would bring new life to 70 acres of predominantly industrial land in North Kansas City and drive economic development in the area.
North Kansas City has also been proposed as a location for a new Royals ballpark with surrounding development (Rendering courtesy of Populous).
“When we look at a sports team, the reality is there are hundreds of people employed by those teams,” she said. “Eighty-two games a year brings in a lot of people to your area, people who are going to stop and grab a bite to eat (or) run by a grocery store and (get things to) have a tailgate.”
Jerry Nolte, presiding commissioner of the Clay County Commission, has visited Jefferson City several times this session to testify in favor of the sports authority legislation. He’s been very encouraged by the lack of pushback on the proposal, which was recently passed by the Senate and voted out of a House committee.
The Royals recently polled Clay County residents about whether they would support the team coming to the county, as well as a new sales tax to help fund stadium construction.
The poll’s findings are not yet publicly available, but Nurrenbern said her “understanding is that the polling results have been favorable.”
Nurrenbern — who said she has not been in touch with either team this legislative session — said constituents “reach out constantly about this,” with many “interested in learning more.”
“Many of them shared reservations about spending significant state revenue on the stadium when, for example, the governor’s (budget) proposal didn’t fully fund the (public school) foundation formula. We fund a lot of our social services at rates lower than nearly every other state in the nation,” she said. “A lot of my constituents wanted to make sure that we continue to make investments in vital services and really were hesitant to see any state funding go towards the stadium.”
Nurrenbern said she understood and shared these concerns, which is why she did not ask for any funding to be appropriated in the 2026 budget for the Clay County Sports Authority. But if the bill passes, the sports authority would legally be able to get upwards of $3 million annually from the state legislature.
She also said she understood constituents’ concerns about giving financial incentives to teams specifically.
“While I get that some might have frustrations about why we make special exceptions for professional sports teams, if we were talking about any other type of business that employs hundreds of (people) and injects millions and millions of dollars into our revenue every year, we would certainly be having those conversations about how to keep them here,” she said.
The path forward should be put to a vote, Nurrenbern said.
“It’s up to our county commissioners to put it to a vote of the people. I think voters deserve a voice in this,” she said. “If this is something they want for their region, this is something they should be able to think about and make a decision (on) at the ballot box.”
Nolte said he and other county officials are planning to “open the process up” for more public comment once the team makes a decision.
“I would hate to build up people’s hopes and then not be able to deliver,” Nolte said. “If we should continue forward on this, we need to have as much public input as we possibly can.”
If the bill is passed and signed into law, Nolte said he didn’t think there would be a “terribly long process” to get the authority established and operating. From there, he said, the county would need to figure out what funding a new stadium in the Northland would look like.
He said solid numbers about cost and other factors are needed to know what the best approach could be, but said one option would be a sales tax, which would have to be approved by voters.
“I think it’s certainly doable,” he said. “We need to make sure that we are able to provide (residents) with information that would convince people that this was indeed a benefit to them, but I think there’s a good deal of excitement.”
Nolte said that had the sales tax vote succeeded in Jackson County, “we might not be having this conversation. But here we are.”
Nurrenbern said she’s tried to push back against the idea that Clay County’s efforts are creating a competition between it and its southern neighbor.
“This is simply another option for the teams, (so) that if they choose to move north, we have this in place for them,” she said. “I always wanted to make clear that this wasn’t going to be Clay vs. Jackson. It’s up to the Royals to choose where they want to move their team.”
Nolte said he doesn’t see it as a competition between counties, either.
“We very much look at this in terms of being a team, part of a Missouri solution to retain the teams,” he said. “We’re all just trying to put out the best set of options to keep these institutions in Missouri and to keep that economic engine and those jobs here in Missouri.”
 A Kansas stadium solution

As different governments and groups on the Missouri side of the border work to keep the teams in the Show-Me State, the Sunflower State last year made its move to attract the teams, passing a law during an emergency session to enable the use of STAR bonds to help cover the cost of building new stadiums.
STAR bonds — or sales tax and revenue bonds — are used to pay for tourist attractions and are paid off through sales taxes on products sold at those sites and nearby businesses. For a new sports stadium, that could include taxes on tickets, food and merchandise.
Manica Architecture last year created renderings for a potential domed stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs in Kansas (Rendering courtesy of Manica Architecture).
The bonds have been marketed as a way to cover upwards of 70% of the cost of a new stadium without diverting taxpayer dollars from the state’s general revenue fund. But they still divert a portion of state revenue that might have otherwise been used to pay for public services.
While the Kansas Department of Commerce said most of the state’s STAR bond-funded projects are expected to be paid off early — including Children’s Mercy Park, home of Sporting KC — a 2021 audit found some projects may need over a century to do so, and several prominent projects have in recent years defaulted on their bonds.
The 2021 audit also found most STAR bond projects in Kansas haven’t drawn much out-of-state tourism, limiting their ability to generate enough tax revenue to pay off their bonds in a timely manner.
Given the potential limitations of Kansas’ plan, Sharp said he believes Missouri legislative leaders and other lawmakers “are just hoping that Kansas can’t or won’t follow through on what they proposed.”
“We’re not taking a position of being aggressive. We’re taking a position of being passive, which I think will ultimately have us end up looking like St. Louis,” he said, referring to the Rams NFL team, which moved from St. Louis to Los Angeles in 2016.
Sharp said that despite his efforts, the teams “won’t speak to us.”
“They haven’t spoken with me. They haven’t spoken with folks in the Democratic caucus. They probably have talked with the (Kansas City) mayor. They probably have talked to the Jackson County (Legislature’s) Chairperson DaRon McGee. They probably have talked to some other folks. But they haven’t talked to anybody in Jeff City about (our) bill,” he said.
Gov. Mike Kehoe and legislative leaders hosted a closed-door meeting in February to discuss the situation with Kansas City and Jackson County officials. The teams were not present at the discussion.
Kehoe — who also met with representatives from the Royals in February — in January told reporters he is “not a fan of just throwing money at stadiums, but I’m a fan of keeping the economic activity that those two teams provide, and we’re going to continue to work and put our best foot forward to make sure they stay.”

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, is again attempting to add a third Idaho federal district court judge — as part of a broader judgeship expansion bill.
In 1954, Congress approved a second federal district judgeship for Idaho, which has been one of the fastest-growing states in recent years. Since then, Idaho’s population has more than tripled to over 2 million residents.
In 2021, the Associated Press reported Idaho had the fewest federal judges of any state. 
Simpson’s office announced Thursday the longtime congressman has cosponsored the JUDGES Act.
Over the next decade, the bill would create 63 permanent judgeships, including adding a new federal district judgeship in Idaho, Simpson’s office said.
“With Idaho’s growing population comes greater pressure on our courts and an increase in cases,” Simpson said in a written statement. “Adding a third district judgeship will help reduce backlogs and ensure Idahoans receive timely justice. This solution will strengthen our judicial system and better serve the people of Idaho.”
The new bill is similar to another bill Congress passed, and former President Joe Biden vetoed in December. 
Simpson has attempted other legislation to add a third Idaho federal district court judge, including a bill introduced in January with U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho.

(Photo courtesy USAO)The United States Attorney in New Mexico announced Thursday that 82 people are facing brand new criminal charges aimed at cracking down on illegal crossings where Mexico shares a border with New Mexico.
A recent land transfer from the Department of Interior to the Department of Defense effectively made the 170-mile stretch of United States-Mexico border in southwest New Mexico into a military base, authorizing federal troops to detain and transfer individuals to federal law enforcement for criminal charges, according to a news release. 
Those who are arrested in the 60-foot buffer zone can face charges for “unauthorized entry into the New Mexico National Defense Areas,” according to charging documents, a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison. 
The names of the 82 individuals charged were not immediately available, though federal court records show that U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison, who was named as the United States Attorney for New Mexico on April 18, personally signed 28 charging documents for named defendants on April 28.

“The Department of Justice will work hand in glove with the Department of Defense and Border Patrol to gain 100% operational control of New Mexico’s 170-mile border with Mexico,” Ellison said in a news release. “Trespassers into the National Defense Area will be Federally prosecuted—no exceptions.”
United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Border Patrol Chief Michael Banks joined Ellison for a “high-level visit” April 25. They touted the newly created criminal charge as a way to leverage “expanded military and prosecutorial authority to deter unlawful border crossings,” according to the news release.
Standing on the newly created National Defense Area in New Mexico on April 25, Hegseth warned that anyone caught there would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
If you try to come in illegally as a cartel, or you try to smuggle or traffic. You will be detained by a member the U.S. military, and you will be handed over to US Customs and Border Patrol, and then you will be prosecuted by the US DOJ, and then you will be charged to the maximum extent of the law,” Hegseth said, according to video he posted to social media. 
The buffer zone along the U.S.-Mexico border in New Mexico, Arizona and California is known as the “Roosevelt Reservation” and excludes areas of private or tribal land. Now that it’s under control of the Defense Department, it’s treated as an extension of the U.S. Army Garrison Fort Huachaca in Cochise County, Arizona.
Rebecca Sheff, an attorney with the ACLU of New Mexico, said in an April 22 news release that the newly created military buffer zone “represents a dangerous erosion of the constitutional principle that the military should not be policing civilians.” She also said U.S. citizens who live near the border could be prosecuted under the newly created statutes.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image001-e1746120014744-1024x1003.jpg,,,2025-05-01 14:11:13.570334

(Photo by Nancy Ostergaard/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Whether to close state government offices and universities in Richland and Lexington counties will be up to the governor under an executive order signed Thursday.
State policy has traditionally been for agencies to follow the lead of county officials on deciding whether to close local offices during snow, hurricanes and other hazardous weather conditions. That will remain the case in all other counties in the state, according to a Thursday news release from the governor’s office.
But in the two counties where most state agencies are headquartered, that policy “risks creating confusion for employees and the general public and unnecessarily impeding state government operations,” the executive order reads.
Different counties consider different factors in deciding whether to close.
With the move of several state agencies to Lexington County, giving the governor final decision-making powers, in consultation with emergency management officials, will ensure consistency across state government headquarters, McMaster said in a statement.
“This change will also ensure that citizens in all parts of the state have consistent access to the critical state government services their tax dollars pay for, especially during emergencies,” McMaster’s statement continued.
Richland County is home to the state capital. Agencies that have moved across the county line to Lexington County in the last year include the Department of Education. The new home for multiple health agencies also sits in the adjacent county.
The order comes after a snafu between the governor and the University of South Carolina during a spate of winter weather in January.
Following the lead of Richland County’s government offices, USC announced it would close its Columbia campus before reversing course following a statement from the governor directing all state agencies in Richland and Lexington counties to remain open.
However, McMaster’s concern about that sort of situation predated that directive, according to the governor’s office.
McMaster asked the Department of Administration in November to review the state’s policies on handling extreme weather. In a study returned in March, the agency recommended adopting the hybrid approach that McMaster instituted Thursday, his office said.
The order doesn’t take away agency directors’ ability to designate essential employees who must continue coming to work during emergencies. It also does not change a policy requiring state workers to work from home during closures when possible, according to the governor’s office.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/flooding-from-nancy-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-01 13:21:15.849057

Dean Rummel, R-Dickinson, speaks on the Senate floor next to Sen. Diane Larson, R-Bismarck, on May 1, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The Senate defeated a bill Thursday that would have expanded income tax cuts to more North Dakotans. 
Senate Bill 2093, unanimously adopted by the Senate in January, initially sought to provide an income tax exemption on law enforcement retirement benefits for surviving spouses. 
The House amended the bill to increase the number of taxpayers who pay zero income tax, expanding income tax cuts lawmakers approved two years ago. The proposal sought to add about 9,500 more taxpayers to the zero tax bracket, estimated to cost about $20 million for 2025-27.
Rep. Jared Hagert, R-Emerado, a member of the bill’s conference committee, said House lawmakers have always been “steadfast” on reducing income tax for North Dakotans.
“The best way to provide relief to North Dakotans is to not take it out of their pocket in the first place,” Hagert said. 
But Sen. Dean Rummel, R-Dickinson, also a member of the conference committee, urged senators to vote no. He said the Senate’s position on the conference committee was that no one is asking for a reduction in state income taxes.
“We all know the demand is for more property tax relief,” he said.
Rummel also raised concerns about the affordability of further income tax cuts.
“There are so many concerns that we express, like the impact on the national and state economy with our current administration, the price of oil and the state’s reliance on carbon fuels,” Rummel said. “There’s also talk of a possible recession.”
Sen. Scott Meyer, R-Grand Forks, said he supports cutting income taxes as a way to recruit businesses and investment to the state.
“This is a small step toward the goal of eventually becoming a no income tax state,” Meyer said.
Senate members voted against the bill with a 35-11 vote.
Sen. Diane Larson, R-Bismarck, chief sponsor of the bill, said the Senate had already rejected a previous bill that reduced income taxes.
“So they amended that bill into this bill because they saw this as a good bill that maybe could get their bill across the line,” Larson said. “This is the kind of thing that I think is extremely frustrating, not only for the public, but for other lawmakers like me, too.”
Larson said she’s disappointed that widows and widowers of retired law enforcement will not see the income tax exemption she proposed, but hopes lawmakers will revisit it next session.
In 2023, North Dakota lawmakers eliminated state income taxes for lower earners and reduced tax rates for higher earners. Legislators continue to debate expanding a property tax credit for primary residences in the final days of the session.

Adient will permanently close its facilities in Henderson and Maury counties by June 27, according to notices submitted to the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development earlier this month.
The company began layoffs of the 95 workers at its Columbia manufacturing facility in Maury County on April 17. Layoffs of the 320 workers at its Lexington plant in Henderson County began April 21.
Adient operates three other Tennessee manufacturing plants in Athens, Murfreesboro, and Pulaski, according to its website. A representative for Adient could not be immediately reached for comment.
Employees at the Columbia plant are represented by United Automobile Workers Local 1853 in Spring Hill. Union representatives were not immediately available to comment. Lexington facility employees did not have union representation. The Southwest Local Workforce Development Area rapid response team will coordinate services for affected employees, according to the notices.
Adient invested $23.5 million to expand its Lexington facility in 2020, pledging to grow its workforce there to 330 employees. It was the company’s second “significant investment” in Henderson County since 2018, according to a January 2020 announcement from the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD).
About 8,000 people lived in Lexington in 2020, according to the census. Lexington Mayor Jeff Griggs declined to answer questions about the closure, but said in a statement that “the City of Lexington is committed to providing resources and support to those impacted by this closure.” 
State records show the company was offered $2.5 million in grants for its first expansion of the Lexington facility in 2018.
The state’s economic development arm offered Adient a $155,000 grant for a 62-employee expansion at its Murfreesboro plant in 2024 and a $90,000 grant for a 90-employee expansion at the Columbia facility in 2019.
A representative for TNECD did not immediately respond to a request for more details on the grant agreements.
Open positions remained posted on Adient’s website for its Murfreesboro and Pulaski locations as of 3 p.m. Wednesday.
The company will host a conference call on May 7 at 8:30 a.m. eastern time to discuss its 2025 second-quarter finances.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis wants the Department of Homeland Security to grant the state’s emergency management agency authority to temporarily house immigrants detained for deportation.
The governor floated this idea during a press conference with federal immigration officials, praising Kevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, for his ability to move resources during hurricanes.
DeSantis and officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection claimed a large-scale operation, nicknamed Tidal Wave, in the state last week resulted in 1,120 arrests.
“We have the capacity to set it up quickly, but we’re not going to do that without the approval of the Department of Homeland Security, and I know they’re working on exactly what they want to do after Tidal Wave. This is what they have focused on,” DeSantis said at the ICE office in Miramar.
“So, Kevin Guthrie, Division of Emergency Management, they can actually absolutely do that, and that could be potentially a short-term support for the lack of space that the feds may have.”
Guthrie attended the press conference but didn’t speak. The emergency agency’s X account posted that its staff participated in Operation Tidal Wave.
Another idea DeSantis pushed for is to deputize military judicial officials within the Florida National Guard to act as immigration judges under the U.S. Department of Justice.
Those plans are not new, though. Larry Keefe, executive director of the new State Board of Immigration Enforcement, initially talked about them in a public meeting in March. Keefe, who organized Gov. Ron DeSantis’ migrant flight from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard in 2022, views involvement by DEM as essential to enacting President Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations.
Orlando Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani criticized the idea of DEM housing immigrants when Keefe first mentioned it publicly.
“FDEM should be focused on responding to hurricanes and natural disasters — not engaging in immigration enforcement,” Eskamani said. “I will also add that the main beneficiary of this concept will be the for-profit private prison industry, who will receive our tax dollars to hold individuals without due process.”
Overcrowding at ICE centers
ICE already faces overcrowding in Florida detention centers. Immigrant-rights groups, detainees, and Democrats have raised alarms about conditions at detention centers in Miami and Pompano Beach.
Marie Ange Blaise, a 44-year-old from Haiti, died in ICE custody on Friday, according to a Tuesday announcement from ICE. Her cause of death is under investigation.
Meanwhile, ICE acknowledged a temporary structure at the Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami that Democratic U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson described as a tent city that could house 400 people. Wilson and Democratic U.S. Rep Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick announced plans for a visit Friday to the Pompano Beach ICE center.

Mai Xiong (D-Warren), after she criticized Hall for canceling a legislative session set for Tuesday, the same day President Donald Trump came to Michigan for a rally attended by Hall to mark the President’s first 100 days in office. 
“We have this very low IQ representative named Mai Xiong, probably one of the dumbest ones in the Legislature, and I saw this video of her, and she’s like ‘the House Speaker is not here today. We need to have session. You know? We need to work for the people of Michigan, Macomb County,’” Hall said. “Well, where was I? While she’s doing nothing for her county and for her district. I was in Macomb County, right near her district, delivering a new mission with President Trump for Selfridge Air Force Base. So I hope she thanks me. That would be nice. Wouldn’t it be nice if Mai Xiong made a video thanking me because she’s not doing anything anyway.”

Hours after the press conference concluded, Xiong responded, posting a video which included Hall’s remarks and releasing a statement shortly after. 
“I am deeply disheartened and disappointed by the recent remarks made by the Speaker of the Michigan House…These words weren’t just disrespectful — they were meant to demean, belittle, and devalue,” Xiong said in her statement before criticizing Hall’s leadership decisions. 
“Let me be clear: What’s truly dumb is passing a state House bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico, a body of water thousands of miles away from Michigan and a waste of taxpayer dollars,” Xiong said. “What’s truly dumb is violating the Michigan Constitution by hijacking nine bills passed by the legislature, including one I authored to support our public workers, and blocking them from reaching the governor’s desk while pretending to hold veto power he simply doesn’t have.”
Following a tumultuous lame duck session — where Senate Democrats worked through a record-setting 29 hour session to advance policies before House Republicans took control of the chamber, ending Democrats trifecta in Lansing — nine bills passed during that session have been held in limbo, after former House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) failed to present the votes to the governor. 
Senate Democrats have since taken legal action against the House to compel Hall to present the bills. While Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel determined that the state Constitution requires House leadership to submit the bills to the governor, she declined to order Hall to do so, as state courts have previously declined to enforce legislative rules.
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) sought to bring the case directly to the Michigan Supreme Court. However, the Court declined to hear the case, instead ordering the Michigan Court of Appeals to “expedite its consideration and resolution of this case.”
Xiong’s bill, House Bill 6058, would increase the amount public employers can contribute towards employees’ health insurance plans. 
In her statement, Xiong further criticized Hall for taking credit for securing additional fighter jets at Selfridge Air National Guard Base. 
“While the Speaker uses the press and platform of the Speakership to tear others down, let me remind him, and the people of Michigan — who I am,” Xiong said. “I am a mother of four young children who will one day ask me why the highest elected official in the House called their mom dumb and ‘low IQ.’ I am a refugee and immigrant who came here seeking freedom. I am a daughter, sister, a wife, a friend. I am the first Hmong American elected — and currently only Asian American woman in the Michigan House of Representatives.”

Josh Shapiro's proposal for a statewide tuition rate for cyber charter schools. (Stock photo by Getty Images)Educators say they’ve seen measurable improvements in student achievement and well-being in the school districts where Pennsylvania targeted a half billion dollars to reduce educational disparities, according to a new report.
The adequacy funding, provided as the first installment in a $4.5 billion settlement with advocates for fair public education funding, has allowed districts to hire and retain essential staff such as reading and math specialists, increase teacher salaries and purchase curricula and other resources. 
“State adequacy funding and other recent increases in state education dollars have given Pennsylvania school districts critical financial stability and new capacity to invest directly in student success and well being,” Nelson Suarez, a fourth grade teacher in the Manheim Township School District in Lancaster County, said.
But educators and advocates say excessive payments to online-only charter schools threaten to negate the progress those districts have made. As lawmakers square up to negotiate the next state budget by the end of next month, they also hope to pass legislation to set a statewide tuition rate and require accountability, following an audit that found five cyber charters, including state’s largest, amassed excessive reserves of state tax dollars.
“If there is no cyber charter reform this year and the rest of the dollars go through, there will be districts that will be further behind, starting in the fall, than they were last year. 100%. Absolutely, no question about it,” Susan Spicka, executive director of Education Voters PA, said during the news conference this week held by Teach Plus, a teacher-led education policy group.
According to Education Voters, tuition paid by school districts to cyber charter schools roughly doubled to $1 billion between 2018 and 2023 as parents sought online education for their children during the pandemic.
Members of the House Education Committee, where the Democratic majority plans to renew efforts for reform, said they’re hopeful bipartisan support for a statewide tuition rate in the lower chamber will carry through to the Republican-controlled Senate.
“I think there is an appetite in our constrained budget that we want to be certain adequate funding is getting to our schools and students and not lacing the pocketbooks of charter schools,” said Rep. Mary Louise Isaacson (D-Philadelphia), who is drafting charter reform legislation. Rep. Joe Ciresi (D-Montgomery) has proposed a similar bill.
Two years ago, Commonwealth Court President Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer ended a decade of litigation by some of the state’s most disadvantaged school districts and parents of students by finding the state’s education funding system’s reliance on property taxes to be unconstitutional.
“Specifically, it discriminated against students … whose local districts don’t have the property wealth to be able to essentially close a shortfall that the state has created by under investing in our public schools at the state level,” Laura Boyce, executive director of Teach Plus Pennsylvania, said.
The historic court ruling made clear that the General Assembly and governor were responsible to find a solution, but didn’t provide instructions. Over several months, an inter-branch Basic Education Funding Commission held hearings and gathered data to develop recommendations on how to close the funding gap.
Acting on the recommendations, the legislature reached an agreement with the advocacy groups who litigated the case in which the state would increase funding over the next nine years for 348 school districts where per pupil spending fell below that of the commonwealth’s most successful districts. It would also provide additional funding for tax relief in the districts that taxed property owners the most in efforts to keep up.
Norristown Area School District Superintendent Christopher Dormer said with prior years’ supplements and $10 million in additional funding the district received this school year, it has been able to add 140 staff positions that have allowed smaller class sizes, added more than 20 reading specialists and provided mental health support for students, families and staff.
“Now, part of that story is the 140 positions have also overcome almost a decade-and-a-half of program reduction, staff curtailments and raising taxes and spending down fund balance,” Dormer said.
As a result, elementary math proficiency has increased 10 percentage points and middle school math proficiency increased 5 percentage points, Dormer said. Others among the teachers and administrators quoted in the report said they’ve seen decreases in disciplinary issues and truancy.
“The results are not surprising, nor should they be surprising when you adequately and appropriately fund public schools, success happens, and we’ve done this without raising local taxes for four consecutive years,” he said, adding that over the previous 12 years, taxes increased 40%.
Gov. Josh Shapiro’s 2025-2026 budget proposal calls for another $526 million toward the $4.5 billion  adequacy goal. It would also increase basic education funding that all districts receive by $75 million to more than $8.2 billion and special education funding would increase $40 million to more than $1.5 billion.
It also highlights the need for legislation to set the tuition for public school students attending cyber charter schools at $8,000, which Shapiro said better aligns with the actual cost of providing an online education. A statewide tuition would save school districts an estimated $378 million annually, the governor’s office said.
A measure to do that passed the House last year with strong bipartisan support, but was not considered in the Senate. The budget did set aside $100 million to reimburse districts for charter school tuition and made adjustments to the formula used to calculate special education rates.
However, the state continues to use the method to calculate tuition devised when cyber charter schools were first permitted more than a quarter century ago. That results in widely inconsistent rates paid by different districts, ranging from about $8,000 to $29,000 per student for regular education students to up to $63,000 per student for special education. 
Critics say the varying tuition rates have resulted in overpayments former Gov. Tom Wolf’s office estimated at $400 million a year.
In February, Republican state Auditor General Timothy DeFoor released an audit of five cyber charter schools that found their fund balances had increased 144% collectively between 2020 and 2023.
While it found the cyber charter schools acted within the law, it highlighted “uncommon” spending practices such as purchasing gift cards, paying bonuses to teachers and the acquisition of 21 physical properties by Commonwealth Charter Academy, the state’s largest cyber school.
House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) told the Capital-Star he sees the issues with cyber charter schools as multifaceted, with tuition rates being only one of them. Schweyer said he agrees with Shapiro that a statewide rate is needed and is open to negotiating, adding $8,000 is a good starting point.
But Schweyer said the most pressing issue is cyber charter schools’ poor performance on statewide assessments. He noted less than 5% of Commonwealth Charter Academy students scored proficient or advanced in math, which is far below the state average of 40%.
“In what universe should we be paying hundreds of millions of dollars to schools that can’t teach their students basic math skills?” Schweyer said.
Rep. Bryan Cutler (R-Lancaster), the ranking Republican on the Education Committee, said he opposes legislation that would reduce access to alternatives to traditional public education. 
“I believe that cyber charter schools provide a fair opportunity for all students, especially those in underperforming schools, and that this legislation would hurt them more than help our finances,” Cutler said. 
Cutler added he would prefer to see reforms focused elsewhere, such as more opportunities for technical education and dual enrollment for high school students.
But Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said in a policy position statement last month that he believes that criticism of cyber charter schools have merit. 
The state made progress last year, Pittman said, with tuition reimbursement and other ethics and accountability reforms. They include requiring financial statements, prohibiting conflicts of interest, reporting requirements for advertising and sponsorships and mandating wellness checks for students.
“However there is an opportunity for more to be done,” he said, noting scrutiny of cyber charter reserves, greater accuracy in tuition calculations and meaningful truancy reforms are all worthy of discussion as lawmakers debate the next budget.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/school_stock-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 13:21:15.849057

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/01/ct-nursing-home-strike-seiu-1199/,"SEIU 1199NE wants to boost starting pay for nursing home workers in CT to $25 per hour and, over several years, to about $30 per hour.","The state’s largest health care workers union on Thursday set a May 19 deadline for state officials to avert a strike involving about 5,700 caregivers at 51 nursing homes across Connecticut.
SEIU 1199NE is seeking to boost starting pay for workers to $25 per hour and, over several years, elevate most employees to about $30 per hour, said union president Rob Baril. But to make that happen, he added, the state will need to make a significant and long overdue investment in the industry.
After “almost 20 years of austerity,” Baril said, “you can’t solve the problems that exist for publicly funded workers with nickels and dimes. To make progress, it takes real money.”
Most nursing home workers currently earn between $18 and $22 per hour, and the union leader said some could earn more money working at McDonald’s. 
Equally important, he said, insufficient state funding is weakening the quality of care in an industry that’s been struggling for years. Legislators are weighing a bill to raise the daily minimum staffing requirement from three to 3.6 hours per resident each day.
Though wage and benefit negotiations technically are between private sector nursing homes and their staff, the state often plays a role in resolving labor-management disputes in this industry.
That’s because, on average, more than 80% of nursing home revenue involves patients whose care is covered by federal and state Medicaid dollars. 
The union estimates it would require an extra $550 million in Medicaid payments over the next two fiscal years combined, an annual average of $275 million, to fund the improved wages and benefits workers are seeking.
About 50% of Connecticut’s Medicaid expenses in most areas currently are covered through federal reimbursement, which would make the effective annual cost to the state about $137.5 million.
But the future of Medicaid is far from certain.
Congress set a goal of achieving cuts to Medicaid and other programs worth $880 billion over the next decade. Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration has modeled potential cuts, based on various proposals on Capitol Hill, that could cost Connecticut anywhere from $186 million to $880 million per year.
Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly are already struggling to develop a new state budget that complies with the constitutional cap that keeps most spending growth in line with household income and inflation.
The Appropriations Committee last week recommended a $55.7 billion two-year budget that invests in K-12 schools, child care and other social services — but would require Connecticut to legally exceed the cap by $215 million. Lamont, a Democrat, has challenged lawmakers to live within the cap, and minority Republicans oppose the plan.
The governor and legislature hope to craft a new state budget before the regular General Assembly session adjourns on June 4.
The union, which originally projected in late March that a strike might involve as many as 6,000 workers at 60 homes, has asked members over the last few weeks to empower union leaders to order a work stoppage — if leaders deem insufficient progress has occurred in negotiations.
Final vote totals still are being tabulated, but Baril estimated about 99% of ballots cast favored giving leaders that option.
He added there is little hope for a settlement with nursing facility owners absent much greater state spending.
“What [owners] are telling us is ‘We don’t have any money,’” Baril said.
Though state law technically requires specific Medicaid rate hikes that reflect inflation, legislators and governors have offered no or lesser increases for decades. Lamont’s $55.2 billion biennial state budget proposal would eliminate $111.4 million in inflationary increases over the next two fiscal years combined.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, has said a recent Department of Social Services analysis of Medicaid rates shows Connecticut’s funding levels compare favorably with states of comparable size and income levels. 
“There must be a significant and ongoing state investment to address the workforce and the operational needs in the skilled nursing facility sector,” Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, told the Connecticut Mirror in late March. “There’s been significant financial instability in the sector since the COVID-19 public health emergency.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0501_SR_SEIURally_068-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 13:21:15.849057

(Rendering courtesy of Smith Entertainment Group)The Utah Hockey Club wrapped its first season in a temporarily modified Delta Center in Salt Lake City this year. Now, Smith Entertainment Group, which owns the state’s NHL franchise, unveiled how it would remodel the arena to permanently accommodate hockey and basketball.
One of the main events in the transformation is the implementation of a retractable seating system in the Utah arena’s lower bowl “that accommodates a nearly 12-foot variance in elevation between rink and court endlines to offer optimal sightlines for both the NBA and NHL,” according to a news release. It’s a first of its kind in a dual-use arena, Smith Entertainment Group said of the feature.
With the hockey configuration, there will also be added capacity behind the goals and above and around the event tunnels on the north and south side of the lower bowl. For basketball, the riser system will have 29 rows of retractable seats that are able to extend over 28 feet.
Ryan and Ashley Smith, co-founders of Smith Entertainment group, said in a statement that while adding an ice rink inside an arena designed to host basketball is challenging — since the rink must be nearly double the size of a basketball court — they are excited to get started on the challenge.
“This transformation will create the most compelling, welcoming, and exciting experience for hockey fans, while also allowing us to maintain the steep vertical seating for basketball that has made Delta Center such a dynamic venue with its loud atmosphere that energizes our players night after night,” the Smiths said.
  This graphic shows the proposed seating sightlines at the Delta Center, which will house professional hockey and basketball.
 Utah Legislature passed 2024 bill to create sports, entertainment district in SLC

With these renovations, the Delta Center is expected to increase its seating capacity from 11,131 to about 17,000 for hockey, and from 18,206 seats to nearly 19,000 for the Utah Jazz.
This is a major part of what Senate Bill 272, a 2024 bill that created a sports and entertainment district in Salt Lake City’s downtown, intended. The legislation allowed the city to start collecting a 0.5% sales tax increase for 30 years to raise about $900 million for the arena’s renovations as well as redevelopment for three blocks of the neighborhood.
Smith Entertainment Group estimates that $525 million will be used on the remodel of the Delta Center and $375 million will go to cover costs to develop the district. While the deal with the state and the city includes a participation agreement in which the company committed to fund programs and spaces for the public, Salt Lakers remained divided on whether taxpayer dollars should be used for this endeavor.
Ultimately, the city signed onto the agreement. And, after the 2025 legislative session, the state created more tools to fund renovations to the Salt Palace Convention Center, also a landmark of the downtown district.

On Tuesday, the Salt Lake County Council voted unanimously to approve selling 6.5 acres of county-owned property — between South Temple and 100 South, and 200 and 300 West — to Smith Entertainment Group.
The area hosts an exhibit hall space at the convention center and it’s surrounded by the Delta Center, Japantown, Abravanell Hall, the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art and City Creek Center, according to a release.
“This is more than a land transaction — it’s a catalyst for long-term growth, a stronger downtown, and significant benefits to residents across Salt Lake County,” Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson said in a statement. “The redevelopment of this property will generate millions in tax revenue, attract major national and international events, and ensure Salt Lake City remains a premier destination for sports, entertainment, cultural events and tourism.”
Construction starts this summer for the Delta Center remodel, but it will take multiple years to complete, with work being done during the summer when the teams are off-season. The plans also include an east-side entrance to connect with the downtown district, and a new parking garage at the back of the arena.

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)A bill to raise the top speed limit to 80 mph in North Dakota failed by two votes Thursday in the House of Representatives. 
The interstate speed limit change had previously passed the House but House Bill 1298 was later amended to increase speeding fines and other changes. 
The bill needed 48 votes to pass and received 46 votes in favor with 45 against with three members absent. 
House votes to increase North Dakota interstate speeds to 80 mph

Rep. Mike Schatz, R-New England, spoke against the bill, saying most truckers were against the higher speed limit on interstate highways. 
The bill could still be revived in the final days of the session, if a House member on the prevailing side of the vote asks for the bill to be reconsidered or an absent member asks for another vote. 
A conference committee met several times to find a compromise on speeding fines that would both moderately increase fines and create a simpler formula for calculating fines. The six-member committee passed the compromise bill Tuesday on a 4-2 vote. 
The bill also would allow for varying the speed limit depending on the driving conditions in some areas. Bill sponsor Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, said this likely would have been tested on Interstate 94 in the Valley City area, though the North Dakota Highway Patrol would have had to find the funding for the variable speed signs. 
The bill also called for the Highway Patrol to study the point system associated with driving violations and the fees for traffic violations. 
Sen. Dean Rummel, R-Dickinson, said in a conference committee meeting that North Dakota’s fines would still be lower than surrounding states, even with the increases.  
Koppelman said some local officials had been calling for higher fines to deter speeding on residential streets.

He also expressed concern about severing of federal research grants to colleges and universities and dysfunction in Congress that inhibited manufacture of military hardware. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Dole Institute's YouTube channel)LAWRENCE — Former CIA director and defense secretary Robert Gates is convinced zealous decisions by President Donald Trump to fire thousands of federal government probationary employees wiped out a generation of personnel committed to public service at the national security agencies.
Gates, a Wichita native who served under eight presidents during his career, said during a question-and-answer forum Wednesday at the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas that the Trump administration’s dismissal of newly hired staff in the first 100 days of his term caused sustained damage.
“There has been harm,” he said. “The firing of probationary employees at defense and at CIA, I think, was a supremely bad idea and will have long-term consequences because who they have fired are all the young people. These people are really the future of these agencies. I worry this is going to discourage this sort of stratum of young people interested in public service.”
Trump fired probationary employees across the federal government based on assertions they had to be terminated due to poor performance. The dismissals have been challenged in court with some individuals ordered reinstated by federal judges. Most of these workers were lower-level staff, but some were experienced federal employees who recently transitioned to new positions.
Gates, who was recruited into the CIA while working on a master’s degree at Indiana University, was the only career officer in CIA’s history to rise from entry-level employee to director. He was the only secretary of defense in U.S. history to be asked to remain in that job by a newly elected president, moving from an appointment by Republican President George W. Bush to serve in the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama.
 
‘People die’
Gates said it would be “foolish to pretend” disruption among senior-level leadership at the Department of Defense under Trump hadn’t been a distraction. He said those individuals were preoccupied with questions about whether they would be terminated, who would replace ousted staff in the chain of command and how defense policy would be summarily altered.
The nation ought to be skeptical of people in government committed to a mantra in which they routinely made rapid decisions designed to crack the status quo, he said.
“That works in the private sector actually,” Gates said. “But if moving fast and breaking things means people don’t get their Social Security checks, that’s actually a problem. There is sort of this feeling on the outside, if only business people could get in and run the government, then everything would be okay. Well, the problem is government isn’t a business. If something breaks in the private sector, people lose money. If something breaks in the government, people die.”
He said a leadership style dedicated to smashing international institutions was a “formula for disaster.” No one in the Trump administration has publicly argued on behalf of the NATO alliance, spoke of the value of United Nations agencies or championed the World Trade Organization, he said. It was disappointing to watch as the Trump administration obliterated the U.S. Agency for International Development, he said.
Gates, who serves as chancellor of the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, said he was distressed Trump showed a willingness to undercut the system in which the federal government provided funding for basic research carried out at public and private universities. This innovation pact has incubated research talent and fueled gains in the U.S. economy, he said.
“It was worth the federal government investing money,” Gates said. “It was pretty efficient in many respects. Now, were there crazy projects that got funded over the past 25 years? You can bank on it. But, for the most part, they have propelled the United States ahead economically and in terms of our technical prowess that is the envy of the world.”
He said the stream of federal investment brought the world’s smartest people to the United States where a portion of immigrants established major U.S. companies.
“There’s already been damage because lots of research projects have been interrupted,” Gates said. “Fundamentally, if this research isn’t done in universities, it won’t get done. We will begin to lag technologically. We’re playing with the future here and my hope is this is a temporary disruption. Putting Humpty Dumpty back together again is going to have costs.”
He said social science faculty on college and university campuses could benefit from self-reflection about the tendency to offer one-sided instruction of history and government.
 
‘Disarray in America’
Gates was in Lawrence to participate in the KU Security Conference aimed at understanding China’s geopolitical objectives and how they influenced U.S. national security. He was asked by Dole Institute visiting fellow Jerry Seib to step into the shoes of Xi Jinping, president of the People’s Republic of China, and examine the political, military and economic landscape.
“Well, I think I’m in pretty good shape because my principal adversary is not. There is a lot of disarray in America,” Gates said.
He said Xi was leading the world’s second-largest economy and had built a massive military force, including a rapidly expanded Navy driven by huge investments in ship production. From 2017 to 2024, Gates said, China built 150 warships during a period in which the number of U.S. Navy ships remained static.
China has been wrestling with a demographic time bomb due to the one-child policy, a 21% unemployment rate among young people and unprecedented tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Gates said. Rigidity of a Chinese Communist Party that prioritized internal security over economic progress was a weakness, he said.
The one area of consensus among Republicans and Democrats in Congress was hostility toward China, Gates said, but that rhetoric in Washington, D.C., could be useful to Xi as he sought to rally domestic support.
“He’s probably prepared to be patient,” Gates said. “The last thing he can do is show weakness in dealing with the United States and President Trump. I think he must be worried about the possibility of significant unemployment in turning tens of millions of workers out of those factories that are not going to be delivering goods to the United States.”
Gates said it was unlikely a trade war would lead to armed conflict involving China and the United States. He said lack of open communication between the two governments should be a concern given China’s aspirations to control of Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea.
 
‘Gasbags’ in D.C.
The U.S. military industrial base has eroded at the same time China dedicated resources to expanding production of military hardware, Gates said. China possessed 250 times the ship-building capacity of the United States, he said. China holds more than half the global capacity to build ships while the United States possessed less than 1%, he said.
He said Congress was partly to blame because it had been 15 years since the House and Senate produced a regular budget for the Department of Defense. The approach made it difficult to comply with demands from politicians to be nimble in development of new technology or to create an effective military acquisition network, he said.
“You’ve got all these people making speeches up on the Hill about how slow the defense department is to integrate new technologies. You’ve got them all yelling and they’re waving their arms about the lack of ship-building capacity and so on. And they’ve not appropriated a single dollars to do anything,” Gates said.
He said the Department of Defense required authority to enter lengthy contracts for ship and ammunition manufacturing that couldn’t be broken in two or three years.
“The fundamental thing is for the gasbags in Washington to stop talking and start doing,” Gates said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gates-at-ku-1-1024x583.png,,,2025-05-01 12:21:11.755327

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Legislature will not vote on a budget for at least another 10 days, as leaders of each chamber say they’re still working on a deal.
The legislative session is set to end Friday but, without agreement on the only bill lawmakers must pass, they will have to come back to Tallahassee before July 1 to fund the government for the next fiscal year.
“We continue to have productive conversations with the House. We’re putting together a framework for a budget, and I’m optimistic that we’ll have more news to share very soon,” Senate President Ben Albritton told senators Thursday morning, adding that they need not plan on being in Tallahassee next week.
The two chambers started about $4.4 billion apart on total spending, reflecting different philosophies on tax cuts.
The initial House proposal targeted permanent sales tax cuts, while the initial Senate proposal emphasized sales tax cuts on inexpensive clothing and shoes plus tax holidays and a study on future property tax relief. Gov. Ron DeSantis has his own ideas, preferring a massive property tax rebate ahead of elimination of the tax through a ballot measure next year.
“Obviously, today is Day 59; as we get towards the end of the 60 days, we are still in conversations with the Senate,” House Speaker Daniel Perez told lawmakers, adding that they do not need to be in town next week.
Perez said the House will debate legislation Thursday and Friday as the remaining bills go back and forth in negotiations with the Senate.

Kyle Davison, R-Fargo, speaks on the Senate floor during the organizational session on Dec. 4, 2024. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The Senate on Thursday morning narrowly sustained Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s veto of a bill that opponents feared would allow the state to shift health insurance premium costs onto employees.
The vote to override the veto failed 31-15. The Senate needed 32 votes.
Senate Bill 2160, sponsored by Rep. Kyle Davison, R-Fargo, would have changed the state employee health care plan to comply with the federal Affordable Care Act. This change would be irreversible.
North Dakota governor vetoes bill to change state employee health insurance

In Armstrong’s veto message to the Senate, he called the state health insurance plan one of the “strongest and most useful recruitment and retention tools.” He said the bill “disposes of that tool and replaces it with a more expensive alternative.” 
A fiscal analysis of the bill estimated the plan would cost about $6.6 million for the 2025-2027 budget cycle and more than $25 million over the 2027-2029 biennium.
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Kyle Davison, R-Fargo, said the bill was important to modernize health insurance for state employees.
A major draw of the new plan is that it would give workers more free benefits, including preventive health care services like colonoscopy screenings and mammograms. It would also allow co-pays to count toward out-of-pocket maximums.
“Senate Bill 2160 is an opportunity,” Davison said. “The opportunity to increase the rate of preventive care and wellness visits, which could be to reduce spending over the long term.”
A prevailing concern, however, is that the bill would allow the state to start charging premiums to employees to offset the additional cost of the plan. Under the current plan, the state cannot charge premiums.
Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, said she voted in favor of the bill in committee but that she had since changed her mind because she believes the impacts of the policy change should be studied more carefully before it is implemented.
“I visited with the governor a couple of days ago, and his concerns were that people who are affected the most have not had nearly enough exposure to what this change makes,” Lee told her colleagues on the floor.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-01 15:46:57+00:00,CT Mirror,CT House Republicans offer $54.4 billion two-year budget plan,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/01/ct-house-republicans-budget-plan/,"The CT House Republicans' budget plan would trim electric rates, bolster schools, freeze wages and cut care for undocumented residents.","State House Republicans proposed a $54.4 billion two-year budget Thursday that would trim electric rates and bolster local schools, social services and child care, while cutting medical assistance for undocumented residents.
The plan, which would spend less than both Gov. Ned Lamont and majority Democratic legislators have proposed, also would freeze state employee wages for two years, require big savings from hiring limits and across-the-board cuts to all agencies, and force public colleges and universities to tap their robust reserves.
House Republicans would boost spending 3.8% next fiscal year and another 1.8% in 2026-27 and note their plan, unlike the $55.7 billion package the Democratic-controlled Appropriations Committee offered last week, would fall under the constitutional spending cap.
But the Republicans, whose plan falls $46 million under the cap in the first year and $929 million under in the second, needed some special help to get there. It would cancel a popular youth-in-poverty assistance program while shifting its funding — almost $381 million —outside of the budget and spending cap, an accounting maneuver that GOP lawmakers have decried in the past as a fiscal gimmick.
The House Republican budget avoids tax hikes and would allow up to $320 million in annual tax relief to residents and businesses, provided Connecticut successfully challenges New York over a disputed tax issue involving residents working for out-of-state employers.
“Our plan is rooted in reality — the reality that Connecticut families are already stretched thin by the high cost of living that’s driven by the cost of government,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. 
House Republicans, who likely face heavy pushback from the governor and his fellow Democrats in the legislature, offered their plan without endorsement or criticism from the Senate’s Republican minority, which has chosen not to propose any comprehensive fix to Connecticut’s challenging budget situation. 
Policymakers have found it increasingly difficult to adhere to a strict series of budget caps and have drained an average of $1.8 billion from programs over the past seven years. Meanwhile, legislators and Lamont also anticipate that ongoing congressional efforts to cut the federal budget could cost Connecticut hundreds of millions or even billions in annual assistance from Washington.
More dollars for K-12 education, social services – but not for higher ed
House Republicans and Democratic legislators do see eye-to-eye in several areas. 
The GOP budget and the Democrats’ $55.7 billion biennial spending package both add $84 million in special education aid for local K-12 schools in each of the next two fiscal years, on top of a $40 million increase the legislature approved in March.
Both parties also proposed an extra $26 million in funding over the next two years combined to ensure that about 80 communities would not face a reduction in Education Cost Sharing grants as called for under the state’s statutory formula. The system weighs local wealth, enrollment totals and past local education spending in calculating the state’s contribution.
And Democrats and House Republicans agreed that private nonprofit agencies that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored social services to people with disabilities would not face a funding cut next fiscal year.
But the parties differ when it comes to higher education.
The Appropriations Committee added about $280 million over the coming biennium to support the University of Connecticut and its Farmington-based health center, as well as $108 million to back regional state universities and community colleges.
Both of those gains, though, are filling holes left by expiring pandemic grants. The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which oversees the regional universities and community colleges, will lose $140 million in emergency federal pandemic aid after this fiscal year that has been supporting operating expenses. Similarly, UConn will lose about $130 million.
House Republicans capped growth in traditional state funds for higher education at a little more than 14% over current spending, which would send almost $117 million extra to public colleges and universities over the next two years combined. That doesn’t cover the expiring federal pandemic aid.
But Republicans note that the CSCU system and UConn are well positioned to deal with that loss.
The Connecticut Mirror reported in late March that the CSCU system entered this fiscal year with $611 million in reserve, equal to more than 50% of annual operating expenses. UConn’s main branch in Storrs held a $171 million cushion equal to 10.2% while the health center had $297 million or 18%.
Trimming electric bills and aiming for tax cuts
House Republicans hope to save the average Connecticut household $10 to $20 monthly by reducing the public benefits charge, a fee the state adds to monthly bills to finance state-mandated conservation, renewable energy, consumer assistance and other programs.
They specifically would cancel $170 million in charges used to help low-income residents pay their electric bills but maintain the program by adding the expense to the state budget. 
Another $80 million in charges that supports electric vehicle charging stations would be taken off consumers’ bills and maintained instead using state borrowing.
Relief from high energy bills “is still one of the top things we are hearing about from constituents,” said Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee.
House Republicans didn’t propose any specific tax cut but instead offered a menu of 13 different tax and fee reductions.
The caucus believes Connecticut could gain $320 million in annual revenue by challenging the remote workers tax rule that New York and certain other neighboring states follow. These states effectively hold that Connecticut residents who work from home for out-of-state employers first must pay income taxes to the state in which their employer is based.
If Connecticut is successful, that $320 million could finance relief for local households and businesses in many ways, the House GOP says.
Some of the options include new income tax deductions for households with children; exempting all Social Security earnings from state taxation; boosting the income tax credit that offsets a portion of local property tax bills by $50; canceling the 1% sales tax surcharge on prepared meals; allowing a longstanding surcharge on corporation taxes to expire; and repealing the highway mileage tax on large commercial vehicles.
“This budget is a step toward what residents deserve — affordability, accountability and flexibility in the face of uncertain federal funding,” said Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, ranking House Republican on the tax-writing Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
Boosting Medicaid rates and cutting care for undocumented residents
The House GOP budget would spend almost $38 million next fiscal year and $100 million in 2026-27 to raise Medicaid rates for doctors who treat poor patients.
The last broad-based rate adjustment plan took effect in early 2008, and critics say many children and adults enrolled in Connecticut’s HUSKY program effectively are uninsured, unable to find doctors willing to accept more Medicaid patients.
Leaders of the legislature’s Human Services Committee say Connecticut needs to be spending $300 million more on rates by 2028-29 than it does now to adequately address growing needs.
The House Republicans’ plan proposes more spending than did either Lamont’s or the Appropriations Committee’s. To help pay for that, though, the GOP would eliminate Medicaid coverage for undocumented adults and children.
Nonpartisan fiscal analysts estimate Connecticut will spend $55.1 million from its Medicaid program on this population next fiscal year and $61.2 million in 2026-27.
Nuccio said hospital emergency rooms could not refuse care to undocumented residents.
No raises for state employees for two years
House Republicans would save $330 million over the next two fiscal years combined by blocking raises for all state employees — including elected state officials.
Most unionized workers have received 2.5% general wage hikes and a step increase for each of the past four fiscal years. A step increase typically adds another 2 percentage points to the value of the raise.
“The rest of Connecticut hasn’t seen those raises,” Candelora said.
Unlike municipal legislative bodies, the General Assembly can reject an arbitration award granting raises. But lawmakers haven’t done that in decades.
Further complicating this element of the House GOP budget, Lamont recently negotiated a tentative deal with state police troopers — a union that traditionally has enjoyed strong support among Republicans — that calls for a 2.5% general wage hike and a step increase next fiscal year.
Both Candelora and Nuccio have acknowledged that if raises are provided to state police, it would be difficult for the state to argue before arbiters that it could not afford similar increases for other employee groups. 
Canceling ‘Baby Bonds’ and struggling with the spending cap
House Republicans would shift $381 million into an off-budget child care trust that would not be subject to the spending cap. Both Lamont and the Democratic-controlled Appropriations Committee have proposed investing about $300 million in child care in similar fashion outside of the formal budget.
Senate Republicans are expected to resist this proposal because the investment would be funded off-budget.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, issued a statement earlier this week that, while not aimed at the House GOP budget proposal, made general comments about circumventing state budget caps.
“Even the spirit of the fiscal guardrails must not be violated,” Harding wrote in a joint statement with Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, ranking GOP senator on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee. “But under one-party Democrat rule, the guardrails are already being broken this year by the governor and legislature. Budget gimmicks are back in style. So are job-killing future tax hikes.”
The House GOP budget also would carry $384 million from this fiscal year’s projected $2.3 billion surplus into 2025-26 — another accounting move Republicans have criticized in recent years.
But, Candelora said, “I think Senate Republicans share our commitment in having a balanced budget that doesn’t violate the caps.”
Democrats also likely would strongly oppose the GOP plan because that $381 million would come from a big Democratic initiative in recent years: the “Baby Bonds” program.
The majority party launched a plan to invest an estimated $600 million across 12 years in the economic futures of children in poverty. It involves depositing $3,200 in trust for each baby covered by HUSKY, the state’s Medicaid program.
Those $3,200 deposits — expected to be made on behalf of 15,000 or more children annually — would grow over the course of their youth and early adulthood. Recipients still living in Connecticut could tap these resources between the ages of 18 and 30, to buy a home, pay for college or invest in a business.
GOP wants big savings from limited hiring
For the House Republican plan to work, the state must budget significantly less for staffing over the next two fiscal years. The GOP needs to save $178.6 million in the first year and $210 million in the second.
Nuccio said she believes the state has over-budgeted for staffing consistently in recent years. Most of the Republican savings target involves keeping positions unfilled that are currently vacant. The plan eliminates all deputy commissioner positions.
“Government has gotten kind of fat, and I think it’s time to trim,” she said.
The House GOP also wants to save $67 million over the coming biennium by asking all state agencies to absorb a 5% cut in their “other expenses” account. But the full impact of the cut is hard to determine because departments use this line item for a wide range of purposes, including studies, legal services, consulting fees and small projects.
But Nuccio also noted that while Lamont and Democratic legislators left big holes in their respective plans involving retiree health care for state employees, her caucus does not.
State Comptroller Sean Scanlon recommended that officials budget another $228 million over the next budget cycle to cover this contractual obligation. The comptroller made a similar recommendation to the Lamont administration in December, but the governor didn’t add the money into his February budget plan. Nor did the Appropriations Committee in its last week.
Both the governor and the committee are hoping Scanlon can negotiate savings with the state’s health insurance carrier to at least mitigate this gap.
Nuccio said she also would welcome any savings but said legislators cannot budget based on wishful thinking when it comes to its legal obligations.

(Submitted)TOPEKA — The Trump administration defunded 16 of 17 Feed the Future labs across the country when it began wiping out U.S. Agency for International Development projects.
After months in limbo, Kansas State University found out its lab is the lone survivor.
Two K-State labs that are part of the Feed the Future network received stop work orders in January. In early April, K-State officials received notice that the Climate Resilient Cereals Innovation Lab could resume work, said Timothy J. Dalton, professor of agricultural economics and interim director of the lab.
The second lab, the Feed the Future Collaborative Research on Sustainable Intensification  Innovation Lab, which had a $50 million cooperative agreement for its operations, was terminated.
Dalton is unsure what the future funding will be for the Cereals lab. The original cooperative agreement allocated $22 million for five years.
“We are just completing our second year,” he said. “We receive our funding in annual increments. We’ll see what happens once this fiscal year ends.”
Dalton is pleased to continue the work the Cereals lab began, which involves collaborations with universities around the country, and with national agricultural research systems in Senegal, Ethiopia and Bangladesh.
But he’s concerned about the long-term impacts of ending 16 labs, each of which was doing work that affects farmers in the United States.
University spokeswoman Michelle Geering said U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran was helpful in getting the funding reinstated.
“K-State’s innovation lab is helping bolster American agriculture by creating crops that are resistant to drought and disease,” Moran said in a press release. “I appreciate (U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio) for recognizing the importance of the work being done at Kansas State University and supporting the continuation of this program.”
 
 International and local impacts

The research work at all the labs has implications internationally as well as for U.S. agriculture. Giving credit to another professor, Dalton borrowed an analogy to describe what the 17 Feed the Future labs were designed to do.
  Timothy Dalton, Kansas State University interim head of the Climate Resilient Cereals Innovation Lab, is worried about elimination of agriculture research because of USAID cuts. (Submitted)
“We train our military to go and fight battles overseas in order to prevent similar problems from occurring in the United States,” Dalton said. “It’s a similar argument. What we’re doing with the Innovation lab mechanism is working on very similar problems that just happen to be food-related.”
Dalton said aligning with other countries to solve agriculture challenges like crop disease resistance pays off for the United States by preparing U.S. farmers for when those same issues come here, which they eventually do, he said. 
For example, research in the 1980s to protect farms in southern Africa from the sugarcane aphid helped U.S. farmers with managing the greenbug aphid, Dalton said.
“I have always expressed my deepest concern about the halting of any international collaborative work, that it’s really going to fall on the shoulders of farmers because they’re the ones who are not getting the type of research to get out in front of these challenges that they will face,” Dalton said.
 
Longterm research
Dalton also raised concerns that halting support for the other 16 labs sets agricultural research back because of the long-term, slow path that research sometimes takes.
Researchers are usually tied to the crop cycles, so they may only be able to do investigations in the fields during certain times.
“The work in Ethiopia has had tremendous impacts, but it started half a century ago,” he said. “Because ag research moves slowly and it’s all about persistence over time, rather than stop-and-go funding, you have to think about protecting the long-run interests.”
Cereals research
Work will now continue in the Climate Resilient Cereals Lab, where they focus on researching four cereal grains: sorghum, millet, wheat and rice. 
In Senegal, research is focused on wheat and sorghum. It’s on the border of the Sahara Desert, Dalton said, where it’s always hot and dry, allowing them to study wheat that is exposed to heat and drought. Those are two issues that regularly affect Kansas farmers.  
Work studying rice in Bangladesh considers, among other things, the genes that rice varieties harbor that are resistant to disease. Identifying ways to fight rice blast, a fungal infection that destroys rice crops around the world, is part of that research.
Dalton said sorghum research is important because there are fewer researchers focused on it than on other grains. More than 50% of U.S. sorghum is grown in Kansas.
“There are so many more questions left to be answered about sorghum because it hasn’t had that intense level of research,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG-20221219-WA0009.jpg,,,2025-05-01 12:21:11.755327

(Provided by the S.C. Governor's Office)COLUMBIA — The state Senate confirmed the governor’s choice for the first director of the state’s newly formed environmental agency Wednesday.
Myra Reece has been interim director of the 1,000-employee Department of Environmental Services since its formation last year, when legislators split the department overseeing public health and environmental regulations into two.
With the Senate’s vote of 29-9 to confirm her, she will take over leadership of the agency permanently. All “no” votes came from Republicans.
“There is no one more qualified or better positioned to continue leading the Department of Environmental Services forward and into the future than Myra Reece,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement.
Reece’s confirmation faced pushback from some legislators over what Sen. Wes Climer described as a “relatively dim view of private property rights.”
Climer, R-Rock Hill, repeated criticisms leveled against her by activist Rom Reddy, who has opposed Reece’s nomination since the environmental agency fined him for a seawall he built on his oceanfront property on the Isle of Palms.
SC governor taps interim director to lead environmental agency

While other senators praised Reece during her confirmation hearings for helping constituents solve problems that had otherwise hit a wall, Climer said the need for legislators to get involved at all showed problems in the department.
“Those are evidences of a breakdown of the execution of the agency,” Climer said. “That is evidence of failure in a lot of cases.”
Reece previously spent nine years as director of environmental affairs for the combined Department of Health and Environmental Control. Before that, she was chief of the department’s air quality bureau and a regional office division director.
Her annual salary is $179,925.
“As a born and raised South Carolinian, I couldn’t be prouder to assume this critical public service position that helps safeguard our irreplaceable natural environment while supporting our state’s unprecedented economic growth,” Reece said in a statement Thursday.

Kim Reynolds announced that she would not seek reelection in 2026.  While her poll numbers have been dropping, most political observers would still wager that her odds of winning another term were much better than ever.
Nonetheless, allowing for a change of mind, it might be appropriate to reflect on the governor’s tenure to date and what I think is a lasting impact on Iowa. To state it succinctly, if the Iowa government and the state itself isn’t the epitome of Trump-Land, we certainly rank in the top 10.
We can write this as we watch the early steps taken by President Donald J. Trump, as he and his supporters take control of the federal government. The president wants to initiate a voucher program for public education. Iowa already has one. He wants to drastically reduce employment at a host of federal departments and agencies. In her reorganization of the state government, the governor transferred the administration of Medicaid program to the private sector.
Trump seeks to revoke labor union negotiated employment contracts. Reynolds requires all unions to recertify by annual election their right to represent their workers. A common trait of hostility to regulation of environmental issues dominates the thinking of both leaders. The similarity between the Trump government and Iowa is almost identical, particularly when we add in the attempt to ban a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions, restrictions on voting rights, and an extremely pro-business approach to governing.
Aside from the difference generated by the dichotomy between strictly state and strictly federal issues, it is hard to see a difference between the two. Except one: The governor of Iowa has accomplished almost all of it; the president of the United States is trying to do the same, but he can’t even talk about it.
The one the president cannot yet obtain is eliminating income tax as a source of government revenue. Reynolds has now cut the Iowa tax down to 3.8% of taxable income. It is a flat-rate tax, not like before when the tax rate was progressive.
What so many national pundits have ignored in pontificating about the president’s proposal is the real reason he pursues it. Given the trade disparity, foreign nations are the ones that should be complaining. Nor is this to rebuild America’s factory and manufacturing base. It is that the tariff revenue will serve as replacement money when he and Congress renew the tax cuts. It will also justify the repeal of all federal income taxes in the future.
The president and the Heritage Foundation are in love with the Gilded Age, the period between roughly 1880 and 1910.  It was the period of the super-rich, the Rockefellers, J.P. Morgan, and a host of others. Working conditions for the average person were harsh, with little pay, but the wealthy could not have been better off.  Some of these advocates hold that one of the darkest days of the nation was when President William Howard Taft, in 1910, introduced a constitutional amendment, the 16th, that allowed what until then was unconstitutional, a federal income tax.  The reason for the anger at Taft was at that time, it was tariffs that generated up to 80% of all government income. President Trump apparently wants those days back.
The president can hardly sell his tariff proposals on the real benefit of high tariffs. Peter Navarro, his primary trade adviser, has been advocating for the proposal by emphasizing how much money tariffs will bring the nation. This month, Navarro claimed it would generate $6 trillion over the next decade. Which would build hundreds of factories. His Commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, slipped momentarily when he admitted what the Project 2025 claimed, that it would indeed replace the income tax. He was quickly shut down.
For it or against it, Trump has a hard sell. One half of his political base, the members of commerce, live more quarterly on profit and loss and cannot tolerate the whiplash the president seems to be inflicting daily upon the markets. The other half, your average income earner, is more concerned about what increases in the market value of goods and services will be imposed upon them.
Bottom line:  If you really want to live in Trump-Land and you are here, stay here. If you are not here and want to be here, then simply stand still, click your heels three times, close your eyes, and say, “There is no place like Trump-Land.” You will open them and find yourself in our State Capitol, right outside the governor’s door.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1040-forms-taxes-IRS-_-Getty-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 12:21:11.755327

We can’t know for sure. But the shorthand definition of a recession is the economy shrinking for two consecutive quarters. And the U.S. Department of Commerce announced Wednesday that in the first three months of 2025, the economy shrank. 
Maybe economic stability and rising consumer sentiment will break out all over and prices won’t rise very much and the economy won’t shrink again in the second quarter and the U.S. economy will escape a recession.
And maybe Donald Trump will suddenly seem someone with a stable personality who bases decisions on evidence and facts instead of denying them.
Probably not, though.
‘Times of volatility’ and an area casino conglomerate
Nevada tends to enter recessions early and exit them late. 
The Great Recession technically occurred in late 2008 and early 2009. But the economic carnage was already hitting Nevada hard in 2007, and the hardships continued well into the next decade. 
By some measures, especially household income, Nevada’s economy still hadn’t fully recovered when it was hit by the next economic convulsion, delivered by the pandemic at the start of the current decade.
The economic upheaval from covid hit Nevada harder than any other state. Nevada still has the highest unemployment rate in the nation.
Now we have the economic fruits of Trump’s first 100 days: A wildly bizarre steaming pile of mayhem created by nothing but the crackpot obsessions of one 78-year-old man, and yet so disturbing it prompts comparisons to the Great Recession and the pandemic. Local exhibit A: Just as during those two prior economic calamities, the price of gold, which goes up when the economy goes south, is setting records.
But Barrick, Newmont, and lesser transnational corporations that mine Nevada’s gold and lesser minerals aren’t the only area firms that intend to weather a Trumpcession with nary a care. 
A few hours after the Department of Commerce announced the economy shrank in the first quarter of the year, MGM Resorts International heartily assured its shareholders that its first three months of 2025 were just swell.
MGM CEO Bill Hornbuckle, during an earnings call Wednesday, touted the corporation’s global geographic diversity (China!) as positioning the company’s bottom line to stand firm in “these times of volatility.”
And MGM officials also raved about the enormous success of the corporation’s massive effort to get people addicted to gambling on their phones (except MGM phrases it differently).
BetMGM, a partnership between MGM and Entain (and starring Jamie Foxx), earlier this week announced very healthy earnings for the first quarter. “What we’re seeing is really rude health,” said BetMGM CEO Adam Greengblatt, in what seems a horribly candid and apt description. After all, what could be a more fitting accompaniment to Trump’s self-inflicted economic carnage than people losing everything by gambling through an app on their phones? That is one rude product. 
And it just screams 2025.
MGM also has super high hopes for the economic performance of a separate online crack, er, gambling platform internationally, MGM Digital.
Buybacks galore
“The equity market volatility” — a polite way to say  to say Trump’s a catastrophe  — ”has provided MGM Resorts with the opportunity to repurchase shares at very attractive valuations in the first quarter,” gushed Jonathan Halkyard, MGM’s chief financial officer, in a statement accompanying Wednesday’s earnings report.
But ah, you say, the first three months of the year don’t include April 2, that historic-folkloric “Liberation Day,” and its accompanying wipeout of retirement funds. 
No worries. MGM has taken advantage of the harshly intensified “market volatility” brought on by Liberation Day to spend another $215 million on stock buybacks already in the second quarter. When you have lemons, etc.
And the corporation’s board has signed off on the company spending yet another $2 billion on buybacks.
When a corporation repurchases its own stock, it takes shares off the market, which (usually) puffs up the stock price, benefiting heavy-hitting shareholders and enriching top corporate executives who are pretty heavy stockholders themselves and whose compensation packages are almost always tied to the share price.
And the money spent to enrich shareholders (even and especially when prices are rising for consumers) is money that isn’t spent on creating new jobs or improving pay and conditions for people who have jobs now.
MGM spent $1.4 billion on buybacks in 2024, which followed a whopping $8.2 billion on buybacks between 2019 and 2023. 
The more than $700 million spent on buybacks already this year, along with the new authorization for $2 billion more, assures that MGM Resorts will continue to do what it has been doing for years: spending more on stock buybacks than Nevada’s entire gaming and mining industries pay in gaming and mining taxes combined.
Now, clearly, is no time to … or is it?
As if smashing the world’s largest economy wasn’t enough, Trump and his enablers are also attempting to curtail or kill multiple programs and services in Nevada, from parts of Medicaid to mental health care to assistance with utility bills to food banks to tribal infrastructure and so much more, while also compromising the federal government’s ability to competently and effectively carry out fundamental and crucial tasks, like administering Social Security.
Some states will be better equipped than others to protect their residents as federal assistance and funding is withdrawn. Nevada, always a notoriously cheap state when it comes to providing public programs and services, falls in the “others” category. And Trump’s economy is already forcing state lawmakers and the governor to look for places to cut the state budget.
As Nevada has shown in prior economic crises, it is incapable of saving public services and programs by itself. For a state that likes to think it sports a libertarian streak, Nevada sure does rely on the federal government a lot.
Yes, it’s possible things won’t be that bad. Maybe somehow Trump, contradicting every bit of his behavior for the last, oh, 20 years, will somehow demonstrate that he is not in point of fact a scatterbrain madman whose chief talent is crowd conning. Maybe industries will decide its safe to invest in the U.S. Maybe prices won’t skyrocket. Maybe the economy will stop shrinking and start growing, and everything will be fine.
Meanwhile, in the timeline we actually live in, the opposite of all that is more likely.
The rosy scenario presented to shareholders by Nevada’s most powerful corporation notwithstanding, all signs indicate Nevada is taking another economic nosedive, and state and local governments aren’t going to be able to fill the void in basic public services left by Trump’s hissy fits masquerading as policy proposals. Nevada, and Nevadans, are going to need some help.
Nevada’s most widely known motto is “battle born.” 
But a far more trenchant if slightly lesser known Nevada motto is “Now, clearly, is no time to raise the gaming tax.”

During debate on a bill allowing the merger of two state agencies, a debate broke out over whether the legislation should include repeal of the 1986 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Act, a package of regulations passed amid the heated controversy over locating a waste repository in Boyd County.
That controversy divided families and towns in the rural county, spawned a hunger strike by a leading opponent of the waste dump and eventually led to a judge’s ruling that Nebraska must pay $145.6 million in damages for rejecting the repository, designed to dispose of radioactive waste from five central U.S. states.
The radioactive waste controversy also played a role in the 1990 gubernatorial race. Democrat Ben Nelson, who opposed the waste facility, narrowly defeated then-Gov. Kay Orr, a Republican who backed the project.
Lawmakers approve agency merger of Nebraska’s Natural Resources into Environment and Energy

‘This is a good thing?’ 
Two state senators, Tanya Storer of Whitman and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, questioned the need to repeal the waste storage regulations during floor debate on April 22, and asked why it was included in a then-446-page proposal for a merger of the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy with the Department of Natural Resources.
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, who introduced Legislative Bill 317 on behalf of Gov. Jim Pillen, said attorneys with the NDEE advised him that the language was “obsolete,” and if the regulations were removed, there would be no way for a new low-level radioactive waste depository to be located in the state.
Storer, whose district includes Boyd County, said that any legislation that impacts the old controversy was of great interest to her constituents.
“Removing it is helping protect Nebraska? Ultimately, this is a good thing?” she asked Brandt, who responded yes.
More time to review
Despite that, Conrad won adoption of an amendment, on a 34-8 vote, that would retain the low-level radioactive waste regulations in state law.










I just felt it was too rushed and too risky. 


– State Sen. Danielle Conrad on removing old regulations for radioactive waste depositories


Conrad said that her amendment would give lawmakers more time to better understand if removing the regulations was a good thing.
“I just felt it was too rushed and too risky” to remove the rules, the senator said later.
The overriding bill, LB 317, ended up advancing to the final round debate. It passed this week 34-12. Storer and Conrad still opposed it.
The merger had been promoted by the governor as a way to increase collaboration between the departments that deal with water quantity, water quality, solid waste and manufacturing emissions, and a way to eventually save some money.
Critics said that a fiscal impact statement doesn’t show any specific cost savings and that the merger was unnecessary and had been opposed by agricultural groups.

The policy was enacted in […]","Razor wire and fencing surround the Orleans Parish Justice Center jail. (Richard A. Webster/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – An attorney for Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson cast state Attorney General Liz Murrill’s attempt to repeal the Sheriff’s Office’s longstanding immigration policy as baseless during a federal court hearing Wednesday, saying that the state has not offered any proof that Hutson’s deputies are violating state law.
The policy was enacted in 2013 following a court settlement in a 2011 civil rights case filed against the sheriff’s office. It places strict limitations on honoring detainer requests from federal immigrant authorities and prohibits deputies from initiating immigration-status investigations.
Murrill, who derisively refers to the directive as a “sanctuary” policy, has said she believes that the sheriff’s office is running afoul of a recently enacted state law that requires local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration officials. She has asked a federal judge to allow the state to join the case as a named party.
Speaking before federal Magistrate Judge Janis van Meerveld, Hutson’s chief of staff John Williams — who is acting as the agency’s attorney in Wednesday’s hearing — said the state has not shown that Orleans Parish deputies have hindered any ICE investigation since the law went into effect in May 2024.
“Above all, the sheriff is a law enforcement officer — she is one of the chief law enforcement officers of Orleans Parish,” Williams said. “She will continue to protect and enforce the laws of Louisiana.”
“There’ve been no direct communications [with ICE] where we were not collaborating or partnering in ways that were appropriate,” he said.
Murrill’s move to dissolve the policy is part of a broader conservative push — in Louisiana and across the country — to eliminate so-called “sanctuary cities,” places where local law enforcement is restricted, to one degree or another, from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling on the federal government to publish a list of localities that “obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws.”
And last week, the U.S. Department of Justice, which had never formally objected to the policy in the 12 years it’s been on the books, filed a “statement of interest” in support of Murrill’s intervention and the dissolution of the Sheriff’s Office’s policy.
It wasn’t immediately clear whether Hutson’s office has refused any ICE requests since the law took effect. Reached for comment after the hearing, Williams said he is “not personally aware” of the Sheriff’s Office refusing to honor an immigration detainer from ICE.
But after the hearing, Brian Acuna, deputy director of ICE’s regional office in New Orleans, said the Sheriff’s Office has long ignored  immigration detainer requests, and has continued to do so even after the state law took effect.
“That [OPSO] policy has an effect of allowing criminal aliens back onto the street,” Acuna said in a phone interview. “That is a huge public safety issue.”
‘This is all premature’
The current policy stems from a suit filed by two construction workers — Mario Cacho and  Antonio Ocampo, who were picked up in New Orleans on minor charges in 2009 and 2010. At the request of ICE, which was investigating their immigration statuses, the two were illegally held in the city’s jail for months beyond their short jail sentences. Under the law, such requests only allow local jails to hold people for 48 hours after they were scheduled to be released.
The pair sued in 2011. Two and a half years later, then-Sheriff Marlin Gusman agreed to a settlement, or consent decree.
As part of the agreement, Gusman adopted the current policy, which bans the Sheriff’s Office from honoring ICE detainer requests without a court order — except for inmates charged with a short list of especially serious crimes —  and bans sheriff’s deputies from initiating immigration investigations or offering ICE information about inmates’ release dates or address.
The existence of the policy itself appears to go against the new state law, which bars any law enforcement policy that places limits on honoring ICE hold requests or providing information to ICE. But in court on Wednesday, Williams told van Meerveld that the Sheriff’s Office is reviewing the policy and may suggest revisions.
On Wednesday, attorneys for Cacho and Ocampo urged van Meerveld to remember the reason for the consent decree in the first place.
“Our clients were overdetained without due process for months on end,” Matt Vogel, supervising attorney at the National Immigration Project, said in court. “This case was about justice for them and about making sure that that doesn’t happen again.”
Zachary Faircloth, principal deputy solicitor for the state, argued on Wednesday that the recent change to state law should have dissolved the OPSO policy based on the language in the 2013 consent judgement, which says the provisions in the order have “permanent effect, absent a change in federal or state law applicable to immigration detainers.”
“The consent decree turns on whether or not there was a change in state or federal law,” Faircloth said in court.
But Vogel, like the Sheriff’s Office, argued that until Murrill can prove that OPSO has violated state law, it’s too early for the judge to reconsider the policy.
“This is all premature. It’s all speculative,” Vogel said.

Legislative Bill 317, from State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, passed 34-12 without debate. This July 1, the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources will be folded into the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy, creating the Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment.   
Gov. Jim Pillen is expected to sign the bill, which Brandt introduced on his behalf. The governor has also created a “Water Quality and Quantity Task Force.” 
A revised fiscal analysis said the merger, which was expected to initially cost the state for rebranding rather than cost savings, could be absorbed. The same statement said efficiency savings could be made and realized in the 2027-29 biennium. No specifics were given.

Jesse Bradley currently serves as the joint interim director of Natural Resources and Environment and Energy. The two agencies already co-locate in the same northwest Lincoln office building.
Natural Resources has a budget of more than $104 million, largely from cash funds ($89.5 million). Environment and Energy has a budget of nearly $99 million, split roughly in half between federal ($48.9 million) and cash funds ($43.2 million).
In addition to a new combined agency director, the state will hire a “chief water officer” who essentially takes on the role of the director of Natural Resources. While LB 317 is 511 pages, much of that is dedicated to renaming the different departments and division directors across hundreds of state statutes.
The Nebraska Association of Natural Resources Districts (representing the state’s 23 NRDs), Nebraska State Irrigation Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska chapter of the Sierra Club and Nebraska Farmers Union opposed the bill at its hearing.
Many opponents expressed concern at a February public hearing for the bill that the merger might divide rather than focus attention on water resources.
Only Pillen, Bradley, a member of the state’s budget division and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (limited to a small section of LB 317) testified in support of the bill.
Brandt said he felt good that the bill passed and that the longer he met with opponents to the bill, the more that initial concerns began to fade. He noted that during the second-round debate, he sought to address concerns from a couple of senators.
“The missions won’t change,” Brandt said of the merger. “It will just become one agency.”



History of the Nebraska Departments of Natural Resources, Environment and Energy
Current: Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy

The Nebraska Department of Environmental Control is established (1971).
The department is renamed the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (1992).
Nebraska Energy Office is folded into the Environmental Quality Department, becoming DEE (2019).
State-delegated environmental health programs from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, housed in the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, are moved over to DEE (2021).

Current: Nebraska Department of Natural Resources

The State Board of Irrigation is established (1895).
The board is renamed the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage (1911).
The name changes again to the Department of Public Works, expanded to include the Bureau of Roads and Bridges; Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage; and the Motor Vehicle Records Division (1919).
The department is renamed the Nebraska Department of Roads and Irrigation (1933).
The Nebraska Department of Water Resources is established as the prior department is divided into three separate state agencies, alongside the Department of Roads and the Department of Motor Vehicles (1957).
The Natural Resources Commission merges with the Nebraska Department of Water Resources to become the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources (2000).

Future: Nebraska Department of Energy, Water and Environment
Nebraska is the only state with separate natural resources districts, which were created in 1972 as multipurpose, locally elected management bodies. There are currently 23 NRDs statewide.
Water management in the state is largely shared by the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Environment and Energy and NRDs, with specific support from the Nebraska Department of Agriculture and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.

I started out working with individuals with autism and eventually began working with people struggling with mental health and substance use issues. Later, I supported adolescents and teenagers carrying deep trauma. Today, I work behind the scenes at a Managed Care Organization (MCO) in North Carolina. I help develop plans and connect individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD), including autism, to essential services. 
I hold an associate’s degree in psychology and a bachelor’s in social sciences, and I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in social work at NC State University. These credentials don’t just represent my education—they represent a lifetime of witnessing how our systems fail the very people they are supposed to serve. 
What I’ve seen—and what many of us working in the field see every day—is a system weighed down by red tape disguised as checks, balances, and accountability. Bureaucratic processes meant to ensure “quality” have instead become barriers. I’ve seen life-changing care delayed or denied, not because of clinical judgment but because of outdated rules, disconnected policies, and constant administrative hurdles. 
Worse, the people we serve are no longer seen as human beings — they are numbers on a spreadsheet, authorization codes in a portal, or units of service to be approved or denied. But behind every case number is a person — someone’s child, parent, or friend — who deserves compassion, dignity, and timely care. 
A glaring example of systemic failure is how county borders restrict Medicaid services. If a person on Medicaid moves from one North Carolina county to another, they may lose access to their provider simply because the new county operates under a different MCO. They haven’t left the state. They haven’t stopped needing care. But now they’re disconnected from the providers they know, forced to start over, or worse, left with no care at all. That’s not how a safety net is supposed to work. 
Let’s talk about the bigger picture: 

In 2021, more than 150 million Americans lived in areas designated as Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (KFF, 2022). 
Black and Brown communities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people in poverty experience higher rates of untreated mental health conditions, yet are less likely to receive care (SAMHSA, 2023). 
The substance use crisis continues to claim over 100,000 lives a year, yet we continue to criminalize instead of treat. 
And mental health workers? We’re exhausted. A 2022 report found that more than half of behavioral health workers are experiencing burnout and considering leaving the field, not because we don’t care, but because the system makes it impossible to provide the care, we know people need.

Many of the policies in place today were written by individuals who have no background in mental health or substance use treatment. Lawmakers and decision-makers, without training or input from frontline professionals, are drafting rules that dictate how care is delivered. It’s not just frustrating. It’s harmful. 
This isn’t just about inefficiency. It’s about injustice. We need legislation that centers people, not paperwork. We need lawmakers willing to listen to social workers, therapists, peer support specialists, families, and those with lived experience. We need policies informed by practice, not politics. 
To the public: demand better. This is your issue, too, because when systems fail one group, they eventually fail us all. Vote for those who understand or are willing to learn. Speak up when silence means complicity. 
To policymakers: If you lack experience in mental health, listen to those who do. Invite us to the table. Include our voices when you write the rules. Our communities depend on you to transform the system, not manage it. 
I am writing this letter because I believe change is still possible. But we can no longer afford to pretend the current system is working. Lives are being lost, families are being broken, and professionals are being pushed to the edge — all while the system protects itself instead of the people it was built to serve. 
We deserve better. And we demand better.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AdobeStock_mentalhealth-commitment.jpg,,,2025-05-01 11:07:43.839084
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-01 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT mayor says Hamden revaluation crisis will spread across the state,John Henry Smith | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/01/ct-hamden-revaluation-crisis/,Hamden homeowners are facing steep property tax increases this year following a state-mandated revaluation that has left residents scrambling.,"Hamden homeowners are facing steep property tax increases this year following a state-mandated revaluation that has left residents and Mayor Lauren Garrett scrambling to respond.
In a letter to residents in mid-April, Garrett warned that the assessed value of homes had risen by an average of 55%.
The roots of the problem, Garrett said, go back to the pandemic, when homebuyers flooded Hamden and other parts of Connecticut, often engaging in bidding wars that sent sale prices soaring well above asking.
“People are coming in with cash offers. People are coming in to offer more than the asking price. That has driven up the housing market,” Garrett said in an interview with Connecticut Public Radio. “That new price is now the market rate, and what has resulted in that are increases in property appraisals.”
While she promised to lower the town’s mill rate by 22%, from 55.61 to 43.39 to help blunt the impact, she acknowledged that many property owners would still see significant tax hikes.
Some homeowners facing double tax bills
Despite proposing a lower mill rate, Garrett described the resulting situation as an “effective tax increase” for many homeowners.
State law requires that assessments equal 70% of a property’s appraised market value. With those valuations sharply up, Garrett said some Hamden homeowners will see their taxes rise 10% to 20%. But others, particularly those whose assessments spiked by as much as 130%, could face a doubling of their property tax bills.
Meanwhile, Garrett said the town’s commercial properties haven’t kept pace with the residential market.
“Apartments are up there around a 40% increase in assessed value, but the retail isn’t quite there, and office space is flat,” she said.
That imbalance, she said, is shifting more of the tax burden onto homeowners and compounding their financial strain.
The mayor acknowledged that some Hamden residents could lose their homes.
“There are people who are on fixed income, and they are going to have a very difficult time affording this new reality,” Garrett said.
Frustration boils over at town council meeting
Adding to the tension, a Hamden Town Council meeting on April 24 turned heated, with one resident suggesting Garrett should be wearing a bulletproof vest. Residents voiced anger and fear over the tax hikes, criticizing town leadership for not doing more to shield them from the fallout.
“People are justifiably angry and scared,” Garrett said. “We’re going into what will probably be a recession, making things even more challenging.”
The tax increases will come despite an effective 12.22 reduction in the town’s mill rate in the newest proposed budget. At the meeting, some residents criticized the mayor for not doing more. She said the fact that this comes at a time when tax revenues from commercial real estate seem poised to stagnate or fall has made this a difficult event to plan for.
“We knew that property values had gone up,” she said. “I think that where it wasn’t quite so obvious was on the commercial side — that they weren’t going up nearly as much.”
Mayor eyes long-term solutions
Looking ahead, Garrett said her administration’s goal is to lay the groundwork for a better outcome five years from now, when the next revaluation is scheduled.
“I want to make sure that we have increased our supply [of housing] to bring down some of the housing costs,” Garrett said. “I want to make sure that we are increasing our ability to have commercial properties improve their properties for highest and best use.”
She said achieving that will depend on investments in infrastructure and aggressively pursuing grants to help drive economic development.
Warning signs for other Connecticut towns
Garrett said she’s been in touch with officials in West Haven, North Haven, and Wallingford — towns that are also seeing steep tax hikes driven by revaluation.
She believes Hamden won’t be the last Connecticut town plagued by this revaluation problem.
“I think this is going to be happening throughout Connecticut,” she said.

Delaware’s annual open burning ban goes into effect today, May 1, and will remain in place through September 30, as part of the state’s ongoing efforts to improve air quality during the high-risk ozone season.
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) reminds residents and visitors that most forms of outdoor burning are prohibited during this time.
The seasonal ban aims to reduce the formation of ground-level ozone, a pollutant that becomes more prevalent with warmer temperatures and longer daylight hours.
READ: First State Military Academy to celebrate 10 years with community day event
“The burning ban is critical for continuing to improve our air quality,” said Environmental Scientist Gerald Mood of the DNREC Division of Air Quality. “As summer temperatures rise, and as we get longer daylight hours, the conditions which allow for the formation of ground level ozone become more prevalent.”
Ground-level ozone forms when pollutants from sources such as smoke interact with sunlight.
In addition to causing environmental harm, ozone can pose serious health risks, especially for children, the elderly, and people with respiratory conditions.
While the ban restricts most burning, exceptions are made for small-scale activities such as cooking fires, recreational campfires, and ceremonial bonfires.
However, these too may be temporarily banned if an Air Quality Action Day is declared or if the State Fire Marshal imposes additional restrictions.
The ban covers agricultural and prescribed burns, as well as the burning of yard debris like brush and tree limbs.
It is illegal at any time of year to burn leaves, grass, trash, or other refuse materials, including tires, plastics, and construction waste.
DNREC encourages residents to use safer alternatives for disposing of yard waste, such as curbside pickup services, drop-off sites, mulching, or composting.
More information on these options is available here.
Violations of the open burning ban can be reported to DNREC’s Environmental Hotline at 1-800-662-8802.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/istockphoto-1359996785-612x612-1.jpg,,,2025-05-01 11:07:43.839084

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.

– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America


Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

Young International Airport in Detroit | Ken Coleman A bill introduced in the Michigan House of Representatives would rename a section of highway in Jackson County after a missing Tuskegee Airman who grew up in the city of Jackson.
State Rep. Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson) said that her sponsored legislation, House Bill 4145, would name a section of U.S. 127 between mile markers 39 and 40, near the I-94 interchange, after 2nd Lieutenant Roosevelt Stiger, a Tuskegee Airman and Purple Heart recipient.
“It is a real privilege to advocate on behalf of a true American hero,” said Schmaltz in a press release. “2nd Lieutenant Stiger served our country with courage, broke barriers, and gave his life fighting for freedom. This memorial is a small but meaningful way we can ensure his legacy lives on in the community he once called home.”
Stiger was born in Mississippi in 1919 and moved to Jackson with his family during his childhood. He trained as a pilot through the Tuskegee Aviation Cadet program. Stiger graduated in 1944 and was deployed overseas with the 99th Fighter Squadron, 332nd Fighter Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.

During a bomber escort mission over the Adriatic Sea on Oct. 7, 1944, he reported issues with his oxygen system. Stiger’s aircraft was seen descending toward the water and he was never recovered, remaining listed as missing in action.
The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African American military aviators in the U.S. Armed Forces, breaking racial barriers during a time of segregation and limited opportunity. Despite facing systemic racism, these men trained rigorously and flew countless successful missions during World War II. 
About 1,000 pilots were trained as Tuskegee Airmen, along with thousands of support personnel. Notable members include Coleman A. Young, who later became the first Black mayor of Detroit, and Charles McGee, a decorated fighter pilot who served in three wars. 
The Tuskegee Airmen National Museum, which honors their legacy, is located in Detroit at the historic Coleman A. Young International Airport. The bill was approved by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and now goes to the full House for consideration.

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Former Kansas foster care leaders accused of defrauding their old employer of millions of dollars indicated in court that they plan to change their not guilty pleas, avoiding a trial.
William Whymark, the former IT director for the regional foster care provider Saint Francis Ministries is expected to change his plea later this year as attorneys continue to negotiate a deal. His co-defendant and former Saint Francis CEO Robert Smith is also “actively engaged in plea negotiations,” Smith’s attorney said at a Wednesday hearing.
Whymark and Smith face federal charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud and one count of money laundering amounting to $4.7 million in damages. A federal grand jury indicted the two in November 2022. 
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse set a May 28 hearing for Smith, whose attorney expressed concern Wednesday with some of the case’s numbers and calculations. Whymark is expected to change his plea at a Sept. 3 hearing. 
The two defendants were not present at the April 30 status conference. Whymark’s attorney said Whymark was in the emergency room the night before and is scheduled to receive additional treatment. Smith, who lives in Tennessee, waived his right to appear.

(Kinross photo)North of Fairbanks, hundreds of workers at Alaska’s biggest gold mine dig up, haul, crush and grind thousands of tons of ore each day, year-round. 
The sprawling Fort Knox mine consumes $40 million worth of power every year — more than any other business in the state, and some 16% of the power produced by Fairbanks’ electric utility.
Generating all that energy isn’t cheap. It’s also a huge source of planet-warming greenhouse gases.
Kinross, the global company that owns Fort Knox, operates five other mines, spread across the U.S., South America and Africa. Power at Fort Knox costs more and accounts for more greenhouse gas emissions than each of the company’s other operations, according to Meadow Riedel, a Kinross spokesperson.

The story is similar for Pogo, the Interior’s other major gold mine and the state’s second largest. 
In other countries, Kinross and Northern Star, the Australian company that owns Pogo, have spent millions of dollars on solar and wind power to curb carbon emissions and costs at their mines. 
In Alaska, they’ve opted for a different approach, at least for now: pushing the cooperatively owned utility that sells them electricity.
Behind the scenes, the two multinational gold mining companies have emerged as key players in the movement to get that utility, Golden Valley Electric Association, to invest more in renewable energy. 
 
Mining exec: Alaska’s pricy, fossil fuel-based power could thwart investment

	So far, their efforts have not fully succeeded: The utility has yet to commit to any large new wind or solar projects, and it continues to generate most of its electricity by burning coal and oil.
But the miners’ push underscores how multibillion-dollar resource development corporations have turned into odd bedfellows with Alaska’s climate activists — both calling for the state’s utilities to limit their contributions to global warming.
The corporations, based outside the U.S., have faced social and political pressure from shareholders and government regulators to reduce their environmental impacts. They’ve also seen the cost of solar and wind power fall due to government subsidies and technological improvements, making renewables more competitive with fossil fuels. 
New obstacles have arisen, though, as the Trump administration promotes carbon-based fuels and threatens to claw back billions of dollars of clean energy funding. 
The stakes are high not only for the mining corporations, but also for Golden Valley Electric Association’s more than 36,000 members — including many residents of Fairbanks, who pay less for electricity as a result of the utility’s massive power sales to the mines.
Renewable energy advocates say replacing fossil fuels with new wind and solar power could lower long-term costs for homes and businesses in Fairbanks and other towns in the Interior. At the same time, a looming shortage of natural gas in Cook Inlet is putting pressure on Golden Valley Electric Association, known as GVEA, to find new ways to generate power.

 Offshore oil and gas platforms in Cook Inlet, like this one, once provided a cheap source of energy to Anchorage-area electric utilities, which sold power to the Fairbanks area. But gas has become increasingly expensive to extract from the Inlet, and the utilities have stopped selling power to the Interior and are now looking to import cargoes of LNG to power their generators.

“The gas crisis and the new administration have really changed how people are approaching this,” said Eleanor Gagnon, who works on energy policy at the Fairbanks Climate Action Coalition. “I think it has the potential to push us forward toward renewables and carbon neutrality — or push us deeper into our fossil fuel track.”
So far, GVEA has taken a cautious approach, with some board members worried that moving too quickly away from conventional energy sources like coal could drive up costs. 
But if the utility doesn’t invest in new wind or solar and keeps burning large volumes of fossil fuels, Kinross and Northern Star might be compelled to build their own, independent renewables projects. 
That would have consequences across the region: Losing the utility’s two biggest customers could raise electricity costs for thousands of people in Fairbanks, according to Phil Wight, an energy historian at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who is also a GVEA member. 
“If GVEA does not commit to building out the next generation of renewables, and doing so relatively soon, the mines may go out and get alternative sources of lower-carbon power — and all GVEA ratepayers would be paying more,” Wight said.
 “This is the million dollar question,” Wight added. “Why is GVEA not moving forward with building generation that, everywhere else in the world, utilities are pursuing because it’s cheaper?” 
High costs, high emissions
To separate valuable metals from plain rock, mining companies crush and grind ore into tiny pieces — a heavy industrial process that uses loads of electricity.
That means energy is usually one of the top expenses for mining companies. If that energy comes from fossil fuels, it’s also one of companies’ largest sources of planet-heating emissions. 
That dynamic is magnified in Alaska, according to company officials.
Fort Knox’s 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in 2023 represent 20% more greenhouse gases per ounce of gold produced when compared to the company’s second highest-emitting mine, in Nevada, corporate disclosures show.

	The $40 million in yearly power consumption at Fort Knox represents a disproportionate financial expense, too. In Nevada, where the company operates two mines, electricity costs half as much, according to Riedel, the Kinross spokesperson.  
The company’s high costs and emissions in Alaska put Fort Knox at a “disadvantage” in Kinross’s internal decisions about future investments, Riedel said in an emailed statement.  
“Kinross Alaska is always competing with other Kinross sites for investment,” she said.
The company has already been working to reduce energy consumption and climate impacts in Alaska as it seeks to eliminate or fully offset carbon pollution at its mines by 2050. Fort Knox has tweaked its ore grinding process to make it more efficient and shortened haul routes to cut down on diesel use, Riedel said.
For now, Kinross isn’t developing any of its own large-scale clean energy projects in Alaska, according to Riedel. 
Building renewables at the mine “would be challenging due to Alaska’s expansive geography and extreme climate,” she said.
But Kinross might consider a “smaller scale” development, she said. She would not elaborate on how big of a project the company might build, or on what timeline, though the company spent $55 million on a solar farm at a huge mine in Mauritania.

	Northern Star, which also has a goal of fully offsetting emissions at its mines by midcentury, has indicated that it might invest in wind power at the Pogo mine, which is about 40 miles northeast of the Interior community of Delta Junction. But the company hasn’t disclosed any concrete plans to do so. 
In a corporate report published last year, Northern Star suggested that it expects to develop a project at Pogo in 2025 that would move it toward a companywide goal of lowering emissions by 35% this decade. 
A Northern Star spokesperson would not provide details about that project, which is labeled simply in the report as “Pogo GRID 16 MW.” That figure appears to refer to 16 megawatts of power that Pogo draws from the grid.
No major operating mines in Alaska are powered by private solar or wind farms. 
At the massive Red Dog zinc mine in Northwest Alaska, which runs on expensive, shipped-in diesel, Vancouver-based Teck Resources said last year that it would install a weather tower to study the potential for generating renewable power. 
But those plans fizzled, according to a company spokesperson who declined to comment further. 
Frozen funds
Last year, GVEA generated more than 80% of its power from fossil fuels — primarily coal, diesel and naphtha, which is a refined oil product. 
The rest comes from a mix of existing wind, solar and hydropower projects. 
Until last year, GVEA bought relatively inexpensive gas-fired electricity that other utilities generated in the Anchorage area. But a shortage of natural gas in Cook Inlet has severed that supply indefinitely.
Looking to diversify, GVEA announced last year that it had secured nearly $500 million in federal loans and grants that would help it vastly expand its use of renewables. 
That money would pay for two battery systems to store power from new wind and solar projects when it’s not sunny or windy. It also would cover more than 60 miles of new transmission lines, allowing the utility to tap into proposed wind farms in the Interior. 
But boosters of renewables have grown frustrated that the utility still lacks firm plans to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. And now, the federal funds for GVEA’s infrastructure upgrades are in limbo amid the Trump administration’s broad freeze on green energy spending, according to Ashley Bradish, a spokesperson for the utility.
Federal officials on March 25 gave funding recipients a month to propose project changes that align with President Donald Trump’s executive order on “unleashing American energy” and to “remove far-left climate features.” GVEA was given only 500 characters to outline those revisions, utility officials said. 
“Just within the last few weeks, GVEA’s job got a lot harder,” said Wight, the energy expert. 
GVEA’s board voted in 2022 to shut down one of its two big coal power plants — a step toward lowering emissions and moving to renewables.

	But the utility reversed course last year, citing the natural gas supply crunch and saying it would keep operating the coal plant until lower-cost alternatives became available. 
Then, in August, it signed a new contract with Usibelli Coal Mine — the state’s only supplier of the fuel — to buy more feedstock for the plant, which burns some 200,000 tons of coal each year.
While coal comes with high carbon emissions, it’s relatively cheap, and utility leaders fear that replacing it with renewables could boost costs and reduce reliability for consumers.
If Golden Valley adds more wind and solar power, it would need a way to store energy and consistently distribute it, and “there’s a cost associated with that,” Bradish said. “Our current battery can’t provide that regulation.” 
The utility has not released an analysis showing how rates would change if it were to replace fossil fuel-fired power with renewables.

	“That’s part of what we’re studying,” Bradish said.
Some advocates, like Gagnon with Fairbanks Climate Action Coalition, say there’s also a cost associated with continuing to burn fossil fuels. GVEA is paying some $14 million to build two storage tanks at the Fairbanks-area oil refinery that it buys fuel from.
“The mines’ support of renewables is evidence for the cost-effectiveness of renewables,” said Gagnon. “Their bottom line is going to be cost.” 
Kinross and Pogo — whose mines collectively account for about 30% of the utility’s energy sales — haven’t said how long they’ll wait on GVEA before building their own wind or solar farms. 
Riedel, with Kinross, said her company wants to see GVEA take steps “soon,” but she would not elaborate. 
“It is not our role to specify to GVEA as to its generation and power supply portfolio,” Riedel said. “What we need from our provider is electricity that is reliable, low cost and the least environmental impact possible. It is up to the provider to determine how to get there.” 
GVEA communicates closely with Kinross and Northern Star about their emissions reduction targets, Bradish said.
Losing them as customers “absolutely would have an impact on our membership,” she added. “It’s something that is definitely thought about when we’re moving forward.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz’s administration wants to eliminate a program that allows low-income parents to take out loans from nonprofit organizations for tutoring services, using their tax refunds as collateral.
The proposal comes after the Reformer and Sahan Journal reported on mothers losing thousands of dollars from their tax refunds to pay debts to Success Tutoring and Achievers Tutoring for instruction they say their kids barely used and didn’t benefit from.
The mothers say they were told the tutoring was free and would help their kids recover from pandemic learning loss. Instead, they were outraged to discover their tax refunds had been transferred to a nonprofit organization, which in turn paid the companies for online tutoring with overseas instructors the kids couldn’t understand.
The Reformer interviewed three instructors based in the Philippines, one of whom said she was paid less than $5 an hour to supervise mostly Somali-American students as they worked through online modules in reading and math.
The loan program was intended to help more low-income families take advantage of the K-12 Education Tax Credit, which reimburses families earning less than about $80,000 for three-quarters of their eligible educational expenses, up to $1,500 per child per year. Most eligible families can’t afford to spend thousands of dollars up front and wait to be repaid when they get their tax refund the next year.
But it also made low-income households vulnerable to losing money if they didn’t submit the correct paperwork or the tutoring services they received were later deemed ineligible by the Department of Revenue. In those cases, the tax credit wouldn’t be awarded — but the loan to the nonprofit would still be repaid directly from the Department of Revenue through the rest of their refund, including money from Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit.
Families interviewed by the Reformer tried to recover the money missing from their refunds but found themselves trapped in a Kafkaesque maze, carrying stacks of different colored papers to the nonprofit lender, Minnesota Afterschool Advance, the state Department of Revenue, the Attorney General’s Office and, finally, to the press.
“The benefits of receiving the credit early are diminished by the potential confusion for the taxpayer when it is time to file their tax return,” the Walz administration wrote in its budget proposal.
The Walz administration also noted that less than 1% of eligible taxpayers who claimed the credit used a lender to advance them the funds, making it harder to justify the resources needed to oversee financial compliance and preapprove tutoring providers.
That tax credit won’t go away under the governor’s proposal, but nonprofits and financial institutions will no longer be able to loan families money for tutoring, computers and books to be repaid by their tax refunds.
Both Democrats and Republicans have introduced a slew of proposals aimed at clamping down on a crisis of fraud in state government, with hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly siphoned away from programs supposed to fund child nutrition, autism services, transportation and interpretation assistance.
Minnesota Afterschool Advance, the organization that loaned the families money to pay for tutoring, said it’s not issuing new loans in 2025 as they are “focused on systems change.”
“MAA is aware of the governor’s proposal. While we are not opposing it, MAA remains committed to working with government stakeholders to improve access to the Minnesota K-12 Education Tax Credit,” spokeswoman Lynne Matthews wrote in an email to the Reformer.
Minnesota Afterschool Advance, which is a collaboration between Youthprise and Venn Foundation, was founded by Rep. Matt Norris, DFL-Blaine. Norris helped grow the program to $1.8 million in funding for educational programs in 2022, according to his campaign website.
Norris, who left Minnesota Afterschool Advance when he entered the Legislature in 2023, said last year he was unaware of the mothers’ complaints — and debt.
Norris declined to comment on the governor’s proposal through a spokesperson.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250425_0411-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 09:08:33.796125

Let’s dive into some immigration news:

Proposed detention center?: As President Donald Trump and his administration continue to crack down on immigration, the federal government is eyeing opportunities to dramatically expand the number of immigration detention centers. Federal officials in April started eyeing Fairfield’s Travis Air Force Base as a possible site, according to KQED. The base is one of at least 10 other military bases in the U.S. under consideration. A month earlier, demonstrators rallied at the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin after internal emails revealed that the Trump administration was considering the now-shuttered prison for women as another possible detention facility.


A lack of proper care: The California Department of Justice released a 165-page report Tuesday detailing the conditions of the state’s six, privately-operated active immigration facilities, writes CalMatters’ Wendy Fry. State investigators found that the sites had “deficiencies in suicide prevention and intervention strategies,” staffing shortages and a lack of coordination between medical and mental health care providers. The conditions, such as solitary confinement, can exacerbate mental health issues that many detainees already have, including anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The report also found that more than 3,100 people were held in immigration detention centers as of April 16 — up from the daily average of about 1,750 in 2021. About 75% of those detained had no documented criminal history. Read more here.


Temporary order on Border Patrol: Wendy and CalMatters’ Sergio Olmos also report that a California judge has temporarily barred Border Patrol agents from making immigration stops unless they have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the U.S. illegally. The injunction also prohibits agents from carrying out warrantless arrests unless they have probable cause that the person is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. The order stems from a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the United Farm Workers, after Border Patrol agents in January conducted a three-day sweep in Kern County. A CalMatters investigation revealed that agents had no criminal or immigration history on 77 of the 78 people it arrested from the sweep. Read more here.

A ‘reading wars’ compromise

On Wednesday state lawmakers reworked a bill that now seeks to provide funding for phonics-based instruction in K-12 classrooms without requiring schools or teachers to implement it.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, the measure’s new language signals a compromise between two camps of educators who argue that reading programs should either emphasize phonics, or the sounding-out of words; or sight reading, which focuses on memorizing words by sight.
The measure would require the state to provide training for teachers and instructional materials on the phonics reading approach. Because English learner advocates have criticized the phonics method for being too confusing for students who are not English proficient, the bill also requires materials and training to address the specific needs of English learners. (About 18% of California’s K-12 students, or 5.8 million, are English learners.)
The bill replaces another proposal, which died last week, that would have required schools to use the phonics-based approach.

Two chairpersons get ‘rolled’

A Senate bill that would boost housing development near public transportation hubs has advanced through two Senate committees — despite strong objections from both leaders of the committees, writes CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.
The rather unusual development could indicate a “philosophical split” among Democrats related to the state’s approach to building more housing, said longtime California lobbyist Chris Micheli. 
In one corner are the Democrats, including bill author Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, who want housing to be easier, quicker and cheaper to build. In the other are Democrats who do not oppose more housing, but are concerned with issues related to private development, regulation and affordability. This group includes the two chairpersons of the Senate’s housing and local government committees, Sens. Aisha Wahab of Fremont and María Elena Durazo of Los Angeles, respectively.
Wiener, however, disagrees that there may be a deep rift within the party when it comes to housing.

Wiener: “You have two chairs who have just a different perspective and that’s normal and, you know, I appreciate that we’ve been able to go through this process very respectfully. We’re all grown ups.”

Extreme temperatures pose a health risk on both ends of the spectrum as increasingly hot days can contribute to heat stroke and worsening seasonal allergies, while the bitter cold can aggravate respiratory health issues and cause hypothermia.
The post How higher temperatures and more pollen are affecting the health of Boston residents appeared first on Comm[...]","IN HER 20 YEARS of practicing medicine in Boston, Dr. Robyn Riseberg has seen symptoms of illnesses like asthma and seasonal allergies worsening, and she’s observed personally how the flu and RSV seasons seem to be getting longer. As a pediatrician and founder of Boston Community Pediatrics, Riseberg has seen patients through countless cold New England winters and hot summers, the Covid-19 pandemic, and various strains of common illnesses. “We’ve definitely seen an increase in respiratory infections,” Riseberg said. “The different flu strains have changed over the course of the last 20 years as well. And so we’ve had some seasons which have been much worse than others.” Experts say climate change exacerbates these trends. Extreme temperatures pose a health risk on both ends of the spectrum as increasingly hot days can contribute to heat stroke and worsening seasonal allergies, while the bitter cold can aggravate respiratory health issues and cause hypothermia. They also affect water and air quality, the latter of which can be negatively impacted by high temperature, airborne allergens and carbon emissions. As climate change intensifies, different communities will see different effects. “The impacts are highly localized,” says Greg Wellenius, director of Boston University’s Center for Health and Climate. Heat is the leading weather-related cause of death in the United States, and Boston, along with much of New England, had not been built to withstand it.  Since 1982, the Earth has been warming three times as fast per decade as it did between 1850 and the early 80s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Massachusetts has seen temperatures increase by almost 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Even with efforts to reduce emissions, Boston will see the average number of days over 90 degrees rise from 10 days to 46 per year by the 2070s, city planners expect. Buildings and infrastructure were designed with the traditional New England climate in mind – very cold winters and moderate summers, but both are becoming more extreme. Most of Boston’s buildings were built before 1950 and the popularization of central air and heating, according to a 2019 report from the city. “We build our buildings in a way that they tend to trap heat because that was a good way to reduce the energy needed in order to survive the winter,” Wellenius said. “But now those same design features keep our houses probably too warm in the summer.” In Massachusetts, there have been about 700 emergency department visits for heat stress on average per year since 2000, according to state tracking data. While heat advisory warnings ask people to stay indoors, usually in an air-conditioned space, not having that option at home can create unsafe situations, especially for children and seniors, who are the most vulnerable to extreme heat.  Riseberg said doctors “really worry” about kids because “they need to be able to regulate their temperatures.”  “Children are at sort of a higher risk of climate related health concerns because they’re not like small adults, they’re different,” she said.  In 2022, Boston released a heat resilience plan to serve as a roadmap for how the city would address climate change and extreme heat as part of the Climate Ready Boston plan, which was first created in 2016. The “Heat Resilience Solutions for Boston” plan lays out a number of ways the city will try to tackle extreme heat, including by providing full-shade canopies to reduce surface level temperatures, improving public transportation for cooler commutes, enhancing the city’s green space and drinking fountain network, and planting more trees.  Chris Osgood, director of Boston’s Office of Climate Resilience, said that in addition to the plans outlined in Climate Ready Boston, the city has “expanded their toolkit” to address heat emergencies by having more shade structures at community centers and libraries.  “Last year, we installed a series of misting tents, misting coolers, and misting towers, ways that residents in the city can sort of cool off,” he said. The city’s heat website “posts all the cooling centers, places open to members of the public who may need a place to be able to keep cool during the hottest parts of the day.” Another way to address the heat and keep cities cooler is by planting more trees. Massachusetts’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has identified the loss of the urban tree cover as a climate concern for the Boston Harbor area. The city has planted more than 4,000 trees over the past few years and is partnering with local organizations to provide grants to property owners to expand the tree canopy in their yards. “We are particularly focused on those areas of our city that are urban heat islands,” Osgood said. “The mayor has significantly expanded our work around tree and canopy cover.” As winter is getting shorter and summer is getting hotter, springtime is bringing worsening respiratory issues and air quality. A 2023 study published in eBioMedicine, a division of The Lancet, showed a connection between global warming, longer growing seasons, and more potent pollen. “That’s driven by changes in the average wintertime temperature and essentially, the number of months during which vegetation, primarily trees and grasses, are able to grow enough to generate the pollen,” Wellenius said.  Because of this, symptoms of seasonal and respiratory allergies, such as itchy eyes, asthma, and nasal congestion are getting worse, leading to more allergy-induced asthma attacks that result in hospitalizations.  Riseberg said she has started seeing patients earlier in the season about their seasonal allergies compared to the beginning of her career.  “It seems like the majority of them are getting worse,” she said. “All of the symptoms that we are used to seeing just seem to be a little bit more pronounced.”  Riseberg said the causes of asthma attacks can be “multifactorial” and are not only due to air quality. Poor housing conditions, mold exposure, air pollution, and even mice droppings can be contributing factors in asthma attacks.  In addition to fostering an increased pollen count, rising temperatures make it easier for air pollutants like ozone, which increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, to become trapped in the lower atmosphere. “We’ve made dramatic improvements as a country in reducing the levels of most air pollutants,” Wellenius said. “Recent gains are threatened because our average temperature increase creates conditions that are more favorable to pollutants.”  Air quality can vary between Boston neighborhoods. East Boston, for example, where Logan International Airport is and where 1-90 and I-93 intersect is a particular concern. “[They] breathe in the tailpipe emissions from airplanes every single day,” said Hessann Farqooi, executive director of the Boston Climate Action Network, a grassroots climate justice movement.  The Climate Ready Boston plan considers East Boston as a focus neighborhood for dealing with rising temperatures and excess heat, but it does not state how it will address air quality issues in the neighborhood.  “Climate change affects everyone, but not everyone is starting in the same place,” Farqooi said.  “The people who are hit first and worst by the effects of climate change are very often the people who have the least social, political, and economic power.” The post How higher temperatures and more pollen are affecting the health of Boston residents appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Transportation_Logan-Airport_Plane_Sunset-edited.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 09:08:33.796125

Here’s what happened next.","In summary
After reading a CalMatters article, two people were able to reconnect with their homeless relatives. Here’s what happened next. 


The last time Julie Crossman saw her little sister, Nanie Crossman, it was 2019 and Nanie was moving out of Julie’s San Francisco apartment, destination unknown. 
For the next six years, Julie worried — especially every time it rained. She assumed Nanie was homeless, but she had no idea where she was or how to find her. 
“I just couldn’t sleep at night because I was so scared,” Jule said, her voice breaking. “I was really scared that she was just, like, cold and alone.”
Then, in January, Julie got a text from her half-brother. It was a link to a CalMatters article about unhoused people voting. And it quoted Nanie.
That article launched Julie on a quest to find her long-lost sister, rekindle their relationship and — maybe — help her get off the street.
It’s estimated more than 187,000 Californians are homeless. But no one counts the number of people like Julie, who stay up late worrying, compulsively Googling their sister, father or child’s name for a clue to their whereabouts. The people who scan every face each time they pass a homeless encampment.
Their numbers are likely far greater. 
Some nonprofits that work in the homeless services sector say reconnecting with family is a crucial, and often overlooked, step in getting clients off the street. Even if a family member can’t offer up their guest room or couch, they might help their loved one find housing, access addiction treatment, sign up for benefits, or simply provide emotional support — reminding them that they are important and worthy of love. But the process of finding and reconnecting with someone living outside can be difficult, both logistically and emotionally, for everyone involved. 
Once the person is found, it opens up a new question: What, if anything, can be done to help? The answer is almost never simple. Despite a growing effort by homeless service providers to reunite clients with their families, there’s little data to show how often those reunifications end someone’s homelessness.  
And, as Julie found when she searched for guidance, few resources exist to help families navigate this terrain. 
“I haven’t found anything,” Julie said. “It’s frustrating because this whole thing is happenstance and coincidence and lucky breaks but there’s not really a road map that I can find of other people’s methods, or things they’ve done that have been helpful.”
Two sisters reunite
From the CalMatters article, Julie gleaned one important fact: Nanie was living in an RV parked on a West Oakland street. It felt like a lucky break – Julie had since moved to Oakland as well. She emailed the CalMatters reporter to find out more. 
Three weeks later, on a sunny Tuesday morning, she and the reporter stood outside a row of RVs on a trash-strewn side street next to a graffiti-covered warehouse wall. It had taken a few tries to get there. Police had forced Nanie to move from her prior parking spot a week and a half earlier, so Julie and the reporter walked up and down the nearby streets, asking other RV-dwellers if they knew her. 
Eventually, they found an RV that had Nanie’s name sketched near the door. Julie was scared. She worried Nanie wouldn’t want to talk to her after all these years.
They knocked — no answer. Nanie wasn’t in her RV. But they soon found her in the RV next door.
“Julie!” Nanie exclaimed, stepping outside. The sisters threw their arms around each other in a tight hug.
“What’s up, dude?” Nanie asked when they separated, as if it hadn’t been six years.
“Nothing is up,” Julie replied, beaming. The resemblance between the two sisters, now both in their 40s, was obvious: Matching dark hair, pale complexions and smiles.

Julie and Nanie immediately launched into a remarkably ordinary conversation, updating each other on their lives. They discovered they both have cats. Neither has a driver’s license. Nanie described what it was like being homeless in San Francisco during the COVID-19 pandemic (she liked having the streets to herself) and talked about the time she spent living in Sacramento. Julie wanted to know about the logistical details of her sister’s life: How do you get clothes? What about food?
They kept it light. They didn’t unpack old traumas or air past grievances. Julie didn’t ask Nanie if she was using drugs or badger her about getting a job and moving inside.
Later, Julie said it took some willpower to tamp down her protective, older-sister instincts. 
“I don’t want to judge her life where it’s just a fact of life. I just don’t think that’s a good way to approach it,” Julie said. “If it were me, I would just shut down. I would not want to talk to someone like that, who was asking me that kind of question.”
Julie presented Nanie with the offerings she brought: A few cans of sparkling water, wet wipes, socks and a fancy pen. She offered to do Nanie’s laundry.
“Nanie, I’m so glad to see you,” Julie said with a squeal, giving her sister another hug. “I feel like we’re just chit-chatting.”
‘It’s tougher than I even imagined’
Julie and Nanie were close as kids growing up in Boston’s Beacon Hill neighborhood. They invented games, such as using a Barbie boombox to record themselves reading children’s books in funny voices. As they got older, their conversations were so full of inside references that outsiders, including one of Julie’s former boyfriends, were left in the dark. 
Nanie told a CalMatters reporter that after she became homeless, she avoided trying to find Julie. She was afraid her sister would be mad at her or judgmental — or worse, that she’d died in an accident and Nanie hadn’t known. Seeing her again was a big relief.
“I feel a lot less all alone out here,” Nanie said.
Julie walked away from their meeting with mixed emotions. She was relieved that overall, Nanie seemed OK. The fears she had — that Nanie might have physically or mentally deteriorated due to drugs, or been forced to do sex work to survive — seemed unfounded. Nanie was safe from the elements in her RV and had a community of friends.

But the meeting also raised a big question: What could Julie do to help her sister?
Nanie says she wants a relationship, not help. In the past, after moving indoors, she became depressed. In her RV, within her street community, she feels like herself.
“For now,” Nanie said, “I’m content out here. And I guess what I want from her is to understand that.” 
Julie understands that as well as someone who hasn’t lived on the streets can — which is to say, not completely. She still wants to help, but she’s struggling with how. Part of her wants to open up her home so Nanie can shower, do laundry and hang out, while another part of her thinks she should instead set boundaries.
And then she feels guilty for even considering keeping her sister at a distance. 
“It’s tougher than I even imagined it would be,” Julie said. 
Does reconnecting with family help?
Programs throughout the state offer bus tickets out of town to unhoused people trying to reunite with family or friends. That can result in people simply becoming homeless again in a new location. But proponents say that if done with the proper support, sending someone back into the arms of loved ones can be a lifesaver. 
“We heal in community,” said Gabby Cordell, who runs the reunification program at the San Francisco-based nonprofit Miracle Messages. “We’re not meant to go through life alone. And everyone matters. Everyone is someone’s somebody.”
Using Google, social media and anything else they can think of, Miracle Messages helps unhoused clients find their mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, or anyone else they are looking for.
The organization receives about 50 referrals a month — mostly for cases within California, Cordell said. She and her team are able to find and get a hold of the person they’re looking for about half of the time. Sometimes, the family member is thrilled.
“It’s astounding how often we get an, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve been looking for him,’” she said.
Other times, the relationship has been badly damaged, and the family member isn’t interested in reconnecting. 
The group also offers the reverse, helping people who are housed find loved ones living on the street. That’s much harder, Cordell said. 
“Trying to find your brother is looking for a needle in a haystack,” she said. “Trying to find your brother who is unhoused is looking for a moving needle in 10 haystacks.”
The nonprofit has succeeded in arranging more than 115 of these more difficult reunions since around 2017, according to its website.
Nonprofit LifeMoves also offers reunification services across 17 of its homeless shelter and temporary housing sites in Silicon Valley. Only a small percentage of clients leave homelessness that way (the nonprofit doesn’t track exactly how many), said Heather Griffin, director of shelter and services for Santa Clara County. 
It’s impossible to know how successful these efforts are. Neither LifeMoves nor Miracle Messages tracks what happens to people after they reunite with family. 
‘That was hard:’ Another family reconnects after decades on the street
Ashanti Terrell lived a lot of her life without her father, Ashby Dancy. 
He was on and off the streets of Oakland for most of her childhood, while she grew up in and out of foster care and then with her mother’s family. She lost touch with him as the years passed and she earned a master’s degree, launched a career in public safety and had three children of her own in Atlanta. 
But as she got older, she felt a void. Her mother had died and her father was all she had left. 
“When I was 18 years old, (I) graduated, I had nobody to go to my graduation,” Terrell said. “I wanted my dad to at least be at my graduation. I haven’t gotten married because I wanted my dad to be there, you know. I haven’t done a lot of stuff because I wanted my dad.”
Terrell had glimpses of her father over the years. Two years ago, he landed in subsidized housing in Oakland and she went to visit him. But he didn’t know who she was, she said. Whether that was because of drug use, mental illness or both, she wasn’t sure. 
Last fall, Terrell got a call from a social worker. The social worker said her father was trying to get to Atlanta to see her, but got stuck in Texas and ended up in a hospital. Terrell started planning with her sister to help him. But when she called the hospital again, he was already gone. No one knew where. 
She decided to pack up her life in Georgia, move to the Bay Area, and find him.
Then, while Googling her father’s name, Terrell saw him quoted in an October CalMatters article — coincidentally, the same article that helped reunite Julie and Nanie Crossman. The article said he was at a tent encampment in East Oakland.

Terrell went looking. She drove around the area at different times of day, hoping to catch a glimpse of her father. She asked the workers at a nearby Burger King if they’d seen him. 
In March, Terrell emailed the CalMatters reporter for help. The reporter showed her where to find her father’s tarp-covered tent, sitting by itself on the sidewalk. 
After that, Terrell started visiting her father, stopping by to check on him, talk and give him food. 
On a recent Friday afternoon, she brought her 7-year-old son, Mekhi. Dancy gave the boy a fistbump and asked about his school, and about the family’s upcoming move to Oakland’s Temescal neighborhood. But then he started talking about the 22 kids he’d had with his ex-girlfriend (something Terrell is positive didn’t happen). He mumbled, making it hard for her to understand him. 
Mekhi asked his mom if they could buy Grandpa some Burger King, and she said yes, promising to come back with a burger after they picked the other kids up from school. 
“I just wanted to let you know that I’m here,” Terrell told her father, as they left. “As soon as I get myself together, I’m going to help you out.”
“I love you, sweetheart,” he said. And then to Mekhi: “Take care of your mom, OK?”
Terrell teared up as she and Mekhi walked away from her father’s tent. “That was hard,” she said.
He had admitted he was drunk, which disappointed her. Just like today’s Oakland — with its massive homeless encampment along East 12th Street — is unrecognizable as the city she grew up in, the man she just talked to is not the father who raised her. The father she remembers won trophies for boxing. He was a “big kid,” a gentle soul who ran around and played with her and her two sisters, did their hair in cute braids and took them camping.
“I don’t know who he is,” she said of the man in the tent. “I come from him, but I don’t know him.”

The last real memory Terrell has of her father is from July 1998, at the same Burger King across the street from her father’s tent. It was Terrell’s 8th birthday. She was in foster care, but was visiting with her parents at the fast food chain — her favorite — to celebrate. 
She moved with her mother to Chicago and then Atlanta shortly after, and lost touch with her father, who stayed behind in Oakland.
Now, Terrell wants to repair their relationship. She wants him to get to know his grandchildren, and she wants to take him to visit his 86-year-old mother in Stockton. 
She also wants to save him, before it’s too late. He’s 63, and Terrell is scared that if he stays outside, he’ll fall victim to fentanyl, or one of the many other dangers of the street.
Terrell imagines helping her father will involve rehab and an assessment of his mental state — if he’s willing. She wants to figure out why he lost his subsidized housing, and if he can get it back. But she’s not sure where to start.
“Maybe 20 years might be too late,” she said. “I don’t know.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/040825_Reunification_FM_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 09:08:33.796125

The $250 million, which would fund about 500 electric trucks serving the ports of LA and Long Beach, remains frozen as a legal dispute plays out between the EPA, a bank and a green energy group.


The Trump administration has frozen $250 million in grants to a nonprofit helping companies replace diesel trucks at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, part of a broad federal effort to claw back $20 billion in green energy funding.
The program by Climate United, announced last October, would offer affordable leases for new electric heavy-duty trucks operated by small fleets and individual truckers serving the ports.
Communities near the ports, including Wilmington, San Pedro and Long Beach, have been battling for years to clean up noxious fumes that waft into their neighborhoods from the long lines of trucks carrying cargo to and from the massive ports.
The freezing of the funds comes after California had to abandon a regulation that phased out diesel trucks because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump wouldn’t approve it. 
The grant, which would have funded about 500 electric trucks, remains frozen by Citibank, which holds the funds, as a legal dispute plays out between the EPA, the bank and Climate United, a nonprofit based in Maryland.
“We don’t have any money at all, not even operational money,” Climate United spokesperson Brooke Durham told CalMatters in an interview. “We are having to raise philanthropic grants to be able to cover operational expenses and payroll…. and then all of the projects are in limbo.”
The EPA had threatened to terminate the contracts, and climate groups sued over not being able to access the money when it was frozen. The groups argued that the EPA and the bank were illegally withholding the money because Congress had appropriated it through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. A federal judge ordered Citibank to pay some of the funds, but then an appeals court blocked that decision as the case continues.
In a March announcement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin accused the $20 billion federal green energy grant program of “misconduct, conflicts of interest, and potential fraud…I have taken action to terminate these grants riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending.” The agency, however, has not produced evidence of those claims.
Zeldin has repeatedly referenced a video by Project Veritas, a conservative group known for recording undercover videos, which secretly filmed a man it said was an EPA employee under the Biden administration saying the agency was “throwing gold bars off the Titanic,” meaning it was seeking to disburse funds after Donald Trump was elected but hadn’t taken office yet. 
Known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund but also called the “green bank,” the grants are awarded to nonprofits, banks and other groups. The $20 billion was awarded for a variety of projects nationwide.
Climate United representatives said Zeldin’s accusations don’t apply to their programs; the money was allocated before Trump was elected.
Climate United had launched other programs nationwide in addition to the California electric trucks program, according to the lawsuit. The EPA also froze its grants for $31.8 million in loans for solar power projects in rural communities in Arkansas and $63 million for solar power plant projects in partnership with tribal governments and communities. Its initial tribal and community solar projects were supposed to be located in Eastern Oregon and Idaho, according to the suit.
In addition, $30 million to help communities plan projects that “improved energy independence, cut pollution and lower costs” was frozen. Climate United had awarded $6.35 million to 22 projects in 18 states, focusing on tribal communities.When asked about the freezing of the funds for the port trucks, the EPA press office told CalMatters in an email that it “was not a party to grant agreements with subrecipients within the Biden-Harris ‘Gold Bar’ scheme, so we wouldn’t have that information.”
The freezing of the money has meant that the electric truck program cannot move forward at the nation’s busiest port complex. The investment was seen as a significant step toward electrifying California’s diesel trucks, which are among the biggest sources of air pollution in the LA basin.
The grants were intended to help small operators purchase cleaner vehicles in an industry that operates on a “razor thin profit model,” said Matt Schrap, chief executive of the Harbor Trucking Association.
Many small operators can’t afford electric trucks. An electric big rig can cost $400,000, compared to less than half that for a new diesel truck. What’s more, it’s often too difficult for small operators to get them financed, as they are a relatively new technology. Because there is currently no used market for them, banks have trouble assessing their value.
Residents of port communities have long complained of health effects, including asthma and headaches, from diesel trucks, which emit large quantities of soot and other pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses.Cleaning up diesel exhaust “is a literal case of life and death for a lot of our community members and our loved ones,” Paola Vargas, a Carson resident and organizer with nonprofit East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, told CalMatters in December. “Every day matters. Every day we don’t have (truck emissions) rules…is a day wasted and a day of harmful impacts for us.”

Finding a homeless loved one can be difficult. So can helping them once you’ve found them. Here are some tips from people who’ve been there.


If you’ve lost touch with a loved one and suspect they are living on the street, in their car or in shelters, it can be difficult to find them again. Once you’ve found them (or if you never lost touch) it can be just as hard to figure out how to help. CalMatters has compiled some tips from people who have been through that process, or have helped others through it.
How to find a homeless loved one

File a missing persons report, suggested Gabby Cordell, director of reunion services for the San Francisco-based nonprofit Miracle Messages. That way, every time the missing person has contact with law enforcement or enters a hospital, that report should come up, she said. The officer or hospital may tell the person that their family is looking for them. In some cases, the facility may even reach out to whoever filed the report.Families also can submit their case to Miracle Messages for help at miraclemessages.org/findthem.
Turn to social media. Robin Wells Plantz created the Missing & Homeless Facebook group 10 years ago to help reconnect families. She posts the stories of missing people, complete with photos and identifying details, in the hope that someone will see it and recognize the person. The page now has more than 100,000 followers, and Plantz has lost count of how many dozens of people it has helped reunite. She invites anyone searching for a homeless loved one to send a message to her via that group.She also encourages people to create a new Facebook page dedicated to finding their loved one, and share it as widely as possible. That way, anyone with a tip can send it to that page.
Hire a private investigator.
Try Googling, just in case your loved one was photographed or quoted in a news article about homelessness.
Talk to street outreach workers. Homeless shelters, soup kitchens and other facilities (especially medical facilities) probably won’t tell you if they’ve seen your loved one, in an effort to protect their privacy, Plantz said. You’ll have better luck asking the people who go to encampments and hand out food and other necessities, she said. Make fliers with your loved one’s photo and hand them out to as many outreach workers as you can, she advised. 
Don’t focus on their name. Many unhoused people go by a street name, or multiple street names, that are different from the name you know. When asking about your loved one, show photos instead, Plantz suggested. 
Be careful about sharing your phone number. Don’t put your phone number on a flier or Facebook page that will be widely distributed — that can lead to harassment and other problems, Plantz cautioned. Instead, direct people to Facebook or other places to report tips.
Don’t give up. Cordell remembers one case where she reconnected a man with his family after 40 years. In another case, a woman in Southern California was getting ready to hold a memorial for her sister, when the sister turned up on a street corner in San Francisco.“That’s the biggest thing: Don’t give up,” said Plantz, who has been searching for her mother for 30 years. “Would you want somebody to give up on you?”

How to help a homeless loved one

“Be patient. Manage expectations,” Cordell said. Don’t assume that you will be able to solve your loved one’s homelessness quickly or easily. “A lot happens for someone to typically end up in the situation they’re in, which means we can’t expect an immediate solution or an immediate fix,” said Heather Griffin, director of shelter and services for Silicon Valley-based nonprofit LifeMoves.
Allow time to repair the relationship. It will take time for both sides to heal emotionally, Griffin said. 
Ask questions. “I wouldn’t try to tell them to do anything,” said Deborah O’Dell, who runs a support group for the families of people with mental illnesses in Los Angeles County, which includes multiple participants who have a homeless loved one. “Just ask: ‘Hey, what’s your day like? What’s going on? What are you doing?’ And just listen. Don’t be judgmental. Just be an ear and listen. And then ask, ‘Is there anything that I can do to help?’ If there’s not, don’t try to do anything. Because you’ll just push them away from you.”
Touch them. “Be willing to give them a hug,” O’Dell said. “Just show them unconditional love.”
Call to check in. When O’Dell’s adult son was living in his truck, she called him every other day to make sure he had food, blankets and other necessities. If he needed something, she put money in his bank account. 
You can still help, even if your loved one doesn’t want to or isn’t ready to come inside – or if you aren’t ready to invite them into your home. You might be able to help them with other needs, such as accessing health care, searching for jobs or signing up for social services, Griffin said. 
Provide an address. It’s often difficult for unhoused people to receive money from Social Security and other benefits because they don’t have a fixed address. Consider letting them use your address to get checks and other important mail. You could also offer to keep their birth certificate and other identification safe, until they need it to apply for housing or other services. 
Create boundaries and stick to them if you invite your loved one into your home, O’Dell said. That could mean, for example, requiring that your loved one go to therapy once a month, or prohibiting drugs in your home. 
Understand that sometimes, you won’t be able to get your loved one off the streets – at least not yet. “Sometimes, you’ve got to love them where they’re at,” Plantz said. “And that’s the hardest. That’s the hardest of it all, is loving them where they’re at.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041825_Reunification_JK_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 09:08:33.796125
,California,2025-05-01 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,‘We’re here every day’: Inside the painstaking effort to heal LA’s troubled MacArthur Park,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/inside-effort-heal-macarthur-park/,"As many as 10 nonprofit organizations are working to resuscitate MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, cleaning streets, treating drug overdoses and calming gang tensions, among other things.","On a recent morning, Terry Bates approached a chain-link fence across from MacArthur Park as the Los Angeles neighborhood slowly came to life. His crew, Team 21, was responsible for cleaning the sidewalk and curb line along Alvarado Street, between Wilshire Boulevard and 6th Street.
Bates unlocked a padlock that tied two fences together, erected in January to keep out illegal vendors. Several workers, all employed by Chrysalis, a nonprofit under contract with the city, followed him inside.
They scooped up trash, scraped up debris and swept up patches of vomit. Everything went into bags. Fifteen minutes later, the stretch of muck had given way to a clean sidewalk. Team 21 moved on.
Bates, who grew up nearby and has been servicing the park since early this year, snapped a picture of the sidewalk before his team arrived, and another after they finished. 
“That’s our work,” he said. “Every day.”
Back from the curb, away from the street, merchants opened up their shops, nodding appreciatively to the clean sidewalk in front. 
“The businesses,” Bates noted, “love us for sure.”
This is civic reclamation in action. It is painstaking rather than revolutionary, methodical rather than abrupt. 
And it is a test of at least two important questions: Can Los Angeles, by devoting time and attention to the long-suffering area around historic MacArthur Park, actually make a difference for those who live and work there, those who have despaired as the park has become a magnet for drugs, gangs and crime? And, perhaps more importantly, even if the city can effect that change, can it make it last? 
Chrysalis, an organization that employs people who are or have recently experienced homelessness, is 1 of 10 nonprofits working to resuscitate the park and surrounding neighborhoods. Under contracts with the city and county, these groups are cleaning streets, intervening during drug overdoses, calming gang tensions and treating wounds, among other things. 
Together, they represent a kind of strike force, swarming the community with assistance on the theory that reviving the area starts with stabilizing it after a long descent.

MacArthur Park once was a source of civic pride in Los Angeles, home to fancy hotels and swanky residences. Its playgrounds were full. Its bandshell was a desirable place to gather for musical performances. But that was a long time ago.
In recent years, the park has slid from attraction to nuisance. By last year, the park was home to scores of unhoused people, and its periphery had become a bustling market for drugs, available to anyone with the desire to approach a street vendor and put up cash for meth or opioids. Drugs and desperation drew the interest of gangs, which used the park to fence stolen goods and sell drugs. Violent crime followed. Neighbors and businesses cowered in fear or fled the area.

It was the crime that drew the city’s attention, and in early 2025, the city leadership sent in the Los Angeles Police Department. Foot patrols are seemingly constant. Police cars regularly stop at entrances, as officers fan out to check for drugs or other illicit activity. Serious crimes — homicides, assaults, robberies — have fallen as the police have made their presence known.

But a neighborhood is more than the sum of its crimes. And law enforcement can only do so much to construct and sustain community life.
That’s where the nonprofits come in.
Led by City Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, local community groups have been tapped to handle many of the park’s most critical needs. Homies Unidos and Healing Urban Barrios connect with gangs in the area, easing tensions when there is violence or the threat of it. The L.A. Care MacArthur Park Care Collaborative and Field Medicine Program provides so-called wraparound care to the homeless people in the area. An overdose response team from Homeless Health Care Los Angeles roams the park during the day looking for signs of people experiencing a drug crisis. 
Opioids are what rivets their attention. When meth users take too much, they get frantic and can be alarming. When the drug is an opioid, however, the user can quietly slump away, breath ebbing, heart slowing, until they simply die. The mobile units are attuned to the sight of slumping bodies and have intervened in some 60 cases since launching late last year.
“The work these groups are doing on the ground is part of a bigger movement we’re leading to end the cycle of neglect and disinvestment at MacArthur Park,” said Naomi Villagomez Roochnik, deputy director of communications for the council member. “Since 2023, we’ve brought over $25 million in new funding into the park and the Westlake neighborhood.”
Life in the park reflects the combined efforts of all these organizations. Men and women in yellow vests snap up trash and pick their way through pockets of older men lolling under the influence and younger men keeping an eye out for the police.
The groups keep eyes on each other, and residents thread their way through them. One morning last week, a father walked his son to a bus stop, the boy holding on tight to his dad’s hand as they picked through the morning rush. The boy smiled at the Chrysalis team, which waved back. Nearby, a young woman with threadbare clothes and a face smudged with dirt slowly wheeled through an intersection in her wheelchair.
Jessica L., who declined to share her last name, said she’d been living on the streets near the park for about three months, since her husband died of a heart attack and she could no longer afford her rent. A native of New York, she said incidents in the park were common but were under better control in recent weeks.
“They keep it pretty neat,” she said of the cleanup crews.

It’s a difficult job, and there have been unwelcome surprises. When police initially swarmed to disrupt the illegal vending, it drove down violent crime but also produced a brief uptick in overdoses. Buyers were forced to find new dealers, and the new batches of drugs were sometimes of different potencies. 
“Substance supply wasn’t consistent,” said Aurora Morales, associate director of community initiatives for Homeless Health Care L.A.
As the effort unfolds, many people involved are learning as they go.
For the neighborhood, this influx of help is a welcome relief, visible in the greetings of store owners and parents walking children to the bus stop. But it’s not the ultimate measure of success. 
Lasting change will come when the nonprofits and the police are not needed, at least at this intensity. It will be recognizable when the playgrounds return to life, when the streets are clean without fences, when Bates and Team 21 don’t need to arrive before shops open to make their rounds.

Until then, “we’re here every day,” Bates said. And we’re making progress. You can see,” he continued, pointing to the area his crew had just finished, “the guys do a really good job.”
He locked up the fence again, and the crew moved on.

(Courtesy of Marcella Patino)Marcella Patino, 34, knows the difficulties of navigating work requirements. 
Patino, who works full time as a nail technician and esthetician at a salon in Holladay, is a single mother of three. She relies on financial assistance for child care — $600 a month for day care — so she can keep working full time, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits — around $400 a month — to keep food on the table for her family. 
To receive that financial assistance, she and her employer must already prove to state officials that she’s working. Lately, Patino said it’s been easier to produce the required documentation and jump through the administrative hoops. But she said that’s only because her employer keeps track of her hours and willingly validates them with the government. 
That hasn’t always been the case, she said. 
“It was a huge issue,” she said, adding that “in the past, it was really hard” because her previous employers did not log her hours on her paychecks. She said she’d been cut off from those benefits multiple times because her previous bosses wouldn’t fill out the required paperwork or would drag their feet to prove she indeed worked the required hours.

Luckily, she said now her current employer cooperates. So balancing her job, taking care of kids and making ends meet has been easier than it has been in the past, but Patino said the work requirements still add “constant” stress and uncertainty to daily life. 
“I still worry about my hours,” she said.
Child care assistance and SNAP benefits already have work requirements. But there’s another crucial program for low-income Utahns that state officials are looking to re-impose that requirement on — after more than five years of it being suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
And it could put thousands of Utahns at risk of losing their medical coverage. 
Utah is the next state in a national movement looking to impose work requirements on certain Medicaid recipients under a Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump. 
Leaders of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intend to submit for a new federal waiver to re-implement work requirements on the state’s Medicaid expansion program, with a list of allowable exemptions. That list excludes those working at least 30 hours a week, those who are 60 or older, pregnant, physically or mentally unable to meet the requirements, parents with a child dependent under the age of 6, among others. 
Currently, about 75,000 adult Utahns are enrolled in the state’s expansion program, which allows Medicaid eligibility to Utahns whose annual income is up to 133% of the federal poverty level (roughly $20,800 for an individual or $42,760 for a family of four, according to national thresholds). The federal government covers $90% of the cost of the medical coverage, while the state pays for the remaining 10%. 
Of those 75,000 adults enrolled, an estimated 7,900 (or 10%) would not fall under an exemption and be subject to work requirements if the state submits the waiver and it’s approved by federal officials under President Donald Trump’s administration, according to state Medicaid officials. 
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

That means 7,900 Utahns — if they don’t start working or submit documentation showing they’re applying for at least 48 jobs during a three-month period, along with completing required online job training with the state — could lose their Medicaid coverage. 
That’s according to Jennifer Strohecker, the state’s Medicaid director, who this week confirmed to Utah News Dispatch that leaders of DHHS intend to re-submit the work requirement waiver to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) “sometime in June.” 
But first, state officials must hold a 30-day public comment period to field input on the proposed waiver. Friday, the DHHS will be holding the first of two public hearings. It’s scheduled to take place at 12:30 p.m., at the Multi-Agency State Office Building, at 195 N. 1950 West in Salt Lake City. The state will also be offering a virtual option to join the meeting. 
“I can say now the intent is to submit (the waiver), but we will evaluate all the public comments that we receive … and take that into consideration as we evaluate the proposal that’s been drafted and consider what the next steps are,” Strohecker said. “But at this point, yes, the intent is to submit the waiver.” 
‘Inefficiency and cruelty,’ advocates say of work requirements
Low-income, disability and health advocates are sounding alarms about state officials’ decision to pursue that work requirement again, raising concerns that it will impose administrative burdens on an already vulnerable population of Utahns and will inevitably result in loss of medical benefits for many. 
“It’s forcing red tape upon people that will ultimately just act like scissors because it’s going to cut so much coverage,” said Stephanie Burdick, consumer representative on the state’s Medical Care Advisory Committee. 
Evan Done, advocacy and public policy director for USARA, a nonprofit serving Utahns recovering from the effects of substance use disorders, said implementing the work requirements would be a cut to Medicaid, plain and simple.

– Stephanie Burdick, consumer representative on the state’s Medical Care Advisory Committee


“A cut by any other name is still a cut,” Done said. “Medicaid serves as a vital lifeline for many Utahns. Evidence shows work requirements often cause people to lose healthcare coverage due to the administrative complexity of navigating the system, rather than an unwillingness to work. Utah’s attempt to implement a work requirement for Medicaid beneficiaries aims to save money by cutting otherwise deserving recipients from care.” 
Nate Crippes with the Disability Law Center, an organization that advocates for Utahns with disabilities, also described the proposed work requirement as “nothing more than a cut to (Medicaid) services.” 
“While the state has exempted people with disabilities, we know the paperwork required will also lead to numerous individuals with disabilities, especially those with mental illness, being kicked off of Medicaid,” Crippes said. “We are working hard to oppose cuts at the federal level, and we would encourage our state leaders to rescind this proposal and help us ensure that Medicaid is protected.”
Of the 75,000 enrolled in Utah’s Medicaid expansion program, 22,000 were homeless last year, according to DHHS estimates, and many have substance use or mental health conditions that they receive treatment for, Burdick said. 
Burdick acknowledged that yes, 90% of Utahns enrolled in the state’s Medicaid expansion program would be exempt, “but how they prove that they’re exempt is where it becomes an administrative burden.” 
Bill Tibbitts, deputy executive director of the Crossroads Urban Center, an advocacy group for low-income Utahns, encouraged state leaders to instead create a voluntary program to help people working low-wage jobs without healthcare benefits to get better jobs.

“People who are homeless and working out of their car do not need extra negative incentives to want to find a better job,” Tibbitts said. “Threatening to take away people’s healthcare if they do not do a bunch of busywork is not really helpful – especially if most of the 48 jobs people are being forced to apply for do not have better pay or provide health insurance benefits.”
Burdick urged state leaders to take a different route, not resort to requirements that will only create a “vicious cycle of inefficiency and cruelty.” 
“(These people) deserve to be treated with dignity,” she said. “They don’t deserve to be stacked with paperwork that could lead to them losing coverage and potentially losing their life or having severely more negative health outcomes.” 
Strohecker stressed that Utah’s yet-to-be filed waiver is not yet final, and state officials welcome feedback. 
“This is a proposal. It can be modified, we can make adjustments based on the feedback that we get,” she said.

Addressing advocates’ concerns, Strohecker said “there’s also opportunities to build good supports that will help people actually connect to training or education or even employment services. And what do those support services look like?”
Strohecker also pointed out some details that differentiate Utah’s proposed waiver. She noted that previously, if a person did not fulfill requirements for Medicaid coverage within the first three months, their coverage would be terminated.
“But in this iteration we’re actually suspending coverage, giving them additional opportunity to fulfill those requirements for an additional three months,” she said. 
Strohecker also said in their proposal, state officials have “built in something that we’re calling member supports, and that’s to be defined as we work with CMS and work with our partners to really consider what are the opportunities that we have to really connect a person to job training to employment opportunities, to really fulfill some of the community engagement requirements that are outlined, and how do we support the individual along that pathway of compliance?”
That’s a “key piece that would be really helpful,” Strohecker said, to have partnership with our advocates and community stakeholders to really envision the array of services that we could build to assist the person in fulfilling community engagement and actually truly getting connected to job training, employment supports … that we could actually help facilitate that in a meaningful way.” 
Why is Utah looking to re-impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion?
Strohecker said there’s important historical context that precedes state agency leaders’ decision to resubmit the waiver. 
After Utah voters approved Medicaid expansion by a ballot initiative in 2018, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature was forced to act. In 2019, the Utah Legislature passed legislation to implement the state’s Medicaid expansion program. Strohecker pointed to that law, which requires state officials to apply to CMS for a waiver that, among other provisions, includes “a path to self-sufficiency, including work activities” as defined by federal law. 
In 2020, state officials included a work requirement in their waiver request, and after it was approved by CMS (at the time under Trump’s first administration) that requirement went into effect January that year. However, it only lasted a few months, because by April 2020 it was suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Then, in 2021, when Utah’s waiver was up for renewal, former President Joe Biden’s administration required the state to remove that work requirement.

Now, with Trump back in the White House and a new administration that’s likely to approve a waiver that includes a work requirement, Utah officials have decided to resubmit it.  
“There is historic precedent to this, but also as we consider what’s happening on the federal side of things today, it is our intent to align our program with our current federal initiatives and priorities,” Strohecker said. “Certainly mandated work requirements are considered a top item by Congress as far as looking at the budget reconciliation package. And I think our intent was to align with sort of our past approved waiver, and this administration’s current initiatives.” 
Pressed on who specifically made the decision to include the work requirement in the new waiver application, Strohecker said leaders of Utah Department of Health and Human Services ultimately made the decision, but that they also did so based on talks with legislators and Gov. Spencer Cox’s office. 
“It’s actually a decision by the department to take this step,” she said. “It was definitely done in consultation with the governor’s office and lawmakers. But I would say it was a decision by the department.” 
Advocates say Utah doesn’t need to pursue a new waiver — and shouldn’t
Burdick argues Utah’s Medicaid statute does not explicitly require state officials to submit the waiver again years after it was pulled back. She also contends it’s not needed, pointing out Utah’s Medicaid expansion fund “has gotten quite large,” with more than $300 million available to use. 
“It’s not like they’re running out of money,” she said. “There’s definitely people who are eligible and not enrolled in Medicaid expansion right now. … We have a bunch of money, and yet we’re going to implement a work requirement?” 
Utah is just the latest state to pursue the work requirement under the new federal landscape. Republicans in Congress and several other states including Ohio, Iowa and Montana are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage people to find jobs and ultimately reduce their need for public assistance, the health policy outlet KFF Health News reported. But, the outlet also pointed out, few programs actually help enrollees find jobs. 
Under Trump, many states might pursue Medicaid work requirements

Last week, Paul Ray — who served as a Republican House lawmaker before resigning in 2021 and taking a position as director of legislative affairs for the DHHS — sent an email to lawmakers notifying them of the looming waiver request.
In that email, Ray said the state aims to implement the requirement (referred to as a “community engagement requirement”) to “increase an individual’s health and wellbeing through incentivizing work and community engagement; increase their sense of purpose; help build a healthy lifestyle; and increase employment and wage earnings of able-bodied adults while focusing funding on the state’s neediest individuals.” 
However, Burdick argued states like Arkansas that have tried work requirements for Medicaid have found they were burdensome, led to adverse effects on even working adults, and resulted in loss of coverage for thousands. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services also recently issued a report estimating the financial impact of implementing work requirements, which would result in an increase of up to $6 million a year for administrative costs and $60 million a year for employment and training services. 
Burdick said work requirements are actually less fiscally responsible — not more. 
“You’re wasting taxpayer dollars by not spending the expansion money,” she said. “Then you’re going to take more taxpayer dollars to deal with the administrative burden.” 
Asked about whether state officials have an estimated cost of what it would cost the state to implement its work requirements, Strohecker said given it’s still a proposal that has not yet been formalized, “we don’t have costs estimated.” 
In response to calls to implement an employment support program rather than hinging Medicaid coverage on a work requirement, Strohecker said state officials “want that feedback” during the public comment period that’s now open. 
“We’d like to hear what the public has to say regarding employment supports and how this could be meaningful for folks, recognizing that we’ll have to work to mitigate what could be an administrative barrier,” she said. “We could work through some of those challenges … to support individuals in achieving our goals.”

Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, speaks to a colleague on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on Feb. 11, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee approved legislation that enhances immunity protection for law enforcement when they are faced with either criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits.
HB 202, sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, changes the standard by which law enforcement can claim immunity as they perform their jobs and gives them additional procedural protections during litigation.
“I know a couple of the members have worked closely with our team on a couple of amendments,” Reynolds told the Senate Judiciary Committee during a meeting on Wednesday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The committee approved the bill 9-4 along party lines after approving amendments that would review the impact on the legislation and report the race of individuals and the circumstances surrounding the incidents.
Reynolds’ bill has faced opposition from Democrats and civil rights groups, who said the legislation would make it difficult to hold law enforcement accountable for alleged wrongdoing.
Supporters including the Alabama Sheriff’s Association said it reflects the decisions made in the courts on immunity.
The bill changes the standard for immunity from prosecution. Currently, law enforcement officers may have prosecution or lawsuits if they act “willfully, maliciously, fraudulently, in bad faith, beyond his or her authority, or under a mistaken interpretation of the law.” Under Reynolds’ bill, the officer would have to violate rights specifically laid out in the constitutions of Alabama or the United States.
The legislation allows law enforcement a hearing at the start of any civil or criminal case to determine whether the law enforcement officer was acting within his or her discretionary authority. If the court rules the behavior acted within that discretionary authority, the case is dismissed.
If the appeal is rejected, the law enforcement officer may appeal the verdict to the Alabama Supreme Court. Lawmakers approved an amendment that sets a time limit for submitting appeals. If the appeal is rejected, the officer may continue to assert that defense as the case proceeds in court.
The legislation also prevents a plaintiff from gathering evidence in discovery in civil cases when the law enforcement officer requests the court dismiss the case.
Members of the committee approved a few amendments that modified the legislation on the periphery. One was proposed by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, that allowed plaintiffs to obtain video footage of the incident that pertains to civil lawsuits, but not criminal cases.
Another amendment proposed by Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, creates a study commission to evaluate the impact the legislation had on law enforcement recruitment and retention, one of the main justifications that Reynolds proposed the legislation.
A third amendment, also by Singleton, requires law enforcement agencies to collect and submit data to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency regarding the type of excessive force committed by law enforcement officers and the race and ethnicity of both the officer and the victim.
One proposal offered by Singleton was rejected that would have required law enforcement agencies to adopt written policies that officers would follow while performing their duties before they are given immunity.
“The impetus of this is to make sure there is a written policy that these officers have to go by, we are not just going out there going against the Constitution, so that there is a policy where they can be trained on,” Singleton said. “We will know there is a written policy to go by.”
Reynolds said he agreed with the proposal in principle but said he was against the amendment.
“I would not want to impose this on sheriffs in the state because they are not even APOSTC (Alabama Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission) certified,” Reynolds said. “There may be some throughout those ranks, but it impacts a lot of things.”
Other Democrats also agreed with Singleton’s amendment.
“To me, there is nothing like transparency, and everybody knows the rules and regulations so they can all be on the same page and be all treated the same,” Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile.
Republicans on the committee opposed the amendment.
“While I think, especially in my department, we have very sophisticated police departments and sheriff’s offices, this is a model, written policy that may or may not exist currently from APOSTC and specifies what should be in the policy,” said Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Fairhope. “That may or may not differ from the policies that are in effect in our local police departments or sheriffs.”
The bill moves to the Senate. There are four days left in the 2025 legislative session.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)A bill before state lawmakers would allow Southwest Gas and other natural gas utilities in the state to ask the Public Utilities Commission to depart from traditional rate-setting in favor of alternative rate-making, a policy shift that could pose a cost burden to customers, according to opponents. 
Southwest Gas currently applies for rate increases via a general rate case every three years, in which the PUC analyzes the utility’s expenses and revenue requirements, and adds in a permitted rate of return for the company. 
Alternative rate-making allows the utility to submit a rate plan determined by additional factors, and potentially extend the rate, which could be automatically adjusted via a predetermined formula, for longer than three years. 
“Nothing in this bill removes any of the PUC’s authority over the rate-making process. It does not issue Southwest Gas, or any other natural gas utility, a blank check to raise rates on its customers,” said Scott Leedom, director of regulation and public affairs for Southwest Gas, at a hearing before the Senate Committee on Growth and Infrastructure in April. 
Senate Bill 417 suggests a number of rate-making mechanisms for which natural gas utilities could apply:  

Performance-based rates, which are tied to outcomes, such as a utility’s ability to reduce carbon emissions or increase efficiency. The utility’s success in achieving the goal determines the rate;
Decoupling, or disassociating a utility’s financial results from the sale of natural gas, thereby eliminating the utility’s incentive to promote consumption; and,
Multi-year rate plans, which call for the PUC to set rates beyond the three-year duration set in general rate cases. 

An amendment to SB 417 proposes allowing the PUC to establish methods to automatically adjust rates based on a pre-determined formula. The formula can include a method to recover the costs of capital expenditures, be adjusted for accumulated depreciation, deferred taxes, property taxes “and any other costs established by the Commission.” 
Proponents suggest formula rates streamline the lengthy and complicated process of a general rate case.
Alternative rate-making creates more predictable rate changes and lowers administrative costs, with the savings passed on to consumers, Leedom said, adding rate changes would “potentially no longer have the cumulative stair-step increases to reflect the cost of providing service and rates. Instead, these adjustments would be smoother and incrementally smaller.” 
Proponents, which include the Retail Association of Nevada, the Nevada Trucking Association, and a variety of chambers of commerce, cited predictability and the potential for lower costs in their testimony supporting the measure. 
SB 417, they contend, mirrors a 2019 bill sponsored by then-Sen. Chris Brooks, which allowed electric utilities to apply for alternative ratemaking.  The measure was signed into law by then-Gov. Steve Sisolak. 
“It is not a mirror of SB 300,” said  Ernest Figueroa, Consumer Advocate and Chief Deputy Attorney General of the Bureau of Consumer Protection. The measure, unlike SB 300, Figueroa said, does not state how the plan “aligns an economically viable utility model to state public policy goals.”   
Additionally, Figueroa said he believes the inclusion of provisions regarding formula rates “unfairly tips the scales in the utility’s favor to the detriment of the ratepayer.”
Other opponents, including the Sierra Club and the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, argue the proposed process is opaque.
Kristee Watson of the Nevada Conservation League noted that lawmakers, in the 2023 legislative session, established an integrated resource planning process for natural gas utilities.  Southwest Gas is slated to file its first IRP this summer. Watson said that process should be permitted to play out before considering alternative rate-making. 
“This is not the time to give gas utilities more tools to raise rates with less scrutiny,” she said. 
Last year, Arizona’s five-member elected body of utility regulators passed a measure approving formula rate plans for utilities, including Southwest Gas, which also operates in that state. 
“Consumer advocates in Arizona and nationally have warned against ratemaking plans that reward utilities for engaging in high risk planning that can often lead to devastating consequences for ratepayers,” reports the Energy and Policy Institute. 
Jermareon Williams, government affairs manager for Western Resource Advocates, an environmental nonprofit, testified that general rate cases “act as safeguards for customers and shelter them from unneeded investments a utility may choose to pursue to increase their profits.” 
The Senate passed the measure 21-0. 
Reno resident Bari Levinson, a member of the Energy Coalition, testified that former Nevada Consumer Advocate Jon Wellinghoff, who also served as a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), opposes the measure.  In a statement read by Levinson, Wellinghoff said that giving Southwest Gas “the right to have their rates set on a future test year with estimated costs used to set rates charged to customers, rather than using actual known and experienced expenses will definitely drive up costs for consumers. We do not want our rates to skyrocket like they have in California.”
California began decoupling electric and gas rates in the early 1980s. 
Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, who chairs the Senate Committee on Growth and Infrastructure, asked PUC attorney Garret Weir if the bill lacks guardrails present in SB 300, as opponents asserted. 
Weir, who testified in neutral, said he was unaware of any guardrails in SB 300, but noted the PUC imposed “robust regulations” via rulemaking. He also noted the legislation only allows natural gas utilities to apply to the PUC for alternative rulemaking.
“Ultimately, the commission would still have the obligation to ensure that any rates adopted pursuant to this statute were just and reasonable and in the public interest,” he said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC06367-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 08:02:33.957945

Jackie Ormes became the first known Black cartoonist whose work was read coast to coast through the major black publication, the Pittsburgh Courier.

The law currently prohibits such discussions in K-5, but Butler’s bill expands it to pre-K-12 to be in line with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January. 
“When a student enters a school, they still carry with them their First Amendment rights. They can absolutely talk to a nurse, a teacher, a counselor, whoever they want,” Butler said. “This is banning classroom discussions.”

The Senate Education Policy Committee also held a public hearing on the legislation, which was heavily populated by opponents.

Paige Gant, a math professor, said the legislation does not accomplish anything.
“Kids in middle school and high school are aware that gay and transgender people exist as they have access to the internet,” she said. “Attempting to stifle discussions of such topics will not change these realities.”
The legislation also bans insignia like pride flags from being displayed in a classroom. Gant added that the bill only bans such in a classroom and not in a hallway where students could still be around them.
“This bill is frankly a waste of the Senate’s time,” she said.
Erin DeJager also spoke against the bill, arguing that it bans something that is not defined in Alabama law. The Legislature rushed a bill that defines sex-based terms at the beginning of the 2025 session.
“This term, ‘gender identity,’ is used to describe flags or insignia. This can be interpreted to be a box of girl scout cookies, as the Girl Scouts are certainly based on gender identity,” she said. 
The lone supporter of the bill that spoke, Ted Halley, who said he “detransitioned” back to male after 12 years of identifying as a woman, repeated his comments from other related public hearings.
“When you enter the glitter club, you’re welcomed. But when you leave, you get a target on your back,” he said. 
Detransition and regret are different concepts, a Harvard Medical School study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism suggests, which may overlap in some people, but they are “sometimes mistakenly viewed as synonymous.” Halley also spoke in favor of a bill Wednesday to allow parents to claim religious exemptions from vaccines without giving a reason.

Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, said the Legislature does not get to legislate morality.
“You lost me when you said the executive order of President Trump. The gentleman has 34 felonies,” he said. “In addition to that, woke is this strange kind of language that’s being used. I’d rather be woke than asleep.”
Hatcher was the sole “no” vote, but Sen. Randy Price, R-Opelika, said he had reservations about the bill. 
“If you’re going to take a bill that’s going to take this type of stand in our school systems, we should have seen this bill the first week,” he said in an interview. “It’s just a timing thing.”
Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, the chair of the committee, told Butler after the bill was approved that it is unlikely the Senate will pass it because of the timing. 
“We’re going to get it out of committee, but I’m not going to make any promises as to where this bill goes from here,” Chesteen said. “If you’re going to bring something like this next year, you need to get it early so that we’re not backed up with all the House bills that we currently have before we try to move forward with anything like this.”
Although the bill was filed early in the session, the House Education Policy committee did not approve the legislation until April 10, after a public hearing on April 3.
There are four legislative days left in the 2025 legislative session.

(Photo courtesy of City of Las Vegas)AmeriCorps service members who helped with tutoring students, school literacy programs and wildfire mitigation were among the 163 people in Nevada recently terminated after President Donald Trump’s administration abruptly stopped federal funding to the 30-year-old program.
AmeriCorps is a federal agency that supports and funds national service throughout the country.
Organizations in the state, as well as throughout the country, that relied on AmeriCorps grant funding  received letters last week telling them to “immediately cease all award activities” after the administration “determined that the award no longer effectuates agency priorities.”
Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford on Tuesday announced he joined a lawsuit along with 22 other Democratic attorneys general challenging the constitutionality of the administration stopping funding. 
“The Trump administration does not have the legal ability to dismantle this agency unilaterally. Congress has created AmeriCorps to give Americans the ability to help their communities during times of need, and the president cannot handwave away the decisions of Congress,” Ford said in a statement.
Nevada Current asked Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has made education the centerpiece of his agenda, about the cuts to AmeriCorps programs in Nevada and whether he supported the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of those cuts. 
His office didn’t respond. 
The lawsuit argues that the administration “is free to ask Congress to abolish AmeriCorps, but it cannot simply terminate the agency’s functions.” In doing so is a violation of the separation of powers under the U.S. Constitution.
Though the lawsuit seeks to restore already allocated funding, the cuts are already “going to have a significant impact on Nevadans,” said Zanny Marsh, executive director with Nevada Volunteers, which oversees AmeriCorps funding in Nevada. 
The 163 AmeriCorps members terminated were placed in programs ranging from Pre-K through 12 tutoring programs to health and wellness programs throughout the state, Marsh said. They had served a combined 144,925 hours, she said.
“We have service members who are mitigating areas more prone to wild fire and creating more wild fire resilience and resistance in communities,” Marsh said. “We had mentors and tutors in Nevada classrooms all over the state.”
The positions still had about a third of their contract still remaining. The swift termination of funding caught Nevada Volunteers off guard.
Rather than abrupt cuts, Marsh said it would have made more sense if the administration reached out and had “given a dollar amount” of how much needed to be cut, allowing Nevada Volunteers to “approach it using a criteria that made sense to us.”
“If circumstances were different, we would have loved to be consulted with the agency in determining what cuts we could have made,” she said. “It would still have been painful but we would have done it differently. Because we weren’t consulted and the decisions were already made then it just felt like it caught us off guard.”
AmeriCorps had grants terminated for programs with the City of Las Vegas, the City of Henderson, Walker Basin Conservancy, Nevada Outdoor School, United Way of Northern Nevada and the Sierra, the Good Deed Project, Improve Your Tomorrow, Healthy Communities Coalition of Lyon and Storey Counties, Volunteer Generation Fund, and VISTA Intermediary.
In an email to the Current, City of Las Vegas spokesman Jace Radke said AmeriCorps grants supported 66 positions.
ReInvent Schools Las Vegas, which served several underserved schools within the city, relied on AmeriCrops grants to fund 32 literacy mentors, eight chronic absenteeism mentors and four nutrition mentors, Radke said. 
Four positions with the city’s mobile pre-K program were cut as well as four mentors with the city’s charter school, Strong Start Academy Elementary School.
Radke said programs are expected to continue operating but may have to scale back certain components.
The City of Henderson said it is still “currently assessing the potential impact of these cuts on our program” in an email to the Current Tuesday. 
Not every program that relied on AmeriCorps was affected, Marsh said. Opportunity Village, Great Basin Institute, Nevada Conservation Corps, and Truckee Meadows Parks Foundation weren’t included. 
Despite much uncertainty, Marsh didn’t discount the possibility of Nevada seeing future funding for AmeriCorps.  
“We are hopeful and planning that our grantees will have another opportunity to participate in the AmeriCorps program this fall,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/43270865240_dff471c502_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 08:02:33.957945

SB 85, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would also require public institutions of higher education to offer both religious and medical exemptions to vaccine or testing requirements.
“The [current] process is cumbersome. Some feel like it’s harassment,” claimed Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, who is handling the bill in the House. “You have to go to the Department of Education, watch a video and sign some stuff, and some parents have really felt harassed by that for their religious liberties and parental rights.”

Alabama’s measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination rate among kindergartners was just under 93.8% in the 2023-2024 school year, a decrease from the 95% rate in the 2021-2022 school year, which is considered herd immunity.
Apriell Hartsfield, Kids Count director for VOICES for Alabama Children, said immunosuppressed children and infants too young for vaccinations could face consequences if more people choose to skip vaccinations. She said that the current system allows for effective monitoring of exemptions and rapid response to potential outbreaks of contagious diseases.
“This bill, by throwing out a system that works in favor of one that is random and unsystematic, will prevent health officials from being prepared to respond rapidly to outbreaks, and with highly contagious diseases that can spread rapidly, such as measles … time is of the essence, and systems that allow rapid response benefit the public’s health,” Hartsfield said during the hearing.  
Hartsfield said after the meeting that measles outbreaks are particularly dangerous, saying that children don’t receive the MMR vaccine until about 18 months of age, making day care centers particularly vulnerable, which could have a negative impact on the economy. She said that if day care centers have to close temporarily, as they did during the height of the COVID pandemic, parents may not be able to get to work.
“What are these parents going to do who are relying on childcare to be able to work and provide for their families? What are these businesses going to do who are relying on their workers to come in and do their job? It’s just going to put everybody in a really bad position,” Hartsfield said.
One person spoke in favor of the bill. Ted Halley, a Prattville resident who spoke Tuesday in favor of banning drag performances in libraries and public schools, said that vaccines should “not [be] forced on down our throats.”
 “As you know, there’s two sides of every coin. Some people love the COVID vaccine. Some people like me hate it,” Halley said, pointing to unfounded claims of adverse effects from the vaccine. Halley also spoke Wednesday in favor of a bill extending the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” ban in public schools.

Rep. Frances Holk-Jones, R-Foley, asked about the bill’s language, specifically the term “testing,” and asked for clarification on whether it referred to school tests or medical tests.
“Your bill is not specific. It just strictly says all testing,” Holk-Jones said.
Butler said that is something they can fix.
Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, also expressed concern about the religious basis of the exemption, saying that he couldn’t find any religious denomination that explicitly forbids vaccines.
“So, I’m just wondering, why don’t we just call this what it is, which is a personal exemption, instead of trying to call it a religious exemption?” Rafferty asked, but Butler maintained it is a religious exemption.
The bill passed the committee on a voice vote and moves to the House floor for further consideration.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A coalition of ranking Indiana University alumni voiced “alarm and anger” Wednesday to new state policy that eliminates alumni input in the selection of university trustees and instead gives decision-making power over the board’s membership to the governor. 
The letter signed by 26 former chairs of the Board of Managers for IU’s Alumni Association was in response to provisions that were quietly added to the final draft of the next state budget giving Gov. Mike Braun full control over the membership of IU’s board of trustees. The Board of Managers is the supervisory panel for the university’s alumni association.

Separately, the board of trustees serves as the governing body for the state’s largest postsecondary institution. 
Under current law, Indiana’s governor appoints five members to IU’s board and picks one student representative with the help of a student-led committee. Three other members must be IU graduates and are elected by other alumni.
“This short-sighted act, written in a cowardly way so as to prohibit public discussion, tells our alumni that their voices through the ballot box are less important than that of one person who will do the choosing in the future,” alumni wrote. Four of the letter’s signatories additionally served terms as board trustees.
“Trustees are not elected due to their politics but for their beliefs about improving and strengthening the quality of education for students and operating the university in a fiscally sound manner,” the letter continued. “If disenfranchised from voting, how would alumni ever feel they have a voice in the affairs of the university in other ways? Why would they ever want to provide any support?”
Braun defended the policy move, emphasizing to reporters Wednesday afternoon that just 1.7% of IU alumni participated in past votes to elect trustees.
“It wasn’t representative. It enabled a clique of a few people to actually determine three board members. And I don’t think that is real representation,” Braun said. “If it was more broadly ascribed to, it would be different.”

He said the language “came collectively from folks in the legislature” while legislative leaders refused to say who requested it. 
“All the other universities seem to have more value in terms of the education they’re giving us for the cost, and those three trustees that were being arranged by just a small percentage of alumni didn’t make sense,” Braun said.
The provision slipped into the new state budget stipulates that all nine members are to be appointed by the governor. Another section gives the governor authority to, “at any time,” remove and replace a board member who was previously elected by the IU alumni.
Braun says he’ll keep current board members
If the governor swaps a member out, the new appointee serves until the expiration of the term of the replaced member. Otherwise, any of the existing members elected by IU alumni are allowed to serve out the rest of their term. 
The governor suggested Wednesday that he will retain the board’s three sitting alumni appointees and allow them to serve out the rest of their terms.










Trustees are not elected due to their politics but for their beliefs about improving and strengthening the quality of education for students and operating the university in a fiscally sound manner.


– an April 30 letter signed by 26 ranking Indiana University alumni


“I don’t think their terms are that far away from expiring,” Braun said. “I haven’t thought about anything other than … you can’t imagine the number of people that are interested in being a trustee at IU.”
Other new rules require that at least five of the members appointed to the board must be alumni, and five must be residents of Indiana.
The provisions did not appear in previous versions of the state budget.
When questioned about the last-minute move by lawmakers to approve the language, Braun held that “some things, yes, maybe should go through committee and so forth.” But he did not make clear whether the IU provision should have been more thoroughly — or publicly — vetted.
“You look at all the other things we did — I mean, they were up until two in the morning to get it done, and there was a lot of significant legislation that crossed the finish line,” the governor said. “You know why that happened? You can ask any legislator — even the ones that didn’t come along with us — this is the most anybody from the second floor has been dealing with the third floor in a long, long time.”
“I don’t know how much Mitch did it back then, but we were wearing (lawmakers) out in a good way. We were there talking to them,” Braun said, referring to former Gov. Mitch Daniels. “And I think that was welcomed. They’re going to have a partner on the second floor that’s interested in really working with them to take Indiana into places I think we can go that no one imagined before.”
How trustees are chosen
At present, all IU trustees serve three-year terms, except the student member whose term lasts just two years.
The new provisions shorten student terms to one year and sets a three-term limit on appointed board members.
No other university boards were altered by the latest budget language.
How trustees are selected at other Hoosier colleges and universities varies somewhat — but like IU, others have also traditionally allowed alumni to have a say on one or more members.
Quiet budget addition would give Braun full control over Indiana University Board of Trustees

At Purdue University, for example, three of the 10 board members are elected by the school’s alumni association, one of whom must be a graduate of the College of Agriculture. The governor appoints the remaining seven members, including a student trustee.
“When it comes to our flagship university, I wish it was paying more attention to what the other flagship university was doing,” Braun said, referring to Purdue University. “(Purdue) is giving Hoosiers real value by keeping tuition and room and board to where you can afford it. And even though some of our other universities have done it, that’s the only place that initiated it, and that was done many years ago.”
The governor said he wants “better value for Hoosier parents,” noting that only half of Indiana’s high school graduates go on to college, and many of those “don’t make it to the finish line.”
“They’ve lost time, and they’re taking debt along,” Braun said. “I think Indiana (University) needs to look at how they’re producing degrees that are more marketable, that they’re lined up with where the high-demand, high wages are in our own state economy, and start running (the school) in a way that’s more efficient.”

We are proud to support the bill, S.71 — the New England model, and encourage our lawmakers in the House to swiftly advance it as currently written to avoid subjecting local businesses to increased costs, vague language and profit-seeking lawsuits that not only stifle innovation, but prevent them from reaching their customers.Businesses and nonprofits want clear guidelines to ensure compliance with any new data privacy law. We shouldn’t make that harder than it needs to be. As amended and passed by the Senate, S.71 sets clear standards, definitions and guardrails for businesses to ensure consumers are empowered, even granting the option for Vermonters to opt out of certain types of data processing. Regional compatibility is critically important for our collective efforts to grow a 21st-century economy. Vermont can’t afford to be on an island. Fortunately, our senators agreed, and we are looking to our lawmakers in the House to follow suit.Much like privacy legislation already on the books in New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut, the New England model limits the collection of consumer data to what is “adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary” for the purposes disclosed to the consumer. This language is not only regionally compatible, but consistent with California and Europe as well. We owe it to Vermont’s businesses to ensure new privacy legislation does not impact their ability to remain regionally, if not globally, competitive. But make no mistake: under the New England model, businesses and nonprofits will still have the tools necessary to reach new customers, maintain regulars and otherwise thrive right here in the state. Digital advertising, custom online experiences, loyalty programs and other core components of modern marketing campaigns must remain intact — and affordable for smaller outfits. READ MORE





 


Final Reading: Vermont Senate passes pared-down data privacy bill  

by Habib Sabet 
March 27, 2025, 6:30 pmMarch 27, 2025, 6:30 pm 



At the end of the day, we have to strike a balance. The New England model sets responsible guardrails for data-driven commerce while empowering consumers and protecting Vermont’s operators from needless litigation. Between workforce shortages, rising cost of living, and taxes, keeping the lights on is hard enough. Vermont’s businesses and nonprofits deserve clear guidance, and a chance to compete. And as the smallest economy in the United States, I know we all share the goal of climbing up the rankings — not staying at the bottom. That will take a purposeful approach to policy making, including and especially on issues like data privacy. Last year, the Legislature tried to pass data privacy legislation that ultimately failed. We cannot afford to make the same mistake twice — let’s learn our lesson from 2024, and get behind the New England model for data privacy. We look forward to working with lawmakers in the statehouse to support this Senate-backed data privacy bill and send it to the governor’s desk. It’s imperative that the voices of businesses and nonprofits are heard loud and clear by the House this session. A-1 FlooringDriven MarketingVermont Canoe & KayakingKevin Smith SportsCreative Design Lavoie Construction, LLCHyperRelic Sports CardsStanislas Property ServicesFaradayMytiBlade Shumway Excavating & HardscapeScout Digital The Wilson House of East DorsetKS DecoratingRail City Plumbing and HeatingTim Scott Real EstateShawn Cheney Group, LLCTC’s LLCJess Driver PhotographySierra Environmental DrillingThe Pine Cone RestaurantFirst Response LaborTuttle’s Trucking & RecyclingSteven Wright – Jay Peak ResortBillings Farm & Museum Rail City Plumbing & Heating  Shumberries Liberty Hill FarmRead the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont businesses: Getting data privacy right.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 08:02:33.957945

Some criticize GA — often referred to as the hotel/motel program — for “warehousing” people without a long-term plan. Others argue it provides shelter to vulnerable individuals who would otherwise be on the streets, at risk of exposure. Some feel the eligibility is too lax, others too strict; that it spends too much, that it’s underfunded. For over two decades many of us in the fields of housing, homelessness and anti-poverty work have been pulled into a parade of task forces, advisory groups and councils charged with finding an elusive compromise. That tension provides context, but it’s not what we’re here to opine on. This session, a House committee is proposing another transformation of the polarizing GA program. It involves the state pulling back from its role as operator and providing block-grant funding to five designated community organizations. The legislation leaves much to be sorted out and creates yet another advisory group for that purpose. READ MORE





 


Plan would overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness, dissolving statewide motel program

There are pros and cons with a regional alternative to GA. But a few lines in H.91 would simultaneously eliminate a less-well-known program, the Housing Opportunity Grant Program. HOP is a high-performing program that provides the lion’s share of funding for community-based shelters and services for Vermonters experiencing homelessness. HOP funding keeps shelters open and staffed. It supports case managers working with people along a continuum from crisis, to emergency shelter, to permanent housing. HOP funding pays for security deposits and back rent to Vermont landlords to support tenancies. It’s the program that keeps Vermonters out of GA motels through effective eviction prevention programs. HOP also gets people out of GA motels and into community-based shelter apartments and permanent housing. Last year HOP funds assisted 39 non-profit organizations in Vermont, allowing them to shelter 3,200 Vermonters. It provided over $4 million in security deposits, back rent and rental assistance to stabilize 2,246 Vermont households who were homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness. HOP does all this and more which is why we are advocating for its preservation. We ask Vermonters — residents, legislators, landlords, partners — to look closely at this legislation which we feel has the potential to destabilize a network of high-performing shelters and services at a moment it needs to be strong. The chaotic federal landscape is not projected to make things easier for operators or to reduce the need for emergency shelters.We ask that people not paint with the same brush the GA program and the Housing Opportunity Program. We ask that a proven and high-performing HOP program be held harmless from the next experiment with re-envisioning General Assistance, and that the Legislature affirm and direct the State to uphold and support the State Office of Economic Opportunity and the important role they play in serving our most vulnerable neighbors. In recent testimony, we heard H.91 described as “bold.” Transitioning General Assistance from a centralized, state program to a regional model administered by select nonprofits might warrant the adjective “bold.” But attempting that while destabilizing Vermont’s existing shelters and services supported through the HOP program would, we believe, be reckless. We support the Legislature and our community partners in efforts to reimagine GA funding and how it is put to use. As service providers, we would like to be at that table. We support harnessing the full capacity of the state Departments of Health, Health Access, Mental Health, Disabilities Aging and Independent Living, and Corrections in creating meaningful, transformative support systems for our most vulnerable neighbors. The people we serve day in and day out with severe health issues, debilitating substance use disorders and chronic mental health issues have been pushed from other systems of care in the name of cost savings and driven into our shelters and motels. We further support the use of GA funds to bolster successful programs such as HOP and others that are helping Vermonters and are not fully funded. This type of action will truly help the most vulnerable in our communities and would be bold. H.91 as written is not bold, it is reckless. The HOP program must be removed from H.91’s concept for redesigning General Assistance. Signed, Angus Chaney, executive director, Homeless Prevention Center Jonathan Farrell, executive director, COTS Julie Bond, executive director, Good Samaritan Haven Kim Anetsberger, executive director, Lamoille Community House Libby Bennett, executive director, Groundworks Collaborative Michael Redmond, executive director, Upper Valley Haven Constance S.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After years of delay, Hoosiers and other state residents will need a Real ID to pass through airport security and enter federal government buildings starting on May 7. In Indiana, a black star cutout in the upper right-hand corner signifies if a driver’s license is Real ID compliant. 
The law establishing a Real ID passed in 2005, following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission to establish a national standard for government-issued identification, such as driver’s licenses.     

 
 
 
But implementation took longer than anticipated. Federal entities repeatedly extended the deadline for 14 years to give state motor vehicle departments time to comply, according to a 2022 NPR story.
An Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles spokesperson told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that Indiana started offering Real ID on Jan. 1, 2010. A recent CBS News analysis found that 81% of Indiana driver’s licenses are compliant — which the agency attributed to “slow and steady growth” over the years. 
“Since the introduction of Real ID, the BMV has adhered to all federal mandates regarding the documentation required to apply for a Real ID credential,” said Sarah Dickerson, a communications and engagement manager, in a statement. “We encourage Hoosiers who are interested to reference the Real ID Checklist on our website, since many specific documents are needed.”
Such documentation includes the following: proof of identity, proof of name or gender changes, proof of lawful status, proof of social security and proof of Indiana residency. 
As detailed in a BMV list, this can include multiple other forms of identity, such as an unexpired U.S. passport, original birth certificate, social security cards, certificate of naturalization and more.  
 Difficulties rolling out Real IDs

The requirements can be challenging for some to meet. For instance, a W-2 form can be proof of Indiana residency — but only if it includes the full, nine-digit social security number and not only the last four digits. 
Married women or those who changed their name for another reason face another hurdle, especially those who married decades ago and must produce their original marriage certificate to prove their name change. 
Dorothy Ballone, who changed her name seven decades ago, had her Real ID application rejected when she couldn’t produce her original marriage certificate, she told a Rochester, New York TV station. 
Neither the church where she got married nor the town hall kept records that far back.

The rule also impacts those who transitioned to another gender, adoptees or couples who choose to hyphenate their last names. 
The BMV documentation checklist includes a caveat at the bottom specifically for Hoosiers who fall into this category. 
“If your current name does not match your identity document due to a name change … you may need to provide additional government-issued documents to support any or all name changes,” according to the footnote. “For example, if you were born Jane Smith and then married Tom Cooper and your legal name is not Jane Cooper, you will need to bring your marriage license.”
Having a valid passport with your changed name would also meet the requirement. 
Dickerson, with the BMV, urged Hoosiers in this category to work with their local branch to meet documentation requirements.
“Customers with complex situations face challenges similar to those they’ve had for years. This is seen more frequently with married women and those going through a divorce,” said Dickerson. “Our branch staff are well-trained and skilled in completing Real ID transactions. Often, if a customer doesn’t have all the proper documents, a staff member will explain what is needed to ensure they are able to complete the transaction next time.”

(Photo via Florida State Archives)When I was a kid growing up in Pensacola, I’d come home from school and immediately turn on “The Big Show” on WKRG-TV. The avuncular host, Max Goodman, showed a lot of ’50s monster movies, and that’s where I learned about the transformative power of radioactivity.
Those movies taught me that radiation can make a normal-sized octopus into a sucker-armed giant (“It Came from Beneath the Sea,” 1955). It can turn a lot of little ants into a really big insect army (“Them!” 1954). It can even make an average guy grow into the tallest, strongest man on earth (“The Amazing Colossal Man,” 1957)!
So you can imagine how happy I was to hear about Senate Bill 832. This bill will make it far more likely that Central Florida’s new residents wind up living on top of radioactive waste that will turn them and their household insects colossal.
Picture how big the flying cockroaches will get. Won’t that be fun?
Members of the Florida Senate and House sure seem to think so. The Senate voted 33-3 to approve the bill two weeks ago. Then the House voted 80-20 to pass it last week. However, the House version differs from what passed the Senate and, as of Wednesday afternoon, the Senate had rejected the House version and sent it back to the lower chamber.
Perhaps, on this return trip, someone will ask them what the heck they think they’re doing.
  Sen. Danny Burgess via X
My colleague Mitch Perry wrote about this bill for the Florida Phoenix in March, when the bill, sponsored by Sen. Danny Burgess passed the Senate Judiciary Committee. He reported that it “would provide new legal protections to companies that mine phosphate in Florida and leave behind radioactive spoils.”
Yeah, the largest phosphate company in the world, Tampa-based Mosaic, needs protection from being sued. From what I’ve seen, Mosaic needs protection about as much as the Amazing Colossal Man did.

I first heard about this bizarre bill’s impending passage from Glenn Compton of the venerable environmental group ManaSota-88.
“It’s not a good idea to have residents living on top of this,” he told me. “It’s not a good idea to build houses on these properties.”
Yet we’ve built thousands of them.
Some people contend that being exposed to radiation is not the magical shortcut to greater size and strength that those ’50s movies led me to believe. In fact, it’s actually bad, because it causes cancer.
That’s the argument of the attorneys suing Mosaic on behalf of some Mulberry homeowners. Their mobile homes in Anglers Green and the ironically named Paradise Lakes sit on land where Mosaic once mined, then piled the dirt back on top when they were done.
Because no one warned them, the buyers of these lots had no idea it was polluted property when they sank their money into it, the suit says. Then family members fell ill.
“The ground and soil that support and form the very foundation upon which [the plaintiffs’] homes sit is contaminated with uranium and radium-226 caused by Mosaic’s phosphate mining operations,” the 2020 lawsuit says.
For years, Mosaic has been all over TV with ads bragging about their commitment to Florida’s environment. Meanwhile, though, the company has been leaving cancer-causing contaminants behind on the land that’s been mined and then “reclaimed”.
Mosaic digs deep into the ground for the phosphate rocks that it needs, exposing radioactive soils that had been hidden 20 or more feet below the surface. Humans were safe from the radiation while the soil was buried. But when Mosaic covers the holes back up to sell to developers, the radioactive material winds up on the surface.
“Exposure to levels of radiation similar to those identified in the Angler’s Green and Paradise Lakes communities,” the suit contends, “translates to residents receiving over one chest X-ray per week — with obviously no diagnostic or health purpose whatsoever.”
  Ryan Ellis via law firm
  Chris Nidel via law firm
I talked to two of the attorneys representing the homeowners, Ryan Ellis and Chris Nidel. They told me that Burgess’ phosphate bill is clearly aimed at protecting Mosaic from their lawsuit, which has so far survived all the company’s efforts to persuade a judge dismiss it.
“It’s just hurdle after hurdle to prevent them from being sued,” Nidel told me. If it passes, “Mosaic is in the end zone about to declare victory.”
This affects more than just their clients, the attorneys told me. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found widespread Central Florida development atop old phosphate mine locations.
“They found 50,000 people living on these sites,” Nidel told me. “There’s acres and acres of them.”
He mentioned that one former mine was disguised as a park for riding mountain bikes. “They’re radioactive waste pits and now people are riding around in them.”
 Something the Legislature should know
The Mulberry homeowners weren’t the first to sue over their contaminated land. In 2017, residents of Lakeland’s Oakbridge and Grasslands communities sued the developer who built their homes on top of old mining properties.
They settled the suit last year but, in announcing the settlement, their law firm pointed out, “EPA testing before development of the subdivisions showed radiation levels 11 to 21 times higher than the acceptable risk limit.” The builder went ahead anyway.
I heard about that 2017 case from Rachael Curran of the Jacobs Public Interest Law Clinic for Democracy and the Environment at Stetson University’s College of Law.
  Rachael Curran via Stetson Law School
“I have no idea how many homes are presently built [or] planned to be built on reclaimed lands in Florida,” Curran told me. “That’s something the Legislature should know before it limits recoverable damages for these exposed Floridians.”
But our fine lawmakers aren’t interested in those kinds of numbers. They only care about the numbers on Mosaic’s campaign contributions.
Independent journalist Jason Garcia, who wrote about this bill in February, noted that Mosaic has hired half a dozen lobbyists to push Burgess’ bill.
He also pointed out that “Mosaic has been cutting large checks to key lawmakers this month — including a $10,000 donation to Burgess that was deposited four days before the senator filed his bill to help Mosaic.”
In defending his bill before the Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee last month, Burgess called it “a necessary piece of legislation, with a naturally occurring geological feature in the state of Florida.”
Not a single senator voted against it.
 Playing havoc with ecosystems
The quest for phosphate rock didn’t start with Mosaic. Miners seeking the ancient rock used for making fertilizer have been ripping up the Florida landscape for more than a century.
  Albertus Vogt via Find A Grave website
In 1889, a man named Albertus Vogt — a onetime Confederate soldier with an impressive mustache and a curious marital history — noticed, in a spring near Dunnellon, some prehistoric fossils.
Vogt recalled similar fossils turning up near phosphate deposits in South Carolina and hired someone to dig. Sure enough, the Florida fossils turned out to be a sign of extensive phosphate, the remnants of prehistoric animals.
What happened next was like the California gold rush, but without the frequent gunplay, the Mark Twain stories, and, of course, the bullion.
“News of this great find spread,” the Phosphate Research Institute reports. “Thousands of prospectors and speculators flooded the area and the great Florida phosphate boom had begun. By 1894 more than 215 phosphate mining companies were operating statewide.”
Now there are 28 phosphate mines in Florida, covering more than 450,000 acres, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. Eleven phosphate mines are currently active, and a series of corporate mergers have led to Mosaic becoming nearly the last miner standing.
Drive through the part of Central Florida known as Bone Valley and you’ll see the strange creations that mark the location of the mines and processing plants: Massive mounds of waste known as phosphogypsum stacks, often the highest point for miles around. Each one has a huge pond of acidic water pooled on top.
The other thing that marks these industrial sites: a series of disasters that have plagued the industry and repeatedly played havoc with our ecosystems.
In 1994, a sinkhole opened up beneath a stack in Mulberry that was so big, local wags later dubbed it the new Disney World ride, “Journey to the Center of the Earth.” The hole measured 160 feet across and about 400 feet deep and its sudden appearance dropped at least 2 million gallons of acidic wastewater down into the Floridan Aquifer.
In 1997 a dam atop a gypsum stack at a Mulberry Phosphates fertilizer plant broke during heavy rains, spilling 56 million gallons of acidic wastewater into the Alafia River. As the pollution flowed downriver, everything in the 42 miles between Mulberry and Tampa Bay was killed, including more than 1 million fish. The company declared bankruptcy and shut down.
Seven years later, in 2004, something similar happened. Tropical Storm Frances broke the dam atop a gypsum stack at Mosaic’s Riverview plant, sending 65 million gallons of the acidic waste into a creek that flowed into Hillsborough Bay. The pollution killed fish, mangroves, and seagrass.
Then, in 2016, less than 2 miles from where the 1994 sinkhole occurred, another sinkhole opened beneath a Mosaic gypsum stack. This hole wound up being 45 feet wide and 220 feet deep. Down went 215 million gallons of acidic water, gurgling into the aquifer that supplies the region’s drinking supply.
And I haven’t even mentioned Mosaic’s $2 billion settlement with the EPA, which a government spokesman called “the most significant enforcement action in the mining and mineral processing arena” in the U.S.
Or the horrific Piney Point disaster, which resulted from Florida environmental regulators repeatedly bending the rules to accommodate industry.

 Save Mosaic!
Yet our legislators treat the phosphate industry like it’s a miner celebrity (ba-dum-bum!), not a major polluter.
I picture them wandering the marble halls of the Capitol like that misinformed high school kid in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” who was carrying a Pepsi can full of change and calling out “Save Ferris!” Instead, they’re chanting, “Save Mosaic!” and collecting legislation to help the company succeed.
The company wants to use its radioactive waste to build roads? Sure, no problem! Happy to help!
How about we also spend $20 million of taxpayer dollars to research using those gypsum stacks as a source of rare earth metals? Sure, no sweat!
And now they’re ready to build a wall around Mosaic’s bank account so not a single cancer-stricken mobile home resident can get at it.
But it’s not just the trailer park folks who’d be blocked from getting any of Mosaic’s moolah.
In 2013, Mosaic took one of its Polk County phosphate mines that had played out in the 1960s and converted it into a 36-hole golf resort called “Streamsong.” Two years ago, the company sold Streamsong to a Chicago sports management business for $160 million.
I sure hope they warn all the golfers to wear hazmat suits when they tee off.
 The backup plan
I tried repeatedly to get Mosaic officials to comment on their use of the Legislature to make an end-run around their losing battle in the courts.
For some reason, they were too busy to respond my questions. Perhaps they were preparing medical bills to send to those lucky Mulberry mobile homeowners getting all the free X-rays.
Meanwhile, fearing the Burgess bill might not make it across the finish line before the legislative session ended, the Florida Senate came up with a backup plan.
The pertinent content of the “Save Mosaic” bill was added as an amendment to SB 492, which has to do with wetlands destruction, which is also something Mosaic is good at. It has passed both the House and Senate unanimously.
Because they’ve doubled the company’s chances of success, it’s likely one of these bills makes into law. That would end any further legal challenge to Mosaic’s failure to clean up its mess
According to those ’50s movies, that means we should look for a lot of colossal basketball and football players coming from the high schools built on top of the formerly mined lands. Buying their clothes could be tricky. I’d recommend investing heavily in Spandex.
If you’re considering buying any Bone Valley property, you should definitely ask your realtor if it used to be at the bottom of a ginormous phosphate mine.
And if you know anyone who’s just purchased a home there, remember that the best housewarming gift is probably a Geiger counter.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.



Federal education cuts and Trump DEI demands leave states, teachers in limbo  




In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
 ‘It’s the system that needs fixing’

Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version focused on the science of reading passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill into law Monday to outlaw three-cueing.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”



Debate over holding back third graders roils state legislatures 




Sen. Kemp’s bill requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
 Opposition to ‘science of reading’

Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.



A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz and the Legislature are busy working on the state’s budget for the next two years. 
Their efforts to reduce state spending, however, are focused on two other realities: the state budget deficit forecast in 2028-29, and what is happening in Washington, D.C. 
The chaos in Washington is the bigger wild card. 
The actions of the Trump administration create two problems for the state budget. First, an increased risk of a recession. And, second, direct cuts of federal funds to the state.  
The funding cuts have already started, with reductions impacting public health, behavioral health, food shelves, transportation, housing projects and more. 
Whether it’s DOGE or Congress, there is no sign the cutting will stop any time soon. 
The biggest budgetary threat for Minnesota — and most states — is cuts to federal Medicaid spending. 
The U.S. House budget plan proposes to reduce funding for Medicare and Medicaid by $880 billion over the next ten years. Most observers expect Medicare will be held harmless and the bulk of the cuts will come from Medicaid. 
Medicaid, called Medical Assistance in Minnesota, serves about 1.3 million Minnesotans. It provides health coverage to low-income families and individuals, and long-term care for seniors and people with disabilities. 
Minnesota spent $18.5 billion on Medical Assistance in fiscal year 2024. Sixty percent of that funding — $11.1 billion — came from the federal government. 
Medical Assistance is the largest program in the state budget, and it is growing fast: Due to the rising cost of health care and the aging of the population, spending will exceed $26 billion in fiscal year 2029 — a 42% increase over five years according to the Department of Human Services. If the $880 billion federal reduction is spread proportionately across all states, DHS estimates Minnesota would lose about $1.4 to $1.6 billion per year in federal Medicaid funding. 
The actual impact depends on what policy changes Congress adopts. 
One of the most likely changes is adding work requirements for some Medicaid enrollees. Work requirements are a bad idea for a variety of reasons, as nicely summarized in this space a few weeks ago. 
It’s a bad policy, and it also doesn’t save a lot for the federal budget. A similar proposal in 2017 was estimated to save $109 billion over ten years, only a fraction of the $880 billion Congress is now pursuing. 
It’s not clear where Congress will look for additional Medicaid savings, but targeting the expansion population — a new group of people that were added to Medicaid coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act — is a definite possibility. 
The “expansion population,” as it is called, consists of adults without children. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, which enacted the Medicaid expansion, health coverage for these low-income adults was a significant gap in our nation’s health care system. Some states — including Minnesota — cobbled together some basic coverage, but it is difficult for a state to provide broad access to health care coverage without federal funding.

Dismantling a part of the ACA — aka, Obamacare — may be politically appealing to the GOP-controlled Congress. There would also be no impact on the 10 states that do not cover the expansion group — nine of which are solidly Republican, including Florida and Texas. 
KFF, an independent source for health care research and news, says one prominent proposal is to end the enhanced 90% federal funding match for the expansion population. States could continue to serve the expansion population but would get their normal rate of federal reimbursement.  
That normal match rate for Medicaid is called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP. These rates vary by state based on per capita income, ranging from 50% to 77%. Minnesota’s current FMAP is 51.16%.
If all states continued to cover the expansion population at the lower rate, KFF estimates the federal government would save $656 billion over the ten-year horizon.
But it is likely many — probably most — states would discontinue Medicaid coverage for the expansion group because they could not afford to make up the lost federal funding. 
It would cost Minnesota about $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2026 to continue covering the adults without kids expansion group. It is hard to see how the state could afford $1.2 billion a year under normal budget conditions, much less with the looming deficit and the threat of a recession. 
In Minnesota, 230,000 people would lose coverage. 
This population is one of the most marginalized groups in our society. Access to Medicaid has been particularly helpful in providing better access to mental health and substance use services.  
If this coverage goes away, it puts pressure on counties and underfunded community resources; many people will simply lose access to health care and behavioral health services. Uncompensated care — when people without insurance receive care in an emergency room, for instance — would increase, impacting community hospitals and shifting costs onto people who have insurance. 
The need for health care doesn’t go away — it just gets delayed, more serious and shifted to other budgets. 
Federal funding cuts across the state budget will force hard choices. The usual default is to say that the state can’t plug holes from federal cuts. 
And you can’t plug all the holes. But if the cuts are deep and broad, the state may need to reprioritize its own funds to fill the most crucial gaps. 
In this instance, recreating full Medicaid coverage is probably fiscally impossible. Some cobbled together gap filler, maybe. 
Progress is not a straight line going up — it is often two steps forward and one step back. 
But this would be a deeply harmful step back.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Sponsored by state Sen. Ben Brown, a Republican from Washington, the bill would prohibit public and charter schools from banning homeschooled or full-time virtual students from taking part in school athletics and activities.
A similar bill proposed by Brown in the last session stalled in the House. This year, Brown’s bill passed unanimously out of the Senate and passed the House Wednesday on a 91-53 vote.
Because the House made minor changes, it will return to the Senate for a final vote. Brown said he anticipates the bill will pass should it be taken up by the full Senate. The legislative session adjourns May 16.
State law allows public school districts to ban or restrict the participation of homeschoolers in athletics. The policy of the Missouri State High School Activities Association, which many schools follow, is to allow homeschoolers to participate in sports if they are enrolled in one credit hour of coursework at a public school.
State Rep. Ben Baker, a Republican from Neosho, said the bill “ensures that every child has access to opportunities that add to and foster their academic, social and personal growth.”
Baker, whose children have been homeschooled, argued that homeschoolers’ parents who pay taxes should be able to send their children to programs in publicly funded schools.
State Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, a Democrat from Columbia and former teacher, said she was sympathetic to the bill’s intent, but expressed concerns that the passage could lead to an unfunded mandate.
State funding for education is partially determined by the level of enrollment in a school. Steinhoff’s concern is that potential homeschoolers who take part in public school programs or utilize school resources would not be considered in enrollment counts.
“(Schools) will not be getting state money to support these students participating in these activities,” Steinhoff said.
Baker said the strain brought by increased participation would likely be minimal, as few homeschoolers would be likely to participate in each school.
Several Democrats also expressed concerns that the bill could be unfair to public school students as homeschoolers may not have to meet the same standards as public school students. Steinhoff pointed specifically to grade and attendance requirements for some athletic programs in schools.
“There’s also some requirements and conditions in accessing the privileges provided by our schools,” Steinhoff said. “Often you have to keep your grades up, you have to keep your attendance up, you have to maintain positive relationships with peers and adults.”
Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, spoke to the long history of this legislation, beginning with its first proposal in 2014 by former House Speaker Elijah Haahr. Deaton, along with other legislators, have taken up the bill unsuccessfully since then.
Deaton also pointed out a provision of the bill which allows schools to require homeschoolers to attend courses, rehearsals or practices related to their participation in school activities.
“For example, if you’re going to be involved in a band, and there’s a band class directly related to that, you absolutely should have to play in that band class,” Deaton said.
Another concern, voiced by Rep. Michael Burton, a Democrat from Lakeshire, involved vaccine requirements.
Missouri public school students are required to have several vaccines to attend school. Burton said he worries that unvaccinated homeschoolers participating in school activities could put public school students at risk.

(Preston Keres | USDA)In the first months of the administration of President Donald Trump, organizations working to keep Wisconsin’s environment healthy have seen cuts to key grant programs. Now they are watching for  Trump’s retreat from environmental protection to hit communities across the state. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it was cancelling the Climate Smart Commodities Program — a $3 billion effort to fund projects across the country to improve soil health, sequester carbon, reduce methane emissions and encourage other climate-friendly farming practices. 
Trump administration officials called the program a “Biden era slush fund,” saying that not enough of the money went directly to farmers. The USDA cancelled projects that did not meet three criteria: a minimum of 65% of funds needed to be going directly to producers, grants must have had one producer enrolled by the end of 2024 and at least one payment must have been made to a producer by the end of 2024. 
“The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative was largely built to advance the green new scam at the benefit of NGOs, not American farmers,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement. “The concerns of farmers took a backseat during the Biden Administration. During my short time as Secretary, I have heard directly from our farmers that many of the USDA partnerships are overburdened by red tape, have ambiguous goals, and require complex reporting that push farmers onto the sidelines. We are correcting these mistakes and redirecting our efforts to set our farmers up for an unprecedented era of prosperity.”
A USDA fact sheet published last year states that 28 Wisconsin-based projects were funded by the program. One of the organizations receiving funding was the Fox-Wolf Watershed Alliance, which has worked to protect the Fox and Wolf Rivers — which are connected to Lake Michigan — for more than three decades in the region of the state most densely occupied by industrial agriculture operations. 
On April 22, the Alliance received an official termination notice for two grants it had received through the program to share costs with farmers to institute practices such as cover cropping and no-till planting, according to a statement from the alliance. Both practices help farmers maintain soil health and prevent potentially harmful nutrients such as phosphorus from running off fields and into the local water system. 
The grant funding also supported 10 technical support jobs at county land and water departments, Pheasants Forever and the Wisconsin Farmers Union. The loss of the money has resulted in the cancellation of 37 contracts with farmers, 4,000 acres of planned no-till planting going unfunded and, this fall, 16,000 acres of farmland that may not have cover crops planted. 
In its statement, the Alliance said that government support for programs like these is an investment that helps farmers long term, even if some of the money doesn’t go directly into their hands. 
“We fully support the goal of directing more resources to farmers. In fact, we design our programs with low overhead to ensure dollars go where they matter most,” the Alliance stated. “However, the review process did not account for one important factor: technical assistance is direct farmer support.” 
Just because the money doesn’t go straight to the farmers doesn’t mean they don’t benefit, according to the Alliance.
“Farmers often pay out-of-pocket for the kind of expertise our technical staff provide — support that is essential to the success and longevity of conservation practices,” the statement continued. “Excluding this from the ‘producer-directed’ category overlooks the real-world value of those services. Without that guidance, funding becomes a one-time transaction instead of a long-term investment. Fox-Wolf’s model is built not just on providing financial support, but on ensuring that practices are implemented effectively and sustained over time. That’s what makes our work effective — and why this funding mattered.” 
Jessica Schultz, the Alliance’s executive director, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the goal of the grants was to help the region’s farmers transition to these soil-friendly practices beyond just one season, allowing the organization to help protect the watershed, which is suffering from “excess phosphorus and sediment loading,” in the long term. 
“These practices also improve soil health, but transitioning to a continuous cover system requires a new approach to farm management. This shift can result in short-term yield losses or necessitate investment in new equipment,” Schultz said. “The cost-share provided through our grants would have played a vital role in helping farmers overcome these initial barriers. However, to realize lasting water quality improvements in our rivers and lakes, these conservation practices must be adopted consistently — not just for a single season, but year after year — across the majority of farmland in the basin.”
“The technical assistance offered through our projects was intended to support farmers through this transition, providing both expertise and access to equipment from across the region,” she continued. “Our goal was to foster long-term adoption by equipping producers with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed — not just for one growing season, but for the future health of our local waterways.” 
Climate and sustainability grants worth $100K canceled
The Fox-Wolf Watershed Alliance isn’t the only organization that has lost grant funding since Trump’s inauguration. Wisconsin Green Fire has already had two grants, totaling nearly $100,000, canceled, according to Meleesa Johnson, the organization’s executive director. 
The first grant, worth about $32,000, was aimed at working with the Wisconsin Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy to develop resources for local governments seeking to implement climate change mitigation strategies such as improving stormwater management and planting more trees to reduce heat island effects. The second grant was a $65,000 contract with the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service to establish a farm sustainability rewards program. Similar to the alliance’s grant, that program would have given farmers money in exchange for implementing practices such as no-till planting or reducing the use of nitrogen. 
Green Fire had already spent money on getting the farm sustainability program off the ground, and now, according to Johnson, it’s unclear if the organization will be reimbursed. 
“We’re not the only ones,” she said. “There’s a lot of groups out there that have been moving along, doing the work, meeting the benchmarks of contract expectations, and now, well, many of us are, most of us are not being paid for the work that we’ve all begun. So it’s hard. It’s not impossible for organizations to regroup, but it just makes it more difficult.”
Johnson said that this program was about getting money directly to farmers — even if the program’s description used the word “carbon.” 
“First and foremost, this was about getting money into the hands of farmers either already deploying good conservation practices or wanting to, [who] didn’t have the resources to do it,” she said. “This wasn’t about Green Fire. This was about farmers, and we were just developing the metric and the strategies to make sure that high performing farms with good conservation practices were being rewarded for doing really, really good work.” 
Without programs like these, Johnson said, Wisconsin will continue to “see that continual slow degradation of farm fields and water quality.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cattle-Iowa__USDA-photo.jpg,,,2025-05-01 07:00:54.357268

In interviews this month, officials with the Idaho School Boards Association, the Idaho Education Association, a member of the Madison School District Board of Trustees and the superintendent of the Post Falls School District said they are frustrated with the new fiscal year 2026 public school budgets. They said the public schools budget provides no new additional state funding for anything other than pay increases and benefits for school staff.
Meanwhile, a key state legislator said the Idaho Legislature chose to focus on funding school facilities and reducing taxes.

The education officials say they appreciate the increased state funding to provide raises and benefits for teachers, school administrators and other school staffers who do not hold teaching certificates. But the school officials noted the Idaho Legislature provided additional funding for all state employees in all agencies and departments to receive pay raises.
Meanwhile, there is no additional new funding in the public school budgets for special education programs, classroom upgrades, technology, extra curricular programs or operations funding.

“Excepting the Luna laws budget that we had, this is the worst year for public schools from the state Legislature that I can remember,” Madison School District school board chair Brian Pyper said in a phone interview Friday.
Pyper was referring to a trio of education laws passed in 2011 that were named for former Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Luna. Idaho voters repealed the Luna laws at the polls in the November 2012 general election.
Post Falls School District Superintendent Dena Naccarato agreed.
“In my opinion, it’s the worst legislative session in my time in Idaho, and I’ve been an educator for 31 years,” Naccarato said in a phone interview Wednesday. 
 Calls to change Idaho’s school funding formula intensify 

Naccarato said one of the biggest problems is the public school funding formula that funds education based on an attendance calculation, not enrollment. Post Falls is the 11th largest school district in Idaho, and attendance averages about 92.6% of enrollment. 
Because of that, Naccarato said her district takes a 7.4% hit on operations funding – the difference between 92.6% attendance versus the 100% enrollment number. 
If 7% of the students are absent, Naccarato said that doesn’t mean she can turn down the heat by 7% or send 7% of the district’s teachers home without pay.  
Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield praised the Idaho Legislature for providing additional money for salaries and benefits this year.
But Critchfield said districts depend on operations funding. Critchfield also called for Idaho to change its funding mechanism for public schools.
“Clearly, I believe the time to address the overall limitations of the current funding mechanism is past due, and that need was reiterated in the Legislature’s most recent Office of Performance Evaluations report,” Critchfield said in a written statement Tuesday. “A longterm fix of how we distribute funding and effectively use the money we have must be on the table.”
 JFAC co-chair says Idaho legislators are focusing on tax cuts and payments for school facilities. Meanwhile, school enrollment is down. 

Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, said the Idaho Legislature actually provided $400 million in new funding for public education this year, just in different places outside the school budget.
Horman wrote a column earlier this month praising the Idaho Legislature’s budget process and highlighting a $400 million increase for public schools. 
  Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, speaks from the House floor on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun on Monday, Horman said the money is located outside of the public school budgets –  in tax cuts and in facilities payments to school districts that are used to pay down supplemental levies and bond issues for school facilities.
“If you’re only looking at the general fund, yeah, there’s $97.7 million, but that’s not all we gave to public schools – not by a long shot,” Horman said Monday. 
Horman said she has consistently pushed for $100 million-plus increases in public school funding over a decade of working on public school budgets in the Idaho Legislature. 
“(The public schools budget) has doubled in the time I’ve been on JFAC – It’s gone from $1.4 billion to $ 2.8 billion, plus this year,” Horman said. 
“We have been exceedingly responsive to the school districts when they have told us where they need the funds – that’s where we’ve put them,” Horman said. “But you can’t look at any one year in isolation. You have to look at the context. We focused on insurance. We focused on salaries. Now, the last couple of years, we’ve been focusing on facilities because that’s what people told us they needed.”
 Idaho Legislature’s budget committee co-chairwoman says state lawmakers have shifted funding priorities

Horman acknowledged school leaders may be feeling a pinch with the budget this year. But she said it is not because the Idaho Legislature is short-changing schools.

Horman said other factors are also at play, such as a decrease in public school students and changes in the types of students in Idaho. The Idaho Legislature has also chosen to shift its funding priorities to pay for salary increases for educators, funding for school facilities, paying down school levies and bond issues and lowering taxes, she said.
Horman cited budget documents prepared by the Idaho Legislative Services Office as the source for her $400 million claim. The documents list:

$97.8 million increase in state general fund spending on public schools.
$246 million in school facilities payments through a combination of House Bill 304, a property tax relief bill from this year’s legislative session, House Bill 521 from the 2024 legislative session and House Bill 292 from the 2023 legislative session.
$50 million from House Bill 338 from the 2025 legislative session for the Public School Facilities Cooperative Fund.
$5 million from Senate Bill 1069 from the 2025 legislative session for literacy professional development and curriculum. 

Horman also said she has fought to change the public school funding formula for 10 years and favors giving school boards discretion over spending. This year, Horman sponsored House Bill 279, an unsuccessful bill that sought to move Idaho to a per-student funding model based on attendance. 
 Why are education groups concerned with the Idaho public school budgets? 

Idaho School Boards Association Deputy Director Quinn Perry said school board members have been asking about Horman’s column and questioning if the budget increase adds up.
“Our members are asking questions based on what they read from policy makers, and they are asking, ‘where did it increase that much?’” Perry said in a phone interview. “We are having to over-explain in our breakdown of the budget why that is not new money and why it can’t go into operations. It’s specifically for facilities infrastructure.”
Pyper said the facilities money is valuable, but districts don’t have any flexibility in spending it. The facilities money is being used to reduce tax rates or pay off debt that voters agreed to when  they passed a school bond to finance large long-term projects, such as the construction of new school buildings or roof repairs.
“I recognize that has been allocated to help school districts pay off bonds and levies but that’s all it can be used for,” Pyper said. “If we have levies or bonds, it goes to that and not operations. So that’s when we have to get creative or shuffle money around from other places.”
Another concern is that charter schools, which are public schools in Idaho, are not able to access the facilities funding because they cannot run school bonds or levies, Perry said.
 What about discretionary spending for Idaho’s public school districts?

Perry and Pyper said they have big two concerns with the new public schools budget the Idaho Legislature set.
First, there is an overall decrease in the amount of discretionary funding that public schools receive.

The money is called discretionary spending because school leaders have flexibility in how they spend it on local needs and priorities.
Critchfield, Idaho’s superintendent of public instruction, said discretionary funding is crucial for local school districts. Education officials and superintendents often use the terms “discretionary funding” and “operations funding” interchangeably.
“A priority area of a local school budget is always operational dollars, which provide the greatest ability to address local needs due to their flexibility,” Critchfield said Tuesday. “Without an inflation-related adjustment in operational funding, districts will continue to pay for things like special education, fuel and utilities with discretionary dollars that have remained flat.”
Pyper, from the Madison School Board, said the decrease in discretionary/operations funding could force school districts to be creative financially or consider supplemental levies to pay for unexpected expenses, enhancements or any new programs.
“We have huge uncertainty with all the tariffs, and we are still looking at 6-to-7% inflation,” Pyper said.  
Horman, the legislator who co-chairs the budget committee, said discretionary spending is going down because of a decrease in Idaho students and changes to the types of students. 
One of the calculations driving Idaho’s public school budget is the number of support units in the budget. For budget purposes, one support unit is basically the equivalent of one school classroom. Because there is a decrease in the number of public school students in Idaho, the number of support units the state’s public school budget is built around decreased, which led to a decrease in the amount of discretionary spending for public schools.

“Discretionary funding impacts local taxpayers the most because patrons are often asked to supplement the variable costs of educating their students and running their local schools,” Critchfield said. “Statewide enrollment has experienced slight changes the last several years, but the cost of running a school district continues to increase.”
 New evaluation report highlights special education funding gap in Idaho 

Perry and Pyper also said the state is underfunding special education and special needs students. 
This year, the Idaho Legislature did not provide any additional money to bridge an $82.2 million special education funding gap that the nonpartisan Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations highlighted in a March report. 
House Bill 291 would have created a new $3 million state fund to help high-needs students with disabilities. Horman voted for it, but when House Bill 291 reached the Idaho Senate, senators killed it by a single vote.
“The Legislature’s own report showed they are underfunding special needs by about $85 million across the state and they refused to provide us a $3 million stopgap to address critical needs, saying the money is sufficient when their own report says it is not,” Pyper said. 
Naccarato, the superintendent of the Post Falls School District, said her district receives about $5.6 million in state and federal funding for special education, but it spent about $8.2 million because the number of special education students is increasing. Naccarato said there is a $2.6 million gap that she has to make up with money from elsewhere. 
“My discretionary budget is fake news,” Neccarato said. “It’s not discretionary, it’s operations funding because the legislative body continues to do nothing to support public education in the 21st century.”  
Naccarato said the Post Falls School District is seeking a supplemental levy in the upcoming May 20 election. She said the district is seeking the levy due to funding gaps Naccarato blames the Idaho Legislature for, as well as a desire to pay staff more than what the Idaho Legislature provides. 
“Most school districts in Idaho have to rely on supplemental levies for operations costs,” Naccarato said, adding that is why she calls them fundamental levies, not supplemental levies. 
 Idaho Legislature approved tax credits for tuition at private schools this year 

Along with concerns about the state’s public school budget, many of the education officials interviewed in this article are concerned about House Bill 93, a new law co-sponsored by Horman that provides a refundable tax credit to Idaho families for education expenses, including tuition at private religious schools.
“There is a definite hesitation this year on the back of HB 93 where the big fear among school board leaders is their needs will be overshadowed,” Perry said. 
Horman disagreed and said House Bill 93 did not take money from the public school budget and is a separate program and initiative. 
“As I explained on the (House) floor multiple times, they are unrelated,” Horman said.




 Behind the numbers: enrollment and school funding 

The first spreadsheet posted below this box shows 10 years’ worth of enrollment data at Idaho public schools. Total enrollment this school year is down by almost 500 students compared to last year.
The second document shows how support units are calculated in public school budgets. For budget purposes, a support unit is roughly equivalent to one Idaho school classroom.
The documents were provided by Horman via the Idaho Legislative Services Office.

Though the islands are interested in Wyoming coal, deals might not come in time to help beleaguered Kemmerer coal mine, Gordon said.
The post Governor: Trade mission to Japan, Taiwan could increase Wyoming fossil fuel exports appeared first on WyoFile .","Gov. Mark Gordon recently joined several Wyoming business proprietors at a trade show in Taiwan, where Casper-based Backwards Distilling Company and Gillette-based Big Lost Meadery are highly regarded and very popular, he said. But the popularity of Wyoming spirits wasn’t the main thrust of the visit.
In both Taiwan and Japan, Gordon and other Wyoming dignitaries visited with business and ministry officials who are interested in Wyoming’s coal and natural gas, as well as strengthening partnerships to push carbon capture technologies to help those fossil fuels fit within their low-carbon-emission goals.
Both potential markets rely heavily on energy fuel imports, Gordon said, while officials in Taiwan believe that “about 20% of their energy mix is going to remain with coal and they’re very anxious to get Powder River coal.”
Taiwan has its own elected government, but the People’s Republic of China claims it has sovereignty over the island off its coast.

Gordon called a press conference Wednesday to highlight his trade mission to the region earlier this month. He was joined by officials from the University of Wyoming, Wyoming Energy Authority as well as representatives from energy producers Jonah Energy, Williams Companies and coal-to-products company Kanata Clean Power & Climate Technologies Corp.
“It builds confidence, which is very important in Asia,” Gordon said of the international talks. “And so this leads us to believe that there is a lot of very exciting opportunity.”
One primary tangible outcome Gordon hopes to come of strengthening ties with the two foreign markets is to reinvigorate efforts to build coal and natural gas port terminals to increase the international export of those Wyoming commodities. While the U.S. has increased its capacity to export liquified natural gas, efforts to expand coal ports, particularly on the West Coast, have faltered for years.
But Gordon believes that with public-private investment, along with policy support from President Donald Trump, those efforts will be revitalized.
It will require “looking at whether the Millennium Bulk Terminal can be reinvigorated, or Jordan Cove [terminal] or whether a couple of these other things in Oakland that have been talked about from time to time could come to fruition,” Gordon said. Increasing Wyoming’s fossil fuel exports might also require “going out of the Gulf of America [Gulf of Mexico] and going through the Panama Canal,” he added.

Asked whether the state’s trade efforts might help the beleaguered Kemmerer coal mine land export contracts in time to save it from potentially closing, Gordon said, “I don’t have a silver bullet for that right now. But I can tell you, I’m rummaging around in my ammo box for it.”
Carbon capture hopes and Kemmerer coal
Kemmerer Operations LLC recently laid off 28 workers, and many in southwest Wyoming worry there may be more job losses, or that the mine might even close.
The mine’s biggest customer — the nearby Naughton power plant, which accounts for about 42% of the mine’s coal production, according to federal documents — will stop burning coal by the end of the year as its owner, PacifiCorp, converts the plant to natural gas fuel. 
There remains a mix of hope and skepticism for two proposals to tap the Kemmerer coal mine for coal-to-products projects — potentially making up for the pending loss of the Naughton coal contract. In fact, an official from Kanata Clean Power & Climate Technologies Corp. joined Gordon on the Japan and Taiwan trade mission.

The company proposes a multi-billion-dollar effort to cleanly convert about 1.8 million tons of Kemmerer coal annually into ammonia, primarily as an agricultural fertilizer. Another company, TriSight LLC, claims to have “unlocked” a process to convert the coal into myriad products, including graphite, agricultural fertilizer and makeup — using about 1 million tons per year from the Kemmerer mine, all while avoiding coal’s typical carbon emissions. 
But neither project appears on the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council’s working list of applications — a required regulatory step for such projects. Taken at face value, the lack of an ISC permit application indicates that neither proposal is likely to consume Kemmerer coal within the next year or so.
“The Wyoming coal-to-ammonia project team is evaluating multiple siting alternatives, a list of alternatives that includes the Kemmerer mine surface lease,” F.E. “Wally” Wolski, who works with Kanata, told WyoFile via email.

Although WyoFile has not fully investigated the financial preparedness of either TriSight or Kanata, some southwest Wyoming officials regard both coal-to-products proposals as a potential lifeline for the mine. Kemmerer City Administrator Brian Muir told WyoFile that both projects underscore signs of a potential rebound in the coal market and the potential for technologies to find new uses for coal.
“This is not over yet,” Muir told WyoFile in March. “There’s years and years of coal reserves here, and technologies to convert [coal into products].”
Among the most exciting topics discussed on his trade mission to Japan and Taiwan, Gordon said, was an agreement to support coal technologies that reduce its carbon footprint.
“[We talked] about the progression of technologies that could go forward, and that generated a lot of excitement,” Gordon said.

Complaints about fees and timeliness led a legislative committee to prioritize the issue this off-season. 
The post Wyoming legislators to review public records, open meetings laws appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming lawmakers are set to discuss the state’s public record and open meetings laws next week in Lander. What changes, if any, the Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee may seek remains to be seen, but legislators made the subject an off-season priority due to a variety of concerns. 
“Complaints have arisen in a few areas,” according to a letter sent by the Joint Corporations Committee chairmen to the Legislature’s Management Council in March. 
Those concerns related to the effectiveness of the state’s ombudsman program, the costs government entities impose on records requesters and the “ignorance and disregard of public records and public meetings statutes by public officials,” the letter states. 
“I know we can tackle the fee question and the timeliness and maybe some small changes. A bigger rewrite is a big lift,” Senate Corporations Committee Chairman Cale Case, R-Lander, told WyoFile. 
“But I think we should hear what’s wrong with our open meetings, public records, all that stuff,” he said. 
How Wyoming compares
Ahead of the meeting, the Legislative Service Office prepared a memo comparing Wyoming’s laws with neighboring states. There are multiple notable differences.
For one, Wyoming’s definition of public records differs from most other states, according to the memo, in the way it specifies that public records only include information in physical form. 
“In contrast, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah define records as public regardless of format,” the memo states. 
The Equality State also requires public records to relate to official functions or public business, whereas most neighboring states define it more broadly to encompass any document belonging to, used by, or maintained by a public entity. 
While Wyoming does not specify fee amounts for copies or staff time, according to the memo, other states have established fixed rates. That includes Colorado, which stipulates that the cost of copying a page may not exceed 25 cents, and the hourly rate for staff time is set at $30 and is adjusted every five years for inflation. Colorado and other neighboring states also offer a certain number of copies or staff time hours free of charge before fees apply. 
“Some states, including Colorado, Idaho, South Dakota and Utah, provide fee waivers if the requester can demonstrate that releasing the records is of public interest, is not for personal gain, or the requester experiences financial hardship,” the memo states. 
Wyoming is one of four states in the country to have specific exemptions for lawmakers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Meaning, that unlike city council or school board members across the state, legislators are largely not subject to public records requests. 
The Legislature passed such an exemption in 2006, and then doubled down and voted to override Gov. Dave Freudenthal’s veto of the bill. 
Ombudsman

Wyoming’s public records ombudsman also sets it apart from most of its neighbors. 
For about three years, it’s been Darlena Potter’s job to educate public officials about what’s required of them under the law and to help resolve issues regarding records requests of state and local government agencies. 
Complaints can be submitted to the ombudsman, who can then mediate disputes, prescribe timelines for the release of records and waive fees charged by a governmental entity. 
The Legislature created the position in 2019 as part of a broader public records reform effort. The changes also created a 30-day deadline for the release of most records and required governmental entities to designate a public records person and post their contact information on the Department of Administration and Information’s website. 
What the 2019 law did not do was authorize the ombudsman to enforce Wyoming’s public records laws. And as a result, government entities don’t always comply and disputes continue to land in court. 
As Potter told WyoFile last month, she’s optimistic about lawmakers’ renewed interest in her role and improving public record statutes. She’s scheduled to address the committee at next week’s meeting.

A birth certificate stamped Wyoming doesn't qualify as authority or expertise, guest columnist Marion Yoder writes.
The post Nativism is no virtue appeared first on WyoFile .","Amazingly, I’ve found common ground with Freedom Caucus legislators Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, and Steve Johnson, R-Cheyenne. They recently wrote in Cheyenne’s paper about the fallacy that one must be born in Wyoming to want to help the state. They correctly stated, “If the only qualification for good policy is a birth certificate stamped in Wyoming, we’re in trouble.” Too bad they didn’t stop there and omit claiming the Freedom Caucus, infamous for recent blunders like unconstitutionally gutting public education and encouraging guns in grade schools, aspires to “uphold the Constitution.” 

Opinion

Still, they’re right that Wyoming birth qualifies no one as an authority on Wyoming. Like so much else, you don’t choose your birthplace. Same with skin color, sexual identity and family of origin. Everyone’s entitled to relish heritage, but not to borrow glory.
Not that I don’t try. The good representatives continued, “Ideas should rise or fall on their own merit — not on where someone’s great-grandfather ran cattle.” As it happens, mine ran his in Laramie County, which then reached to Montana. My forebears were, wait for it, immigrants, having struck out twice further east. Like many others, they came here seeking a better life. They relied upon the kindness of a Native American family who looked after my 12-year-old grandfather for the winter while my great-grandfather went back to Iowa to bring out more Yoders.  
To the extent that this story might inform my own ideas about the value of immigrants today, wonderful. But I deserve no points for the postholes they dug for the Swan Company or the homestead they bought out and improved on Bear Creek.  
When Becket Hinckley, born and raised in Basin, ran successfully for a Cheyenne seat in the 2000s, he was vilified as a Californian — he’d attended Stanford. Such parochialism inspired my letter to the editor, with which Pendergraft and Johnson should logically agree.  
Today, protesters are showing up all around Wyoming to resist the excesses and abuses of the Trump administration. Harriet Hageman has received her fair share of complaints about it. What has been her reaction?  
When her responses were jeered in Laramie on March 19, she called the protesters “organized.” Her apologists claimed they were paid and brought into the state to flood the event. I attended her March 20 town hall in Wheatland, which was packed with what looked and sounded to me like Wyoming people. I heard, “I’m a lifelong Republican, but I’m worried about __________” repeatedly.   
Hageman thereafter switched to virtual town halls but is now doing very controlled in-person events. You must preregister, giving your full name, address, and email address, and agree to receive her newsletter. It’s not clear if out-of-staters or even out-of-county Wyomingites will be allowed in.
I bet no one except police is being paid to show up at the rallies I attend. I recognize lots of people — from church, volunteer work and around town. They’re hardly out-of-staters “being brought in” or “paid.” At one, I asked a mother and daughter where they were from and they said Saddle Ridge, north of Cheyenne. Most people driving past the Capitol honking in support display the ugly new Wyoming plates.
But so what if some protesters aren’t from Wyoming? Does it make their concerns about the state of the country any less compelling if they call Nebraska or Colorado home? I write to senators from other states whenever the spirit moves me. To his staff’s credit, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., answers, even though I live here. His recent reply was quicker and lots better than what I get from Barrasso. His milquetoast assertions about the “waste, fraud and abuse” co-president Musk has “found” fall flat and ignore the fallout Barrasso’s constituents are suffering under Musk’s chainsaw.
Call me a foolish optimist, but I think it’s great for America that people are exercising First Amendment rights and demanding that our leaders know just how dimly we view the improper rejigging of our government. It’s good for the body politic to remind itself where the real power in this country is — vested in us. If that means that we, the people, have to walk around carrying signs, so be it. I just wish I’d needlepointed one I saw on TV: “I’m so angry I stitched this so I could legally stab something 4000 times.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Leaders of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), a national network of immigration reform activists, held a virtual press conference Wednesday, ahead of a nationwide day of action on May 1. Although May Day demonstrations are held annually, this year the protests carry a new gravity. Leaders of organizations including FAIR, composed of 38 immigrant-led groups across 32 states, drew attention to the arrest of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, and growing concerns about the Trump Administration targeting immigrant communities. 
Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the Wisconsin-based Voces de la Frontera, said momentum to resist Trump’s  policies has grown after the April 1 Wisconsin Supreme Court election. “It was a resounding defeat at the voting booth for Trump’s endorsed candidate for our state Supreme Court race, and a resounding rejection of Elon Musk’s blatant efforts to buy our election,” Neumann-Ortiz said during the Wednesday press conference.

After the election, Wisconsinites mobilized to participate in mass protests against Trump and Musk’s firing of federal workers and canceling of federal programs. United, mass actions, Neumann-Ortiz said, will be crucial in the days ahead. The May Day protest, she said, “really represents the next iteration in this warring resistance to Trump’s efforts to impose dictatorship in this country, and to really challenge the scapegoating of immigrants and refugees for social inequality [while]  he is contributing to significantly widening that gap.” 
May Day also will be an important platform to build alliances between working-class people, she said. Neumann-Ortiz said communities in Wisconsin had recently experienced “an operation that was being conducted by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security investigators under so-called ‘wellness checks’ of unaccompanied [immigrant] minors and their sponsors’ homes.” 
Voces de la Fronterea learned of the operation through a 24/7 immigration emergency hotline the group operates. Neumann-Ortiz told Wisconsin Examiner that Voces de la Frontera is aware of such cases in Milwaukee, Whitewater, and Waukesha. The group had received a call involving an 8th grade student who was home alone when several armed agents arrived, allegedly saying they didn’t need a judicial warrant to enter. 
“So again, it was just these manipulative tactics,” Neumann-Ortiz told Wisconsin Examiner. After Voces de la Frontera was contacted, the group sent an immediate community response to assess what was going on. “What we uncovered is that basically this was an operation that’s being conducted to check in on unaccompanied minors who had come through and had a sponsor like, in this case, a family member. But again, this is not the role of the FBI. Their job is to target organized crime, or trafficking, things like that. They do not…This is not how any kind of wellness check is conducted. This is not the body…the agency that would do that.” 
  Protesters gather outside the Milwaukee FBI office on April 26. (Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)
Neumann-Ortiz said that Voces members insisted that if agents wanted to interview the minor, they should go to an attorney’s office to do the interview. “We do feel that this is, I would say, highly suspect in terms of what could unfold.”
Wisconsin Examiner reached out to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) offices in Milwaukee regarding the “wellness checks.” A FBI spokesperson said in an emailed statement that, “The FBI is assisting our partners including, Homeland Security Investigations and Office of Refugee Resettlement, with a nationwide effort to conduct welfare checks on thousands of unaccompanied children who have been identified as crossing the border without a parent or legal guardian. Sadly, children crossing the border alone and living in the U.S. without the protection of a loving parent or guardian can be vulnerable to exploitation, trafficking, and violence. Protecting children is a critical mission for the FBI and we will continue to work with our federal, state, and local partners to secure their safety and well-being.”
An ICE spokesperson said in an email the agency is “familiar” with the Wisconsin Examiner’s inquiry, and said to contact the Department of Homeland Security. In response to Wisconsin Examiner’s inquiry, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement, “The previous administration allowed many of these children who came across the border unaccompanied to be placed with sponsors who were actually smugglers and sex traffickers.” 
McLaughlin added, “DHS is leading efforts to conduct welfare checks on these children to ensure that they are safe and not being exploited. Unlike the previous administration, President Trump and Secretary Noem take the responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to reunite children with their families. In less than 100 days, Secretary Noem and Secretary Kennedy have already reunited over 5,000 unaccompanied children with a relative or safe guardian.”

Since late March, at least three people have been arrested by ICE agents as they appeared at the Milwaukee County Courthouse for routine proceedings. The most recent arrest also resulted in an FBI investigation being launched against Judge Dugan, who federal agencies accuse of obstructing their effort to arrest a man who was appearing before her. The arrest drew thousands of people into the streets to support Dugan. On Saturday, April 26, over 1,200 people gathered outside the Milwaukee FBI office, decrying Dugan’s arrest as authoritarian, fascist, and inconsistent with American values. 
On the press conference call Wednesday, Neumann-Ortiz was joined by leaders of FIRM-member organizations from across the country. May Day protests are expected in states across the country. David Chiles, interim executive director of Sunflower Community Action in Kansas said Trump’s policies are “a race to the bottom” and “a war on wages, on benefits, on dignity itself.” Chiles said that on Thursday, “we’re fighting back.” Cathryn Jackson, public policy director of CASA, who will march with groups toward the White House, said, “Immigrants and allies are rising up to say ‘enough is enough.’  May 1, international day of action, we are joining hundreds of marches, rallies, walk-outs, demonstrations with one very clear unified message” — One struggle, one fight, workers unite.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)For more than a year, state LGBTQ advocates spearheaded a campaign that helped hundreds of transgender individuals obtain U.S. passports that reflect their gender identity and physical appearance after Tennessee ended gender updates for state drivers’ licenses. 
But an executive order issued on President Donald Trump’s first day in office — declaring U.S. policy is to “recognize two sexes, male and female” — ended the ability of transgender people to get passports that reflect their gender. A federal court temporarily blocked the order last month, but a final legal outcome has yet to be decided.
In Tennessee, where state officials in 2023 denied trans people the right to make gender changes on driver’s licenses, Trump’s executive order has jeopardized the only available form of government-issued ID available that accurately reflects the gender of transgender and nonbinary Tennesseans.
“Tennessee has the least amount of access to change gender markers,” said Molly Quinn, executive director of OUTMemphis. “A lot of transgender people here used passports as their primary gender marker.”
Trump’s order, she said, has created anxiety and uncertainty. On the day the president issued it,  Quinn’s organization fielded 27 calls from individuals anxious to learn whether they could still begin the passport application process, she said. 
Tennessee has long prevented trans people from amending their gender designation on birth certificates, the only state in the nation to explicitly do so. 
The 1977 law was upheld last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit Court, which found “there is no fundamental right to a birth certificate recording gender identity instead of biological sex.”










Tennessee has the least amount of access to change gender markers. A lot of transgender people here used passports as their primary gender marker.

Gender, however, could be amended on Tennessee drivers’ licenses until Republican-backed legislation in 2023 defined “sex” in Tennessee law as “a person’s immutable biological sex as determined by anatomy and genetics existing at time of birth.” Evidence of biological sex, the law said, is listed on a birth certificate.
The Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security then posted notice of new rules that it would not accept requests for gender marker changes that were inconsistent with an individuals’ birth certificate.  A legal challenge to the department’s rules, filed last year by the ACLU of Tennessee in Davidson County Chancery Court, remains ongoing.
Immediately following the drivers license notice, OUTMemphis, ACLU of Tennessee and other advocacy organizations made a statewide push to help individuals secure U.S. passports.
Between the passage of the 2023 Tennessee legislation and Trump’s inauguration, the groups assisted more than 200 people in obtaining a U.S. passport to reflect their gender identity and physical presentation, Quinn said.
Government issued documents that reflect accurate gender identity and appearance can be critically important, Quinn noted. 
Interactions with police or Transportation Safety Agency officers at security checkpoints examining IDs that appear at odds with an individual’s physical appearance may subject individuals to interrogation, allegations of fraud or criminal behavior and harassment. IDs are also checked by employers, financial institutions and election officials.
Christian Mays, community center coordinator for OUTMemphis, said all his official identity documents identify him as female. Mays, a transgender man, said he was pulled over once by police who accused him of impersonating someone else, because he presented as a man but his ID listed him as a woman. 
Mays recently got his name legally changed. He submitted his passport application to include his male gender identity the day before Trump’s executive order. His chief concern at the time was the ability to apply for a part time job at a pizza restaurant, which would require an ID. 
He said he is now uncertain whether a passport reflecting his gender identity will come through.
“I was thinking it was finally my time,” Mays said.

For Wisconsin, the longer term outlook appears more certain, although there may be little comfort from that.

Speaking at an economic forecast luncheon hosted by the Wisconsin Bankers Association and the news outlet WisBusiness, part of WisPolitcs.com, Dale Knapp, director of research at Forward Analytics, reviewed the persistent demographic slump that has put Wisconsin on a troubling trajectory for the coming decades.
That trajectory has been evident already for some 20 years, Knapp said, and it centers on the population bulge from baby boomers — people born between 1946 and 1964. That generation was 65% more numerous than the group born in the previous 19-year period, he said. And the subsequent generations have been about 20% smaller in number or even less.
The baby boom produced an explosion of demand for everything from toys to homes to schools and universities, Knapp observed. Now the last of that generation is passing into retirement, and with smaller populations in the generations that follow there are “worker shortages all across the state,” Knapp said.

Between 2020 and 2040, the working age population, ages 18 to 64, is projected to fall by 15% on average in all but six Wisconsin counties, Knapp said. Automation may pick up the slack in some industries, including manufacturing and possibly fast food service, he suggested.
Immigration is another remedy, Knapp said — but also “a challenge given what’s going on in the White House now.”
“We need to fix the border problem to a degree,” Knapp said. “If you do that, then maybe you can get the two parties in Washington together and say, ‘OK, we need to fix legal immigration by expanding it.'”
Knapp’s other proffered solution is to invest funds to offer families $16,000 to move to Wisconsin from out of state. With 3,000 families a year, the money could be repaid with the added income and sales tax revenues, “and we could fund it forever,” he said.
National economic uncertainty
Outlining the current state of the nation’s pocketbook and its near-term forecast, economist Andrea Sorensen of US Bank in Minneapolis said that the economy “is actually doing probably better than most people think.”
That’s despite the uncertainty that has ballooned since President Donald Trump took office in January, she said. That uncertainty also looms over the horizon, however.
The nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — the broadest measure of the overall economy — has been growing by more than 2% over the last couple of years through the end of 2024.
  US Bank economist Andrea Sorensen speaks at a Wisconsin Bankers Association luncheon Wednesday, April 30, 2025. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)
Data issued Wednesday morning showed GDP shrank 0.3% in the first quarter. Sorensen said that was for an unusual reason, however.
U.S. businesses stocked up on goods from overseas to get ahead of the tariffs Trump imposed after taking office, she said. She attributed the slight first-quarter dip to those imports, because their value is subtracted from GDP.
The GDP estimate released Wednesday is the first of three that will be produced for the quarter, and Sorensen said her economic team believes the next two estimates will be better.
She views other indicators as relatively favorable.
The national labor market remains strong. Month-to-month employment growth has cooled some since the hiring spikes that followed the economic crash from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Still, “we still consider it to be quite healthy,” she said.
“People who have jobs have money to spend,” Sorensen said. “So as long as the labor market is holding up, we think the economy could be OK.”
Consumer spending also remains strong, she said, even though surveys show dramatic declines in both consumer and business confidence.
“We know it means people are not happy and they don’t have high hopes,” Sorensen said. “But if we’re talking recession, that sort of depressed sentiment needs to translate into actual economic activity. And so far, it hasn’t. And we’re not actually sure if it will.”
Tariffs are a wild card
The Trump administration’s tariff policies, however, remain a major wild card.
A broad 10% tax on imports that took effect April 5 remains in place with a few exceptions. Tariffs of up to 50% on about 60 countries are on a 90-day pause. An active tariff remains on goods from China — initially 125% and more recently raised to 145%.
Overall that’s netted out to a U.S. effective tariff rate — the net tariff on all imports from other countries — between 25% and 30%. That’s 10 times the effective tariff rate of 2.5% a year ago.
“This hasn’t happened in over 100 years,” Sorensen said. “The economy is just structurally very different, and we can try to make forecasts and comparisons —  and we do all day every day —  but we don’t know. There is just so much unknown what this will do.”
For that reason, economic uncertainty is “sky high,” she continued. “I don’t think anyone really knows what’s going on.”
Businesses “are kind of paralyzed,” Sorensen said. “How can you make a business investment decision if you have no idea what tariffs are going to be tomorrow, next week, next year?”
Some larger employers have already begun announcing plans to reshore work in the U.S. But Sorensen said in response to one audience member’s question that isn’t an option for many smaller employers.
A company that sources products overseas might gain a temporary advantage by returning production to the U.S., she said.
“They can’t risk making the wrong choice,” however, Sorensen said. “What we’re hearing is they don’t trust that that tariff will remain in place. So, they can’t make the investment decisions to bring production back to the U.S. because they might want to undo it again as soon as policy changes.”
In addition, “our supply chains are so intertwined that everything has some input that’s imported,” she said.
Tariffs will also squeeze low- and middle-income households, where spending takes a larger share of their earnings — “households that were already struggling,” Sorensen said.
Migration presents another pressure point. Policies to reduce immigration and deport immigrants will hurt some states and some sectors of the economy more than others, she said.
Yet an additional unknown is how the escalating trade conflicts with the rest of the world will affect services — where the U.S. has a trade surplus.
“President Trump has never mentioned that, because he probably doesn’t want us to know that, right? It makes trade look a little more fair, but that’s not the story he wants,” Sorensen said.
So far, other countries haven’t targeted U.S. services in retaliation for the tariffs it has imposed.
Nevertheless, “if countries really want to get us economically, they would go after services,” Sorensen said.

(Michael Loccisano | Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
‘It’s the system that needs fixing’
Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law Monday.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
The new law requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading. That bill died in House Education.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
Opposition to ‘science of reading’
Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.










A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

The Census is the oldest continuous data collection effort run by the federal government, and is collected every 10 years, shaping the country’s data infrastructure for over two centuries. 
At its core, it is meant to be an official, complete count of the United States’ population. It may record details about people such as age, gender and living arrangements. But more than that, the census is critical to the well-being of children and the entire U.S. 

Why? Here are a few things the census can do for all of us:
Representation: The census determines how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives and is used to draw Congressional and state legislative districts.
Funding: It plays a pivotal role in determining how we fund federal programs like Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), highway planning and the Pell Grant program.
Research: Governments and nonprofits utilize the census data to make decisions, such as planning community services, infrastructure and housing developments, and determining where hospitals get built.
Equity: If done correctly, the census can shed light on disparities within states and communities, helping to fight for racial, economic and geographic equity.
The census isn’t perfect, though. Unfortunately, children — especially young children, Black and Brown children, children experiencing homelessness, and children in low-income households — are most often routinely undercounted. This creates serious consequences for education, health care and other pivotal support programs.
And recently, there have been emerging efforts to erode trust in the census through misinformation, loss of advisory committees and attacks on census participation.
In March, following executive orders to terminate “unnecessary” advisory committees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick disbanded three critical groups: the Census Scientific Advisory Committee, the National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic, and Other Populations, and the 2030 Census Advisory Committee. 
These groups offered scientific and technical guidance, including cybersecurity, survey methodology and strategies for reaching diverse populations. They have historically been bipartisan, improving census quality and community trust. Their loss will make it harder to design effective outreach and ensure vulnerable populations are fully counted.
Undermining the census in these ways weakens the foundation of the Kids Count data we use at the Michigan League for Public Policy — and important data used by organizations across the nation who serve kids and families. Kids Count relies heavily on accurate resident population and demographic estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
When census data is incomplete or unreliable — due to disbanded advisory committees, underfunded surveys, or the strategic addition of sensitive questions to suppress participation — it directly compromises our ability to measure and track child well-being at national, state and local levels.
According to Count All Kids, the count of young children was even worse in 2020 than in 2010. Researchers and advocates can’t make the case for necessary policy solutions if we are undercounting vulnerable children. When kids are counted, it gives their communities more power to secure funding for programs that matter.
Trust is crucial to ensuring full census participation. Title 13 of the United States Code guarantees the confidentiality of census responses, making it illegal for the Census Bureau to publish or share identifiable information. It is important that people know their information is protected under federal law — this helps maintain public trust and participation, even amid political concerns. Building trust through community-based outreach, using locally trusted messengers, remains key. We must also demand policies that restore advisory committees and protect childrens’ data. Investing in census education and community engagement hubs, and ensuring strong data privacy protections, will be critical for the 2030 Census.
The census is not simply a count — it’s the cornerstone of fair resource distribution and democratic representation. Preparing and advocating for the 2030 Census shouldn’t begin in 2029. It begins today. Protecting our data is protecting our democracy, and we must act to ensure that every person is seen, valued and counted.

Jim Risch, R-Idaho, met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in June 2022 in Kyiv. (Screenshot from Instagram video)Although U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, is one of those congressional lifers who does not have a particularly distinguished record on domestic issues, he has exercised good sense on some national security issues. He has long seen the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance as an essential component of America’s national defense. For instance, in 2023 he called NATO “the most successful political and defensive organization that’s ever been on the face of the planet.” He elaborated: “NATO is important because the national security of the United States of America is the most important issue that the federal government exists for. And there is nothing that gives us better security than the NATO organization.”
Risch has correctly understood that the national security of the United States and other NATO nations would be seriously endangered if Russia were to win its genocidal war against Ukraine. In December of 2022, the senator listed a long list of actions he had taken that year to “ensure Ukraine has the equipment and support it needs to win.” It included his Senate Resolution 713, condemning Putin’s genocidal war against the Ukrainians, including countless “heinous crimes against humanity.” 
Risch has sounded the alarm that, “Putin is not going to stop with Ukraine” if he wins the war. If we end up in war with Russia, what we’re spending here is a drop in the bucket by comparison.” That is, a win by Russia in Ukraine would lead to a follow-on attack against some of our NATO partners, which would require the United States to enter the hostilities. It does not get more serious than that.
The U.S. has stood strong with Ukraine because of the threat the war poses to U.S. security. President Biden could have been more forceful in providing sophisticated weapons and few restrictions on their usage. Nevertheless, the Ukrainians were able to hold their own, largely because they were fighting for their very freedom and existence. The U.S. was filling the support role that France had played during the dark days of America’s Revolutionary War, a role that was instrumental in the birth of our nation.
Tragically, that all changed on Jan. 20, 2025, when Donald Trump assumed the presidency and began unraveling the NATO alliance, as well as our support for Ukraine. We have seen American support for Ukraine evaporating at an alarming rate. 
Trump consistently pushes the false claim that Ukraine started the war. His United Nations delegation even joined Russia, North Korea, Iran and 13 other cut-throat nations in voting against a resolution condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine. Trump has floated a so-called peace plan that will give Putin practically everything he wants, while seriously endangering the future existence of Ukraine as a sovereign and free nation. The peace deal would leave all of the NATO nations on the Russian border in imminent danger. 
As this disastrous situation plays out at a rapid and frightening pace, we hear very few Republican voices in Congress speaking out and sounding the alarm. One who stands out is U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican and retired Air Force brigadier general, who implored Trump and Congress to continue our support of Ukraine and “advance America’s long-term national interests in the process.”
With his strong past support for NATO and Ukraine and a clear understanding of the approaching calamity, it is inexplicable that Sen. Risch, the chairman of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, would not be raising the roof and demanding a change of course. If we sell out Ukraine and allow it to fall to Putin’s atrocious war, it will be a disaster for that gallant nation and a contemptible stain on America’s honor.
If Putin’s war is genocidal, as both Risch and I believe, silence and non-action on the part of one who is in a position to speak out and avert it is cowardice of the first order. It amounts to complicity in the slaughter and enslavement of Ukrainians that will inevitably follow. What could possibly explain Risch’s failure to rally opposition to this travesty? Perhaps a change of heart on the critical importance of Ukraine and NATO? 
Or, maybe a pat on the head and a coveted endorsement from Trump for six more years in the prestigious U.S. Senate?

(Courtesy of Denise Powell for Congress)LINCOLN — Denise Powell, known for her role boosting new candidates with Women Who Run, is running for Congress in 2026 in Nebraska’s 2nd District. 
Powell told the Nebraska Examiner on Wednesday that she is running because many people in the Omaha area have lost a “voice in D.C.,” and the district needs more “everyday working” people. 
She said she would prioritize protecting Medicaid and Social Security, vote to ensure the federal government does its part to boost quality K-12 education and push back against the Trump administration.
“I am not a politician,” said Powell, who is stepping away from her role with the nonprofit she helped found. “And quite frankly, I think at this moment that’s actually a good thing.”  
Her announcement comes on the heels of Bacon confirming last week that he is considering retiring and State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha publicly acknowledging he is exploring a bid. The prospects of a potentially crowded midterm primary field could excite local Democrats. State party officials have said they talked with “strong candidates” for months.
Bacon’s seat a target

Nebraska Democrats, who view Bacon’s seat as vulnerable with him in it or not, have a first major candidate. Powell is trying to do what former State Sen. Tony Vargas fell short of twice — becoming the first non-Republican to represent Nebraska in Congress since the late former U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford in 2017. 
Powell said she’s hopeful this will be a political moment when voters are done with partisan lines, as people are “really frustrated by our elected officials who were supposed to represent us.”
“That’s the message that I’m bringing to this campaign,” Powell said. “This is a campaign to support all Nebraskans.”
Though Powell hasn’t held an elected office, she has played a role in Nebraska politics. She has helped with organizing recent ballot initiatives seeking to codify the right to an abortion, which failed, and to repeal a publicly funded voucher program for private K-12 schools, which succeeded. 
She said her experience running the Women Run Nebraska, a political action committee that aims to get more women in elected office, has shown her just how much people from all parties “care deeply about their communities.”
“I think our community needs that voice,” Powell said. “The working mom’s voice who’s gonna just step in there and fight for them.”
Once again, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates Bacon’s seat as a Republican toss-up. The slightly GOP-leaning district is Nebraska’s most politically divided and diverse.
The 2nd District voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 and former President Joe Biden in 2020 after voting for President Donald Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012. It backed then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. 
Bacon has fended off Democratic challengers in close races in previous years and has bucked the “blue dot” voting trend in the past two presidential elections. The retired Air Force brigadier general is a reliable House Republican vote on most matters. But he has again stepped into the national spotlight as one of the few House Republicans willing to criticize the Trump administration.
Frustration with Washington

Powell said people are uncertain, frustrated, and worried about what’s happening in Washington, amid economic uncertainty, including high inflation and efforts to cut social programs like Medicaid.
“Unfortunately, Don Bacon is somebody who is really good at saying all the right things,” Powell said. “But at the end of the day, he is taking votes in DC that are hurting Nebraskans.”
Bacon told the Examiner late last month that he was considering retirement, but has raised funds to leave him the choice of running again. Bacon’s campaign manager said his recent fundraising “keeps all options open ahead of 2026.” 
Regardless of whether Bacon retires from Congress, the outlines of a potential midterm race are becoming clearer after independent Dan Osborn focused his efforts on the U.S. Senate, and potential Republican suitors line up to jump in if Bacon gets out. 
Former 2022 GOP gubernatorial candidate Brett Lindstrom has told people in political circles that he is interested in a potential bid if Bacon retires. Another name being discussed is Dan Frei, who ran against Bacon in the 2024 GOP primary. 
National attention
The 2nd District has already drawn attention from state and national Democrats this year, with Democrats leading in-person town halls and advertising buys from multiple Democratic-aligned groups.
In addition to Cavanaugh, perennial candidate Evangelos Argyrakis has said he is running. Argyrakis withdrew from the 2018 attorney general’s race after facing a charge of abuse, neglect or exploitation of a vulnerable adult, has said he’s running. 
Cavanaugh said this week that he plans to decide whether to run after the legislative session or sooner, regardless of who else is running or when they enter the race. He pointed to his “record of effective leadership and experience crafting legislation to make people’s lives better and defeating bad public policy, which is equally important.”
“I know if I run, I have the record to earn the vote of the people of The 2nd District of Nebraska,” Cavanaugh told the Examiner. 
Powell said she is not worried about a potential primary because she believes her message will resonate with voters.
“What’s happening in Washington, DC, is impacting their family budgets,” Powell said, “People are really scared, and they feel like nobody is speaking for them or fighting for them.”

Those living near the corridor were take to a state-operated transitional center in Gentilly. (John Gray/Verite News)A bill to criminalize public camping and create “homelessness courts” in Louisiana passed its first hurdle Tuesday, despite objections from housing advocates and religious groups.
Senate Bill 196, sponsored by Rep. Robert Owen, R-Slidell, would make “unauthorized public camping” a crime punishable by six months in jail, a $500 fine or both for the first offense. The second offense imposes a sentence of one to two years in jail and a $1,000 fine.
A Senate committee advanced the bill in a 4-3 vote along party lines, with Republicans prevailing. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry supports the legislation.
The proposal would also allow parishes to establish a court program for unhoused people, versions of which already exist in other states. They would give defendants the option to have their conviction set aside if they agreed to be placed on supervised probation and enter into long-term substance or mental health treatment. If the person failed to complete the program, they would face criminal sentencing. The defendant would be responsible for paying program costs, unless a judge waives them.

Prosecutors and judges would have the authority to decide whether homeless defendants, facing a misdemeanor or felony charge, could be diverted to the homelessness court program. People charged with a violent crime or sex offense, or with a past homicide or sex crime conviction, would not be eligible to take part. Owen’s bill also excludes persons accused of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs that resulted in someone’s death.   
Disagreement over the bill came down to views on housing solutions. Its supporters argued enough resources exist for homeless people, but they need to be convinced to accept assistance.
“We need to have some kind of stick and carrot, essentially, attached to the bill that gives it a little teeth,” Owen told the Illuminator after the hearing. He added that amendments to his proposal are likely.
Organizations against the bill are those that advocate and support people without housing. They include the Travelers Aid Society and Unity of Greater New Orleans. Representatives with the Louisiana Interchurch Conference and the Louisiana Conference of Catholic Bishops also testified against the proposal. 
They argued the bill criminalizes homelessness without offering housing solutions, funding or support services. Sufficient affordable housing and needed treatment programs simply don’t exist in Louisiana, they said.
“Housing costs have doubled in the last 10 years. Sending these people to jail is a travesty,” said David Larsen, 50, who told lawmakers on the committee he was homeless for seven years.
Sens. Joe Bouie and Royce Duplessis, both Democrats from New Orleans, expressed skepticism about the expense of setting up homelessness courts falling on state and local governments and lack of housing support for people as they go through addiction or mental health treatment. 
Bouie specifically took issue with the bill’s requirement for a 12-month treatment plan. 
“What’re they doing during that time if they don’t have housing?” Bouie asked. “Where do they go? Back on the streets?”
Duplessis noted he lives near encampments in New Orleans, where he often sees homeless people who are not suffering from behavioral health issues and would benefit from simple financial support. According to federal data, 40% to 60% of homeless people in the U.S. have a job, but their wages have not kept up with the cost of housing.
“They literally can’t afford a place to live,” he said.
Meghan Garvey of the Louisiana Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys said Owen’s bill would only exacerbate homelessness in the state. 
“This isn’t informed by any of the best practices” the American Bar Association recommends for homelessness courts, Garvey said, stressing the bill is “creating a whole new crime.” 
Will Harrell of the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which operates the city jail, testified against opposed the bill. He warned it would worsen chronic capacity issues there. “There is no more room in the inn,” he said.
According to Orleans Sheriff Susan Hutson, it costs $53,000 to keep someone in jail for a year. Permanent supportive housing costs about $16,000 annually, said Angela Owczarek with the New Orleans housing advocacy organization Jane’s Place.
‘These resources don’t exist’
Christopher Walters, the governor’s deputy general counsel, appeared before the committee to support Owen’s bill and rejected opponents’ framing of it. 
“I don’t believe this is criminalizing homelessness,” he said. “It’s criminalizing actions like erecting tents on public property.” 
Walters and Owen suggested sufficient housing vouchers and nonprofit services already exist to help people. Owen also rejected the idea that housing is the solution to homelessness.
“I just don’t think building more housing is the way out of this,” the senator told the committee.
Housing advocates provided data in the meeting to contradict Owen’s statement.
Jennifer Carlyle of East Baton Rouge’s Continuum of Care said her homelessness service provider coalition has 2,000 people on its waiting list for housing vouchers, many of whom have waited for months or years for rental assistance. 
Louisiana is short 117,000 affordable housing units, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
“We’re asking people to get housed without having housing to put them in,” Carlyle said.
Some bill opponents also stressed that a person’s homelessness does not reflect a lack of desire to be housed. Donna Paramore of Travelers Aid said 98% of the people her nonprofit places in homes stay housed.
Detox and treatment centers often have weeks-long waitlists for beds, according to Owczarek. 
“These resources don’t exist in our state,” she said.
Detractors of the bill also said it would likely disproportionately affect people of color, noting that more than 55% of tenants facing eviction in New Orleans are Black women. 
“Just weeks ago, a single mom with five kids was sleeping in a van on my corner because no family shelter spaces were available,” Owczarek told the committee. “There’s nothing to stop this bill from leading to her arrest.”
Owen’s bill comes in the wake of a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that asserted it is not cruel and unusual punishment to arrest people who are sleeping outside when no shelter space is available.
The bill is similar to model legislation supported by the Cicero Institute, a public policy group whose backers include Elon Musk. Cicero has two lobbyists registered in Louisiana.

The program employs about 3,000 people. (Getty Images)Samantha Casto, a preschool teacher at Ravenswood Head Start, is making the outdoors her classroom this spring. Her four- and five-year-old students are learning about bug habitats and digging their tiny hands into the dirt.
“It’s not ‘sit down at a desk and learn,’” said Casto, 33. “They get to learn in a fun way.”
Head Start offers free child care, early education, meals and more to thousands of low-income children in West Virginia. There are support services for families, as well. 
Under President Donald Trump, the program could be terminated. 
The Trump administration is asking Congress to eliminate funding for Head Start, which would shutter programs nationwide.
In West Virginia, it would terminate preschool and services for nearly 8,000 children and cut 3,000 jobs. 
“I can’t imagine how West Virginia would fare — our children, families, even our economy … I don’t know how these families would go to work,” said Lori Milam, executive director of the West Virginia Head Start Association. “It would be devastating. It really would.”
  Samantha Casto
Casto has worked at Ravenswood Head Start for 11 years. “I’m devastated and upset,” she said.
The Trump administration has already slashed Head Start staff, closed half the program’s regional offices and delayed funding.
Several states, including Pennsylvania, and advocacy groups are suing the Trump administration over the looming Head Start funding cuts. The lawsuit alleges that the actions already taken against the program, including shuttering its regional offices, required congressional approval.
Milam said West Virginia Head Start is waiting on grant money needed May 1 for programs that serve 1,000 children.
“There’s no communication because of closing the [regional] Head Start offices,” she said. 
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said in an email, “At this point in time, Sen. Capito is continuing to work with [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] to ensure that West Virginia Head Start centers receive their grant money.”
  Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio
Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., and Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., did not return comments for this story. 
West Virginia’s Head Start programs are solely reliant on federal funding and received $83 million in 2024.
State Sen. Laura Chapman, who chairs the Senate Health Committee, said she would see if the state could fund the program should the federal cuts go through. 
“A cut to Head Start would be devastating, however, I do support the Trump administration’s goals in reducing bureaucracy and administrative costs,” said Chapman, R-Ohio. “If it does happen, I believe that the state should step up and try to fill in the gaps.”
“I support Head Start and our families,” she added.
Head Start closure would worsen state’s child care shortage 
Head Start’s potential closure would worsen the state’s child care shortage. More than 25,000 children in West Virginia don’t have access to child care, and hundreds of child care facilities have closed in the state in the last few years.
Northern Panhandle Head Start serves five counties, including Wetzel County, where there is no licensed child care center. The program partners with five nearby child care centers to provide funds that help pay teachers. 
“Our Head Start [programs] are some of the only available centers that children can go to,” said Jackie Bell, executive director of Northern Panhandle Head Start. “I’m very concerned about the proposed budget cuts. It threatens the stability and the future of our early childhood education.”
“We’re more than a preschool program,” she continued. “It allows [families] to go out and get jobs and work during the day and know their child is taking care of and receiving quality programming.”
Bell said 120 staff will lose their jobs if her Head Start program is forced to close. 
The National Institute for Early Education Research recently ranked West Virginia as fourth in the nation for preschool for four-year-olds, which was influenced by Head Start access statewide.
Head Start also serves a referral program, connecting young children with free services like speech and physical therapy through the Birth to Three program. Milam worries that children, including children in foster care and those with developmental disabilities, will slip through the cracks without screenings and services before they enter kindergarten.
Program employees also made nearly 44,000 home visits last year to check on children and provide in-home support for parents. The service plays a role in preventing children from entering West Virginia’s overburdened foster care system, Bell said.
“One of the unique pieces of our program is the parent education and training side of it,” Bell said, adding that the organization also makes referrals to Child Protective Services when necessary. 
“We’re serving the vulnerable children and families, and that’s what’s really scary about these potential cuts,” she said.
  Savannah Shamblin
Milam planned on spending this year celebrating Head Start’s 60th anniversary. Now, she is collecting testimonials and calling elected officials in hopes of saving the program. 
“I am still very, very hopeful,” she said.
Savannah Shamblin, 32, is a Head Start teacher at the Fairplain Center in Jackson County. Her students are learning the alphabet, how to spell their names and how to use silverware.
“Whenever that clicks, I get super excited … because I know I’m making a difference, and the kids get excited too,” she said.
Shamblin is worried about her job, but said, “I worry more about the children and families more.”
“We need to continue it for the next 100 years because it’s helping children that really need it,” she said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The federal government’s chief witness in Tennessee’s political corruption trial sparred Wednesday with a defense attorney, repeatedly saying she had to lie and conceal the identity of the person running a shadowy company that handled constituent mailers for lawmakers in early 2020.
Under questioning from Cynthia Sherwood, the attorney for defendant Cade Cothren, a former staffer who secretly ran New Mexico-based Phoenix Solutions, former Rep. Robin Smith said she testified “in error” previously when she said she was unaware of committing a crime when they were running the secret company.
Yet she also said at one point, “I was very well aware of lying and doubling down and concealing” the roles of Cothren and former House Speaker Glen Casada in the business scheme. Smith also said she pressured the state’s director of legislative administration to expedite payments to the company when they hit a delay.

Smith, who resigned from her legislative seat and signed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors, is charged with one count of honest services fraud in connection with a fraud and kickback scheme she allegedly ran with former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff, Cothren. According to testimony, they had to conceal Cothren’s role in running Phoenix Solutions after he resigned the post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal in April 2019. Casada stepped down from the House speaker’s post in August because of a no-confidence vote by the House Republican Caucus.
Casada and Cothren, in contrast, face 20 charges ranging from theft to fraud and honest services fraud.
Asked by Sherwood if she understood the elements of honest services fraud, Smith responded it meant she told numerous lies to keep the invalid vendor in operation. The trio grossed nearly $52,000 from work on Republican lawmakers’ constituent mailers, which are paid for through the state’s postage and printing program.
Apparently put off by Smith’s continual expounding on answers, Sherwood said, “A lot’s on the line for you today.”
Smith responded, “There’s a lot on the line for everybody.”
Sherwood then reminded her the jury already heard that Cothren hid his identity.
Under questioning, Smith also said she talked with her attorney, Ben Rose, since taking the stand Monday and had met with U.S. attorneys at least six times since her home and office were raided in January 2021.
  “Stunned,” said former state Rep. Robin Smith, pictured with her attorney, Ben Rose, of her reaction when FBI agents raided her home in January 2021. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Sherwood asked her to describe the discussions she had with Rose, eliciting laughter from the courtroom. U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson advised Smith that attorney-client talk is private, yet she still tried to give explanations to yes-or-no questions.
Sherwood told the judge she might request later that Smith waive her attorney-client privilege because of her answers.
Smith described the morning FBI agents came to her home in early 2021, saying she went to the door in her sweat pants while holding back her dog. She said she chatted with them until they gave her the chance to call her attorney. She said she left a message and resumed the conversation until her attorney told her not to talk anymore.
Smith said she welcomed the FBI into her home but “tried to withhold as much as a talkative person like myself can.” Early in Wednesday’s testimony in U.S. District Court in Nashville, Sherwood displayed several mail pieces produced by Phoenix Solutions and asked Smith if she thought the work was good. She agreed it was.
Smith said when federal agents came to her home on Jan. 8, 2021, she was “stunned” and wasn’t certain what was happening.

Workers had to drill through rock that contained high levels of silica, making workers sick within months. (National Park Services photo)As the West Virginia Legislature wound up its less than stellar session this year, the titled words to this commentary, rooted in the teachings of Hillel the Elder, a Jewish sage who lived in the first century CE, echoed in my mind, reaching an even greater, fevered pitch knowing that JFK and John Lewis were known to echo the phrase often in the context of political and social activism. The power in those five words resounds loud and clear to each of us — at least we can hope they do.
While state legislators were tasked with a number of vital pieces of legislation, I honed in on the continued and shameful disregard for the certain and necessary protections of West Virginia’s coal miners whose lives continue to be threatened from the inhalation of silica dust particles, which is the leading cause of black lung disease, along with lung cancer, kidney disease, COPD and cardiovascular illnesses. 
In learning that a federal appeals court issued a temporary stay on the implementation of what advocates have called a long overdue industry rule that would have limited how much silica dust coal miners are exposed to, I recalled one of the nation’s worst industrial tragedies — the building of the Hawks Nest Tunnel in Fayette County, West Virginia, in the early 1930s, when an economic depression plagued this country. Stop for a minute to consider the incredulity of a period of time fighting the same issue that spans nearly one hundred years. It’s outrageous.
In the fall of 1990, shortly after completing my graduate work, I wrote a piece for Goldenseal titled, “Hawks Nest, the Novel.” Since my graduate thesis focused on the history of early West Virginia authors, it would not have been complete without a discussion of Hubert Skidmore’s controversial work. Still, after all these years, the same threat to every coal miner’s life continues. It’s unfathomable that this is still an issue. In fact, it’s obscene. The silica rock that the builders of the Hawks Nest Tunnel drilled through — completely unprotected — is being breathed by Appalachian coal miners today, in 2025.
The tunnel workers developed horrendous coughs and had trouble breathing, ending their shifts covered in a thick blanket of dust. Some died and were buried in unmarked graves in a field in Summersville, often before their families were informed of their death. The only time the dust was abated was when the foreman announced the arrival of the mine inspector and turned on the water to keep the dust down. Once the mine inspector left, the water was turned off and remained off. A reviewer for the New York Times reported in 1941, “It is a story of crass injustice to make the reader’s blood boil.”
Fast forward decades later and the problem persists. Why? The answer is simple — money. Imposing regulations in order to keep the related diseases caused by the breathing of silica dust at bay cost money, and coal operators/owners don’t want their bottom lines (i.e., profits) affected negatively. Valuing profits over people’s lives is incomprehensible. How can basic, decent concern for your fellow man, the very men who risk their lives to line your pockets with even more profit, be ignored?
Yes, we are a country that is divided at every turn, wrestling with politicians who, on one side, fight for the worker and who, on the other, quite simply don’t. Corporate profits versus tighter safety measures for coal miners has a long history, none more obvious than in West Virginia.
Are we going to be writing this same story in yet another decade from now? Are we going to leave it to the next generation to tackle? At what point are we going to say, “Enough!” 
Theodore Roosevelt issued these resounding words: “There can be no life without change, and to be afraid of what is different or unfamiliar is to be afraid of life.”
I don’t think it’s inherent in the human spirit to belittle the worker and be concerned only with corporate greed. I think that the latter is a conscious choice that must certainly plague the conscience of those who choose to put their own interests above everything that is inherently decent and good about mankind. I often wonder what events, experiences led someone to toss aside respect and decency and concern for their fellow man and prioritize only their own agenda. I guarantee there is a reason, for to suggest that the workers’ concerns are irrelevant is a clear example of pure disregard for those who built this country, brick by brick and shovel by shovel, asking only that they be protected as they reaped enough to provide the basic necessities for their families, while the industry barons rode their backs all the way to the banks, not feeling the least bit responsible for the price paid by the workers. It was unacceptable then, is now, and always will be unacceptable. Yet still, it continues.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Louisville’s air pollution regulator will dispute the Trump administration’s termination of a grant that funded an air toxics monitoring study in West Louisville, a larger community effort to study air pollution health impacts in neighborhoods near the Rubbertown industrial complex. 
The Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District (APCD) received a memo from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency March 31 stating a $1 million grant from the Environmental Justice Government-to-Government Program would be terminated because, in part, it was “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, agency priorities.” An EPA official in a court filing wrote recently that the agency was canceling hundreds of EPA grants, most of them involving environmental justice programs.  
Matt Mudd, a spokesperson with APCD, told the Lantern Wednesday the regulator planned to dispute the grant termination with the EPA through an internal process. Rachael Hamilton, the executive director of APCD, in an April 16 board meeting described the option to dispute the grant termination as an “administrative remedy” that would be sent to a regional EPA administrator. Hamilton said in the meeting last month there had been a “fair amount” of litigation from other grantees that have had grants terminated. 
The funding, announced in 2023 during the Biden administration, was set to support the placement of canisters measuring volatile organic compounds and two other monitors measuring airborne metals. Some of the monitors were to be placed downwind of Rubbertown, a cluster of chemical plants near West Louisville that have long been the subject of complaints from the adjacent neighborhoods and beyond. 
The monitors were to be a part of a one-year study to compare the amount of air pollution and health impacts to a previous study done in the early 2000s that found levels of a number of cancer-causing pollutants to be unacceptable high. Mudd said the study’s start date was “imminent” before the grant was terminated.
Terry Johnson, a spokesperson for the EPA regional office that covers Kentucky, in a statement said the EPA was reviewing all awarded grants “to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities.” 
“Maybe the Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment,” Johnson said in his statement. 
Johnson did not answer emailed follow-up questions from the Lantern asking what specific issues the agency had with the grant. 
Rep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, who represents parts of West Louisville neighborhoods in the state legislature, said he hoped the city would exhaust all resources “to ensure that their mission isn’t hindered by any changes — this sort of whiplash of changes — that we see coming from the federal government.”
“Environmental justice is a freedom issue, and if you don’t have a high quality of air, you aren’t free to breathe and live a quality of life,” Watkins told the Lantern. “Clean air is nonpartisan. You need it if you’re Republican, you need it if you’re a Democrat.”

Watkins, who noted city residents in predominantly Black neighborhoods in West Louisville have significantly lower life expectancies compared to the east half of the city, questioned why the air toxics monitoring study wouldn’t align with the EPA’s mission of protecting human health and the environment. 
“What neighborhoods align, I guess, with the EPA mission?” he said. “If not for the residents of West Louisville who have documented evidence of significantly worse health outcomes, why would we not focus on those citizens?”
The air monitoring study was a piece of a larger project addressing the health impacts of air pollution, involving other community partners including the University of Louisville’s Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, the West Jefferson County Community Task Force, Park DuValle Community Health Centers and Louisville’s public health and wellness department. 
UofL researchers planned to conduct a wastewater sampling study alongside the air toxics monitoring study and collect data from both to determine “community health risks”; Park DuValle Community Health Centers would use the health impact findings from the project to train health professionals on how to treat exposure to air pollution; and the West Jefferson Community Task Force would hold community meetings to provide feedback on the project’s findings and policy recommendations.
Arnita Gadson, the executive director of the West Jefferson County Community Task Force, told the Lantern she was especially interested in how the “much needed” project planned to help inform community health workers and doctors on how to treat the impacts of exposure to air pollution. She said the health impacts of air pollution can also extend beyond West Louisville, given that residents impacted by pollution can move elsewhere and bring their health issues with them. 
“This grant was to help everybody,” Gadson said. “I think we were on the precipice of actually establishing a platform that meant that doctors really could start using some of this.” 
Attempts on Wednesday to reach the CEO of Park DuValle Community Health Centers and a key UofL researcher involved with the project were not successful. 
Eboni Cochran, the co-director of the grassroots organization Rubbertown Emergency ACTion that seeks to push back against pollution from industries in Rubbertown, told the Lantern while the termination of the grant was sad, APCD could do more to address immediate air pollution impacts. Cochran pointed to ongoing complaints of dust and fires at an industrial plant in the Parkland neighborhood of Louisville. 
“An important part of what they were doing was to engage medical professionals, right? I think that is vital to the work of environmental justice,” Cochran said. “However, you can even prevent or reduce people’s likelihood of them even having to get to the medical professional if you listened to the people who live near these industries.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1088-1024x695.jpg,,,2025-05-01 06:01:37.501899

(Audrey Carleton/Capital & Main)
This story was originally published by Capital & Main.
Just beyond a fenced-off access road in fields of tall grass on public land in Pennsylvania’s northwest sits a natural gas well pad that sat idle for close to a decade. The old fracking site suddenly roared back to life in 2022, spewing noise and pollution and rattling residents who were used to hunting pheasant on the quiet, bucolic terrain.
Diversified Energy turned on the well pad, known as Longhorn Pad A, to funnel the natural gas into on-site generators powering cryptocurrency-mining supercomputers that churn away at numbers at all hours . The company set up and started the mine in Elk County without securing a required air quality permit from state regulators, Capital & Main reported last year.
Now, after a little more than two years, the company has packed up and left, abandoning the wells and associated crypto infrastructure in violation of state law, according to state regulators.
Diversified Energy, which disputes the state’s finding that it abandoned the wells, has billed itself as innovative, giving new life to aging, low-producing gas wells that would otherwise be uneconomical to operate. Cryptocurrency aids that goal: It allows the company to monetize wells that lack pipeline infrastructure that is typically crucial to selling gas.

Pennsylvania has an estimated 350,000 orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells, more than any other state.

The company has, in just a few years, amassed a portfolio of wells bigger than that of any of its peers in the U.S., many of those wells low-producing, despite evidence that Diversified may not have adequate resources to plug them all at the end of their lives. This has stoked concerns among environmentalists about who will be on the hook for cleanup should the company abandon them. When a wellhead crypto mine suddenly shuts down it raises a host of new concerns, chief among them: What happens when operators decide it’s time to move on without plugging the wells?
Worries about the long-term environmental costs have mounted in Appalachian and other oil and gas-producing communities across the country. Diversified appears eager to try to squeeze a few more years’ profits out of old wells by burning the remaining gas to power energy-hungry computers. But they have shown less zeal when it comes to safely closing them, often shirking their obligations to plug them to prevent the ongoing release of greenhouse gas pollution.
Companies abandon wells when they walk away from them without plugging them after they are no longer lucrative, increasing the likelihood that they will be left to leak planet-warming methane gas into the atmosphere for years to come. Abandoning wells violates the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Act and saddles states with the cost and responsibility of plugging them. Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the U.S. oil industry, has an estimated 350,000 orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells, more than any other state and responsible for close to 8% of the state’s methane emissions.

The wells, which sit atop a pad called Longhorn A on state game lands in rural Horton township, were drilled under the ownership of another natural gas company, EQT, in 2011, but sat inactive for all those years, considered abandoned by regulators. Diversified Energy brought them back to life in December 2022. The company applied for a permit for generators to power cryptocurrency mining equipment atop the pad but didn’t wait to receive them from state regulators before firing up the loud and polluting equipment.
Capital & Main reported last year that the firm was unresponsive to questions from state agencies about its plans with the well pad, even as residents raised concerns about noise and its threat to neighbors and wildlife. The company received its permit to add crypto-mining equipment to the well pad in December 2023.
A Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection inspector visited the well pad earlier this year to find the cryptocurrency mining equipment gone. Inspectionreports from a March 4 visit show metallic sheds sitting empty on the gravel well pad.
The department issued Diversified a notice of violation for abandoning the well on March 10, requesting a response from the company within two weeks.
Daniel O. Frick, a director in the Environmental Health, Safety Regulatory Department at Diversified Energy, told regulators in a March 18 email that “technically the site isn’t abandoned,” and that the company plans to resume pulling gas from the well.

Plugging an oil well can cost more than $100,000, so it’s common for operators to try to avoid those obligations.

Regulators have also accused the Birmingham, Alabama-based company of violating a consent order and agreement when it abandoned Longhorn A. In the 2021 agreement that company representatives signed when it acquired the wells from fracking company EQT, Diversified agreed to plug them and 13 others at the end of their lives.
Diversified Energy did not respond to Capital & Main’s requests for comment.
State officials aren’t the only ones concerned. Environmental advocates have warned for years about the environmental risks of Diversified Energy’s large portfolio of low-producing wells across Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. They now fear abandonment of wells snatched up by the company across Appalachia for short-term windfalls will leave the public with the long-term costs of closure and cleanup.
“Diversified must not be allowed to walk away and leave others to clean up its mess,” said Charles McPhedran, senior attorney at Earthjustice, an environmental law nonprofit. McPhedran has previously urged regulators not to issue Diversified a permit for crypto mining at the site, citing noise concerns and the company’s unaddressed environmental violations.
Dave Gustafson, deputy executive director of the Pennsylvania Game Commission, which regulates and leases out the state game lands on which Longhorn A sits, said the agency “wouldn’t consider these wells ‘abandoned’” and that the company had “not expressed their plans to move forward with production nor have they indicated they intend to plug the well.”
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection disagrees.
“The wells are not equipped for production,” Tom Decker, a department spokesperson, told Capital & Main in an email. “Diversified’s claim that the wells are still equipped is contrary to the Department’s observations during the recent inspection and has not been further verified by Diversified.”
The department has given the company until September to plug the wells.
Plugging a well can cost more than $100,000, so it’s common for operators to try to avoid those obligations, said Ted Boettner, senior researcher at the nonprofit think tank Ohio River Valley Institute.
They “lift the well and get it to produce some puffs of gas and say, ‘We’re back in our active status,’ and they won’t check for another 10 years,” Boettner said.

Diversified one of many natural gas companies throwing its weight behind the coming AI boom.

A 2022 report by the Ohio River Valley Institute argued Diversified Energy was operating with “a business model built to fail Appalachia” because it relied on obtaining aging wells from other operators and squeezing the value out of them before the end of their useful lives, all without having “enough funds to plug its entire inventory of assets.”
In doing so, Diversified has acquired the largest portfolio of low-producing wells in Appalachia, which the Institute researchers wrote could become a “wave of soon-to-be-orphaned wells that could be offloaded onto the public.”
In recent months there have been new doubts raised about the company’s commitment to well-plugging. In December, Diversified reached a settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by West Virginia landowners who argued the company had abandoned wells on their properties; it agreed to plug nearly 3,000 wells across Appalachia by 2034. Within the first two weeks of January, the Department of Environmental Protection slapped Diversified with 11 notices of violation for abandoning shale gas wells in Pennsylvania.
Boettner said the state should do more to penalize the practice of abandoning wells. Without strong enforcement, he said, “We’re going to end up left with all of these wells to plug. There’s nothing stopping them.”
Meanwhile, even as it is walking away from well pads, Diversified is expanding its offerings. Just days after inspectors visited Longhorn A, Diversified announced a large-scale partnership with fuel cell company FuelCell Energy and energy infrastructure company TESIAC to power a growing industry of off-grid data centers using natural gas from fracking wells and coal mines. It’s one of many natural gas companies throwing its weight behind the coming AI boom, threatening to prolong the life of polluting industries.
But the Longhorn A well abandonments raise questions about the company’s ability to care for such projects at the end of their lives, as a broader data boom raises concerns among environmentalists about air pollution. The company has also applied for state grants for well-plugging elsewhere in Pennsylvania, according to records Capital & Main obtained under Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know Law.
Diversified CEO Rusty Hutson Jr. bought his first set of oil and gas wells in 2001 as a personal investment, taking out a home equity loan to afford a package of 35 wells that his father, a third-generation oil and gas worker, found in a deal, he said in a 2023 interview with Mountaineer Media.
“We’d go out in cold, heat, fix leaks, work on wells together,” Hutson said. “And I did that for two or three years before we started really growing the company.”
As it has added new wells to its portfolio, Diversified has written into its balance sheets lower-than-industry-standard asset retirement obligations — or estimates for the cost of plugging and closing off wells at the end of their lives.
The strategy has alarmed environmentalists, who fear the company is, at best, giving a lifeline to wells in need of decommissioning and, at worst, creating a massive taxpayer liability should it go under.










“The only thing they can do is keep buying wells, and as long as they don’t have to be accountable for those liabilities, it works.” ~ Ted Boettner, senior researcher, Ohio River Valley Institute


But Hutson is proud of his firm’s unique strategy. While most oil and gas companies focus on drilling new assets, Diversified keeps its eyes on their leftovers.
“Our game is acquiring existing mature production, operating it more efficiently than everyone else would, driving costs down, enhancing production on wells that hadn’t been given much time, or attention, or capital, driving margins and then paying dividends to our shareholders,” he told Mountaineer Media.
The company was listed only on the London Stock Exchange until December 2023, when it went public in the U.S. on the New York Stock Exchange.
That same day, House Democrats opened a probe into the firm’s practices and emissions.
“Diversified Energy is responsible for remediating a substantial share of the country’s aging oil and gas wells, but we are concerned that your company may be vastly underestimating well cleanup costs,” members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote in a letter to Hutson. The company responded at the time, saying its business model is based on “stewardship” that includes “delivering well retirement and reclamation efforts.”
Boettner estimates that all but a small fraction of the vast trove of old wells Diversified has acquired in recent years are “totally uneconomical,” and one of his reports found that more than half could, by some definitions, be classified as “inactive.” In 2022, the company offloaded a set of 2,500 of them in Ohio. In January 2024, the company sold another part of its stake in Appalachia.
“They’re able to squeeze out this money in these assets because of economies of scale,” Boettner said. “The only thing they can do is keep buying wells, and as long as they don’t have to be accountable for those liabilities, it works.”
On the ground in Horton township, home to Longhorn A, local supervisor PJ Piccirillo said he’s heard nothing from Diversified staff about their plans to abandon the wells and remove the associated crypto mine. He believes the company stopped running the well pad after the township issued an ordinance setting noise and light pollution limits on Bitcoin mines in 2023, shortly before the state issued Longhorn A its permit.
“The generators had been pulled and those big tanks had been pulled out,” he said.
Without any communication from the company, Piccirillo is concerned about future industrial development. He runs into abandoned wells in his corner of Elk County often that, he said, “I don’t know if anybody knows about.” The township lacks jurisdiction over well abandonment, so there’s nothing he can do about them from his position as a supervisor.
“All we know is that that property seems to have been abandoned,” he said of Longhorn A. “What might be next?”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LNGH-scaled-1-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-05-01 06:01:37.501899

House Bill 171 bans mandatory DEI training, consideration of diversity and equity in hiring, dedicated DEI offices or positions and the use of any taxpayer dollars on the efforts. It defines DEI as anything that “promotes differential treatment” based on identity.
The measure is part of a trio of Republican-led bills wiping DEI from all corners of the public sector — government, higher education and K-12 education. It passed the House on a 69-45 vote, as protesters and visiting members of the historically Black Divine Nine fraternities and sororities looked on from the gallery.
State workers who violate the measure could be subject to removal, a fine of up to $5,000 and potential civil litigation. And the state auditor’s office, currently held by Republican Dave Boliek, would conduct “periodic” audits on agencies.
Over the course of an extensive, wide-ranging and tense debate, Republican proponents described the bill as a long-overdue return to the idea of prioritizing merit in government.
“It restores the principle that should never have been lost: can you do the job?” said House Majority Leader Brenden Jones (R-Columbus). “Did you earn it? Are you qualified?”
Democrats warned that the bill would set the state further back as it struggles to fill vacancies within government, and that it could dissuade agencies from hiring workers who could be perceived as “DEI hires.”
“Why would you want to be … somebody that sets off those alarms?” House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said. “We know that’s the effect. Don’t pretend otherwise. This makes people say, ‘it’s not worth the trouble.'”
The hours-long discussion featured lawmakers speaking on terms both broad and personal.
Rep. John Blust (R-Guilford) read passages from books he described as “seminal documents for DEI,” while remarking that the U.S. “gets a bad rap” relative to the global history of slavery. (Reives later commented that he was “happy to help with history lessons.”)
“I don’t think we’re getting an honest assessment of what DEI is from the debate opponents,” Blust said.
  Rep. Carolyn Logan (D-Mecklenburg) (Photo: NCGA video stream)
And Rep. Carolyn Logan (D-Mecklenburg) recalled being recruited as the only Black woman to serve on the NC Highway Patrol for more than a decade. And she asked who had taken issue with diversity and equity being used within the state workforce.
“Who was complaining about this? Who are the state agencies who say they were having a problem?” Logan said. “Is it going to be cookie cutter? We’re going back to all white males?”
Republicans, who control the North Carolina legislature, have made a more concentrated push against DEI efforts this session in the wake of the White House’s crackdown on those programs and practices nationally.
The legislation now goes to the Senate. Bills banning DEI in both higher education and K-12 schools have already passed that chamber and are awaiting further action in the House.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_8143-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 06:01:37.501899

People behind bars labor every day — cooking, cleaning, maintaining prison facilities, even fighting wildfires. Yet unlike other workers, they have few rights, are paid pennies or nothing at all, and are without access to the most basic human needs and at the mercy of others with little to no recourse. 
In Colorado, people in prison can be denied family visitation — calls, video chats, or in-person visits — if they choose not to participate in a prison work program. This practice is cruel, coercive, and completely out of step with the values May Day represents.
The Right to Family and Community Connection Act, House Bill 25-1013, would enshrine the right to family visitation as a matter of law — one that cannot be stripped away for refusing to work.

Prison labor is already a form of economic injustice. But when you tie a worker’s ability to see their children or speak to a parent to their willingness to work under these conditions, it’s not just economic coercion, it’s inhumane. 
Coloradans — regardless of party — know that family isn’t a reward. It’s a lifeline. It’s also one of the most powerful tools for rehabilitation. Research shows that people in prison who maintain strong family bonds are less likely to reoffend and more likely to successfully reintegrate into society. 
This isn’t just smart public policy. It’s basic humanity. 
We don’t have to look far to see the human cost. David Turner, a 24-year-old father of two, was placed on Restrictive Privileges status for “failure to work” — punished after being marked absent on days he wasn’t scheduled and for a shift he missed while receiving medical care. For 43 days, David was confined 22 hours a day, cut off from his family — not even allowed to send letters to his children. 
As David put it, “Getting out of prison and back to my family is very important to me, and knowing I can be kept in prison longer if I attempt to choose not to work coerces me to work against my will … I feel like a slave being forced to work against my will by CDOC. Everybody does.” 
No one should be forced to choose between enduring forced labor or losing all contact with the people they love. 
May Day reminds us that the dignity of labor must be fiercely protected — and that includes the dignity of those whose rights are denied and whose voices are often silenced.
This May Day, let’s extend our solidarity to all workers, including those behind prison walls. Let’s fight for fair wages, safe conditions, and freedom from retaliation — and for the fundamental human right to stay connected to the people we love. 
Every person — no matter where they are – needs the right to stay connected to their loved ones without fear of retaliation or exploitation. The Right to Family and Community Connection Act would guarantee that right.

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)From last year to now, Virginia raised teacher pay by an average of $3,000. Still, the commonwealth’s average pay rate for educators remains stagnant compared to other states, according to the latest salary report published by the National Education Association.
The commonwealth dropped by one spot to 26th, paying teachers an average of $66,327, an increase from a year ago. Virginia’s average teacher pay is $5,703 below the national average of $72,030, the NEA report states.
Education leaders and lawmakers in the commonwealth said inflation and investments are some of the factors contributing to mixed results in the national salary report.
“Clearly (the report) shows that we have made good improvement in recent years, and we have a long way to go,” said House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke. 
Rasoul admitted that the commonwealth is thousands of dollars below the national teacher pay average, “but when we started this journey a few years ago, we were in the bottom third of states, and so we’re approaching where we need to be.”
The Virginia Education Association (VEA), representing the largest group of K-12 teachers in the commonwealth, said that while the national data shows gains have been made in Virginia, pre-kindergarten to higher education teachers are still not making enough to support themselves after being adjusted for inflation.
According to VEA, the average public school teacher salary increased by 3% from the previous year, but when adjusted for inflation, teachers made only $108 more.
“While it might look like teachers are getting support, they are actually losing money, which has a direct impact on student learning,” VEA said.
While recognizing recent gains, VEA president Carol Bauer said Virginia’s teachers are “still losing economic ground” while schools continue weathering the state’s education staffing shortages.
“True historic investment means decisively closing salary gaps, adequately funding schools, and ensuring every classroom has a qualified teacher. Virginia must commit to real, sustained investments to attract and retain educators, rather than relying on incremental gains that barely keep pace with inflation,” Bauer said.
 What can Virginia do now?

Virginia has an opportunity to boost educator pay even more, after the General Assembly recommended changes to the state budget.
This week, Gov. Glenn Youngkin will decide whether to support lawmakers’ budget proposal to provide bonuses to teachers and lift a cap on state funding for non-instructional school staff positions. This would give school divisions greater flexibility to hire the staff they need without being “restricted” by outdated student-to-staff ratios.
In 2009, during the Great Recession, lawmakers initiated the cap to reduce state spending on non-instructional school staff positions, including central office and administrative, technical, clerical, maintenance, and instructional support positions.
The governor’s office did not immediately respond to comment on the report. However, in the governor’s budget recommendations in March, Youngkin wrote that Virginia has raised teacher pay by 18% over the last three years.
The budget amendments now being considered by the governor contain $166 million more for public education, including $84.7 million to raise the cap.
Last year, state lawmakers formed a joint committee to work on overhauling the Standards of Quality (SOQ), the state’s funding formula determining the financial needs of school divisions, after a state study group found local governments have been shouldering a disproportionate share of K-12 education costs compared to the state’s contributions.
Lawmakers arranged for the state and localities to pay an even split of contributions in 1972, but they changed it in 1993, urging localities to start paying for K-12 fringe benefits.
According to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the state’s share was established at 55%, while localities paid 45%.
 What’s next?

House Education Committee Vice Chair Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, carried the support cap bill and budget language to support non-instructional positions.
As a former teacher and school board member, Simonds said a core issue her legislation will address is the administration’s prioritized focus on overhauling testing and accountability measures — part of the administration’s efforts to combat learning loss and raise student testing scores — instead of recruiting and maintaining teachers.
Virginia’s learning recovery falls short as NAEP scores show mixed results

Simonds said some ways to make teaching the best job in Virginia could involve creating competitive pay, treating educators as professionals in the school buildings, and offering maternity leave, professional development and planning periods to collaborate with colleagues.
“The only thing that has been really proven to improve education is highly qualified teachers,” Simonds said. “Having a highly qualified teacher in every classroom is the way we move the needle on test scores for our children.”

(Photo courtesy of Meals on Wheels of Chesapeake)Some sad – and also hopeful – truths emerge every time Meals on Wheels volunteers deliver nutritious food to disabled residents and senior citizens around Virginia, as my wife and I have done in Chesapeake over the past two years. The national program is now under a pointless attack in Washington, putting thousands in the commonwealth at risk of missing the meals and social connections they rely on.
Plan to axe SNAP would harm poorest Americans so richest ones could live more luxuriously

Plenty of Meals on Wheels recipients have so many mobility and other health-related problems that just reaching the front door is a hurdle. A sizable number would strain or exhaust their budgets without the sustenance from these low-cost or free meals. A huge portion of recipients – 67% in Chesapeake over a recent three-month period – live alone and crave the brief interaction from the program’s 500-plus volunteers.
The hopeful part? The program’s 26 chapters statewide ease social isolation and are a daily wellness check. Meals on Wheels is a key factor in allowing the elderly to stay in their homes longer. The nonprofit organization provides dignity and connection for people who worked for decades and now need some help to survive in their twilight years.
Nearly 13,000 Virginians received just under 2.3 million meals through Meals on Wheels in 2024, a spokesman with the Virginia Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services told me.
So I’m aghast that the current White House and supine Republican members of Congress want to cleave the program as part of the Trump administration’s downsizing of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as The New York Times reported last week.
The Administration for Community Living is a small government agency responsible for overseeing programs including Meals on Wheels. It would be dismantled under the administration’s proposed budget in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Already, about half of the staff has been laid off, The Times said.
“It’s heartbreaking to think of seniors hungry and without social support,” said Megan Mann, executive director of Meals on Wheels of Chesapeake. She’s had to start a waiting list for the first time.
Meals on Wheels typically receives money from federal, state and local government and private donors. In Chesapeake, for example, Mann said the current operating budget is $477,000. Some 20% of revenue comes from the feds. The biggest portion, 56.5%, comes from the private sector – foundation grants, individual donations, faith and civic groups, and more.
That means local communities do their part to keep the chapters running. The federal portion, though, is a significant amount of the revenue stream.
The proposed federal cuts are yet another noxious development from this administration, coming on the heels of possible reductions to food stamps, Medicaid and Head Start. President Trump and his minions are determined to decimate programs targeted to the most vulnerable and least politically connected.
Virginia weighs response to potential Medicaid rollbacks affecting 630,000

That’s not a coincidence.
Call it fiscal irresponsibility, especially at a time when the administration wants to extend tax cuts that would overwhelmingly help the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Programs on the chopping block, though, have shown their viability and cost benefits over the long term. Bean counters in Washington should recognize that.
For example, a review of studies about Meals on Wheels found the programs “improve diet quality and increase nutrient intakes among participants.” 
As The Washington Post reported years ago, when the budget chief early in Trump’s first term criticized the program, Meals on Wheels was instead cited as being “aligned with the federal cost-containment policy to rebalance long-term care away from nursing homes to home- and community-based services by helping older adults maintain independence.”
We shouldn’t ignore the human side, either. Its value is intangible, yet it means something to allow people to live with self-respect and the familiarity of their own homes for as long as possible. It’s more cost-effective, too.
I’m thinking of the Navy veteran living in Chesapeake, a widower, who’s recovering from back surgery and welcomed chatting a while with The Boss (my nickname for my wife, the one in charge). Or the man who was exceedingly gracious when I dropped off food last week, in spite of his health issues. He uses oxygen and a walker just to get around the house.
Sharon Adams is a retired nurse who’s been receiving Meals on Wheels fare for more than three years. She grapples with high blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension and bipolar disorder. The 62-year-old counts on the program.
“It’s a reassurance in the back of my mind that the need will be met,” Adams told me. She still pays rent, utilities and car insurance, but Adams has one fewer bill to worry about. “This gives me peace.”
Her favorite item from Meals on Wheels? Chicken stir fry. “It’s so good!” she told me. “I actually put hearts on the (menu) calendar the day I know it’s coming.”
“It’s a good program,” Adams continued. “It would be a shame if the government completely wiped it out.”
Then there’s 96-year-old Willie Cahoon. The Army veteran has enjoyed a varied life, working at Sears in electronic and electrical tasks, at an auto parts store, and running a marine repair business. He once owned a Cessna plane.
He’s outlived two wives. Cahoon still lives in the home he and his first wife built in 1965. His daughters live in the area, but Cahoon would love to stay in his own home as long as possible. Meals on Wheels helps him do that, and it’s a step up from the frozen dinners he often ate  before joining the program. 
When Meals on Wheels volunteers visit, “That is the high point of each day,” he told me. “I got to know so many of them. Those volunteers are special people.”
So is the program.
Our federal government can afford to do its share. The benefits outweigh the costs, and the elderly and disabled who depend on Meals on Wheels don’t deserve the unnecessary uncertainty emanating from D.C.

(Courtesy of Idaho National Laboratory)Officials with the state of Idaho and the U.S. Department of Energy have agreed to a waiver of the state’s 1995 nuclear waste settlement agreement, the two sides announced Tuesday.
The new waiver will allow for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for the purposes of conducting research at Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho, officials said.
The waiver specifically allows for a high burnup nuclear fuel cask from the North Anna Power Station, a commercial nuclear power plant located in Virginia, to be sent to Idaho National Laboratory for research, according to a press release issued Tuesday.

The waiver was necessary because the 1995 settlement agreement called for limiting shipments of, and removing certain types of, spent nuclear fuel in Idaho.
“The collaborative effort between the state of Idaho, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Idaho National Laboratory showcases our commitment to advancing nuclear energy research while upholding the goals of the 1995 Settlement Agreement,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a written statement.
“We are proud to support innovation in nuclear energy that will support national security and energy independence into the future.”
 Research at INL to support licensing for extended storage of spent fuel at nuclear power plants

Idaho National Laboratory, or INL, is one of 17 Department of Energy national labs, and it employs or contacts with about 6,400 researchers and support staff.
Much of the nuclear research and energy research conducted by Idaho National Laboratory occurs at a vast research complex referred to as “the site” that is located in the eastern Idaho desert, between the town of Arco and Idaho Falls.





“Idaho National Laboratory is DOE’s lead lab for nuclear energy research and development, and it is critical that we continue to grow this research capacity and maintain American competitiveness,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a written statement. “This agreement between the State of Idaho and DOE ensures the lab can continue its cutting-edge research to advance nuclear technology, helping to meet President Trump’s commitment to unleash American energy dominance.”
In today’s press release, state and federal officials said the research will provide data to support licensing for the extended storage of spent fuel at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states.
“As the nation’s center for nuclear energy research and development, we look forward to utilizing our unique facilities and expertise to support this critical national need,” Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said in a written statement. “We are thankful to the Department of Energy and the state of Idaho for entrusting us with the safe and secure execution of our vital mission.”
 1995 settlement agreement came after environmental, health concerns from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho

As part of the new waiver, Idaho National Laboratory will also be allowed to safely manage small amounts of spent nuclear fuel from domestic university reactors. Without the waiver, some U.S. universities could have been forced to shut down their research reactors due to limits on spent fuel storage, officials said.
Signed in October 1995 by then-Gov. Phil Batt, the 1995 settlement agreement resolved a lawsuit filed by the state amid public concern about the environmental and health risks resulting from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho. The lawsuit was filed in order to keep Idaho from becoming a dumping ground for the country’s spent nuclear fuel, according to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.
The new waiver relaxes the annual limit on the amount of spent nuclear fuel and materials that can come into Idaho, officials said.
The fuel cask is just under 17 feet tall and is just over eight feet in diameter. During storage, it weighs about 105 metric tons, or 231,000 pounds, officials said.
The cask would be shipped by train, and shipment could occur in 2027 under the waiver.

,DC,2025-05-01 09:10:18+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Three-quarters of Americans oppose Medicaid cuts, poll shows",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-quarters-americans-oppose-medicaid-cuts-poll-shows,,"WASHINGTON — A majority of Americans, including most Republicans, oppose major cuts in federal funding for Medicaid, according to a poll released Thursday by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.The survey shows that 76% of those questioned wouldn’t support  Congress slashing the amount of spending dedicated to the state-federal health program for lower-income Americans and some people with disabilities.Democrats held the highest rate of opposition at 95%. A small majority of Republicans surveyed, 55%, said they don’t support substantial federal spending cuts for the program.The breakdown was nearly even among respondents who identified as Make America Great Again supporters — President Donald Trump’s base — with 51% of that group saying they support less federal funding for Medicaid and 49% saying they oppose major cuts to the federal allocation.The survey comes just days before House Republicans are expected to release a bill that will likely propose cutting hundreds of billions in federal funding for Medicaid.That legislation, as well as bills from several other committees, is supposed to help Republicans offset some of the $4.5 trillion deficit impact that comes with extending the 2017 tax law.The KFF poll also showed strong opposition to slashing federal funding to other health care programs — 74% were against cuts to states for mental health and addiction prevention services, 71% didn’t support reducing federal spending to track infectious disease outbreaks, 69% opposed limiting federal dollars for research at universities and medical centers, 65% were against cuts to HIV prevention program allocations and 65% didn’t support reducing federal funding to help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.Polling of 1,380 U.S. adults took place from April 8 to April 15 via telephone and online. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.Senate GOP watching House actionSenate Republicans are closely watching how their House colleagues restructure federal funding for Medicaid, and will likely propose changes when the entire 11-bill package comes over from the House later this year.Several GOP senators told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday they will judge the package based on how changes to Medicaid will impact their constituents.Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said he’s unlikely to support any changes to Medicaid that “will result in cutting benefits or denying eligibility for people who are otherwise working.”

“I'm all for work requirements,” he said. “I don't think you get any Republican objection to that.”But Hawley said going beyond that might be pressing the issue too far to get his vote.""I just met with the governor of my state this morning. He's in town. We just sat down and we talked about this issue,"" Hawley said, adding that Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, was “very worried about” potential changes to federal Medicaid funding.Maine Sen. Susan Collins said she’s planning to evaluate the House bill once it makes it through that chamber based on “the impact on low-income seniors who are dual eligible, families with children with disabilities, low-income families, our rural hospitals, healthcare providers.”Dual eligibility refers to people who are on Medicare and Medicaid.“I am open to carefully crafted work requirements for able-bodied adults who do not have preschool children,” Collins said. “But I have no idea what the package is going to contain at this point.”Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran said he’s told his chamber’s Republican leadership that “Medicaid is an important issue” for him in determining whether he votes for the entire package once it’s on the floor.“I’m going to look at overall how it impacts citizens, particularly people with disabilities, and how it impacts my state and the hospitals that provide services to people in Kansas,” Moran said.North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said “the challenge is going to be to find savings in line with what the president has described.”“He said he doesn't want any cuts to Medicaid,” Hoeven said. “But how do you make sure that you eliminate waste, fraud and abuse? And that the folks that should be getting it are getting it, rather than an able-bodied person who should be out there working and is able to do that and take care of themselves.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-05-01 06:01:37.501899

Aaron Dana testifies in support of prohibiting eminent domain on tribal lands before the Judiciary Committee on April 4, 2025. (Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The Judiciary Committee advanced legislation on Wednesday to prevent the state from being able to seize Wabanki land for public use without consultation, though amended it in a way that appears to assuage at least some of the concerns raised by Gov. Janet Mills’ administration. 
The committee voted 10-4 in favor of an amended version of LD 958, incorporating a proposed amendment from the Maine State Chamber of Commerce that the prohibition would only apply to current tribal trust lands, meaning land for which the federal government holds the legal title of on behalf of a tribe, and not land that may be put into trust in the future. 
Earlier in April, the governor came out in opposition to the bill, with her legal counsel citing the inability to predict the future needs of state government and uncertainty over the future location of tribal trust land, as the Wabanaki Nations are still eligible to acquire more under the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. 
This thinking was why some on the committee did not back the plan. Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot) said he cast an opposing vote because he believes the power of seizing private property for public use, a principle known as eminent domain, is vital for government to properly function. 
The vote did not fall along party lines. Haggan was among the three Republicans who voted against the legislation — also including Reps. Rachel Henderson of Rumford and Mark Babin of Fort Fairfield — with Democratic Rep. Dani O’Halloran of Brewer joining them in opposition. 
While the Judiciary Committee may often be known to complicate matters, Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), who voted for the legislation, argued this issue is straightforward.
“Our relationship with the Tribes is a government relationship and we should not be able to take their land, full stop,” said Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn).
The relationship between the Wabanaki Nations and the state is complicated by the 1980 Settlement Act, which has overall resulted in the Wabanaki Nations being treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations.
LD 958 is the next piecemeal change lawmakers and Wabanaki leaders are seeking to make to afford the Tribes greater sovereignty. While incremental alterations to the Settlement Act have been made in recent years, sweeping change has so far failed due to opposition from Mills, a Democrat. 
Mills did not respond to a request for comment about the amendment by the time of publication. 
The U.S. government’s authority to exercise eminent domain is restricted by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which requires just compensation for land taken, as well as some federal laws.
The 1834 federal Indian Nonintercourse Act prohibited land transactions with tribes unless authorized by Congress. However, the Settlement Act specified that that federal law was not applicable to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation.
LD 958 would amend the Settlement Act to prohibit the state from exercising eminent domain on current trust and reservation land, which is protected under federal law, though fee land — private property for which the owner owns the title — would still be subject to the state taking.
The bill would also amend the 2023 Mi’kmaq Nation Restoration Act to make this change for the Mi’kmaq Nation, which wasn’t included in the Settlement Act.
As advanced by the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, the bill was also amended at the request of Wabanaki leaders to remove the portion that had stipulated how the Tribes could reacquire land with such proceeds, which Passamaquoddy attorney Corey Hinton criticized as a paternalistic process. Instead, the bill now simply points to the federal takings process.
LD 958 now heads to the Maine House of Representatives and Senate for floor votes.

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
Fast-building states get more babies

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Apartment construction cools rents in some regions

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.

– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America


Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

And it’s even more remarkable (and troubling) when the leaders doing the sharing are all women and the officials blocking action are all men.
But that’s what happened this week at the state legislature when a trio of female lawmakers who are also breast cancer survivors demanded action on legislation that would require health insurance companies to cover the cost of diagnostic imaging for the disease.
Amazingly, many insurers don’t cover those tests and even more amazingly, the male legislators who run the General Assembly have repeatedly blocked bipartisan bills to require it.
It’s an outrageous situation that, as Senator Val Applewhite of Cumberland County rightfully observed, should leave all women, quote “as mad as hell.”
The bottom line: The all-male crew behind the breast cancer screening blockade should be ashamed. Let’s hope their mothers, wives and daughters let them know about it.

The sweeping legislation aims to encourage investment in new power generation by building a moat around the market and offering tax incentives to new entrants.
Meanwhile the distribution utilities on the outside looking in will get similar tax breaks for new transmission infrastructure, as well as a ratemaking overhaul. For those so-called pole-and-wire companies, some changes are welcome. Others a bit less so.
The legislation equips the ratemaking process with a statutory ‘shot clock’ to keep deliberations to about a year at most. Utilities will also get to set rates for three years at a time, so long as there’s an annual “true up” of charges and expenses. But a system they’ve relied on for years to avoid full rate cases is going away. So is the controversial coal plant subsidy approved as part of 2019’s House Bill 6.

The legislation amounts to a substantial reworking of the state’s energy marketplace, but at least in the near term, it’s unlikely to address the concerns that drove a bipartisan coalition of backers to approve it.
The 13-state energy grid operator PJM predicts energy demand will surpass its supply in the next few years. At the same time, it’s struggling to get new power plants plugged into its system. Some leaders point to so-called behind-the-meter generation — small, purpose-built power plants for individual customers — as a potential short-term answer to the problem. Others suggest if the line with PJM is too long, maybe it’s time to look for a different line.
Senate debate
In the Senate, state Sen. Brian Chavez, R-Marietta, spoke in support of House Bill 15. Earlier this week, lawmakers tacked on several tweaks hammered out in negotiations with the House.
“In essence,” Chavez argued, “it reduces the barriers to entry for power generation, it increases the flow of investments into the state, and it makes Ohio more competitive for industries, while stimulating job creation and economic development.”
He also highlighted one important compromise. Instead of eliminating a tax on machinery and equipment, the final version reduced the tax from 25% to 7%.
State Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, urged lawmakers to revisit provisions left out of the final bill. He argued Ohio should launch a pilot program for community solar, saying lessons can be learned “in a small scale first, so we can help develop this across the state of Ohio.”
But most important, Smith applauded the measure for finally turning the page on H.B. 6.
“House Bill 15 contains huge wins for consumers that have been scarred by the House Bill 6 scandal,” he said. “But most importantly, it will keep money in the pockets of hardworking Ohioans as we end the legacy generation rider, which is costing Ohio ratepayers over $450,000 a day.”
The Senate put the proposal to a vote quickly and approved it unanimously.
Speaking after the vote, Senate President Rob McColley emphasized the importance of behind-the-meter generation. He argued the policy could be “one of the most transformational” changes state lawmakers make in the energy sector. McColley said he’s already hearing from companies that believe it will dramatically reduce the time it takes to get up and running. He added the policy could also offer a way for some power producers to sidestep the PJM backlog.
“Eventually some of these projects, once they’re built behind-the-meter, will file an application at PJM to interconnect,” McColley said. “They will not need permission to interconnect before they can build because they won’t be interconnected yet, but the ultimate goal could be that they generate enough power to send it out onto the grid.”
House debate
Across the rotunda, House sponsor state Rep. Roy Klopfenstein, R-Haviland, praised the legislation as a “great step” toward making Ohio “energy independent.”
“We know that PJM has issued significant warnings throughout the last few years,” he said, “that we are heading towards an energy shortage crisis across the entire market — as soon as next year.”
The House overwhelmingly approved the measure, by a vote of 94-2.
Speaking afterward, House Speaker Matt Huffman echoed McColley’s praise for behind-the-meter generation. He argued giving large power users an alternative will reduce their impact on the grid and give the system greater flexibility overall.
“What that does is make sure there’s more reliable energy, and with fewer users on the grid, the cost goes down,” he said. “So that’s hopefully the immediate effect.”
But far from suggesting the approach could help generators sidestep a long interconnection queue with PJM, Huffman floated the idea of sidestepping PJM altogether.
“Is PJM the right fit for the state of Ohio?” Huffman wondered. “There’s another choice, MISO, to the West, which includes Indiana and much of the Big 10 — or the old Big 10 when there was only 10 schools in it.”
Huffman said he’s already begun talking with people at MISO. The 15-state grid operator covers much of the Midwest, and stretches as far south as Mississippi and Louisiana and as far west as the Dakotas and part of Montana.
The speaker complained about PJM agreeing to changes sought by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro that “restrict the free market.”
Shapiro sued PJM arguing the price cap at an upcoming auction was too high, and customers in his state could see bills increase $21 billion over the next two years. PJM settled, and federal regulators signed off on the agreement earlier this month.
“That gives me, personally, great pause,” Huffman said. “Is that PJM board acting in the best interest of all of the members, including the state of Ohio? So, we need to ask that question that may help us some on the future issues.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)At 16 beds, Colebrook’s Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital is the smallest licensed hospital in New Hampshire.
“We call it ‘frontier medicine,’” Tom Mee, CEO of the hospital’s parent company, North Country Health, said. “It’s the lifeblood of health care for that community.”
Situated in rural northern Coös County near the U.S.-Canada border, Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital is the only hospital nearby, which makes it vital to the health and well-being of area residents.
“When an urban hospital closes or cuts back programs, you just go to the other hospital that’s five miles away,” Mee said. “In our community, you’re driving hours.”
That’s why Mee and other rural health providers are so afraid of Republican proposals in Washington, D.C., to gut Medicaid, the country’s public health care program for those with low incomes and unique needs. They argue this move would further destabilize an already challenging rural health system.
In early April, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives voted to approve a resolution outlining the federal budget, an early step in the lengthy federal budgeting process. That outline called for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to renew President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — which his opponents and many economists decry as a tax break for the richest Americans.
The resolution tasks several legislative committees with cutting different areas of the budget. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been instructed to cut its portion by about $880 billion over 10 years. While it doesn’t explicitly specify these cuts come from Medicaid, the program comprises about $8.2 trillion of the almost $9 trillion the committee can cut from. This means, experts say, it would be impossible to do so without reducing Medicaid or Medicare. Some Republicans have proposed shrinking Medicaid by about a third over 10 years.
If that cut went into effect, an estimated 24 million people receiving Medicaid would lose their health care coverage; 10 million of those would be children. In New Hampshire, that’s 60,000 people and 30,000 children. One in 7 New Hampshire residents in total receive Medicaid, and 17.1% of all New Hampshire Medicaid recipients live in Coös County, despite the county comprising roughly 2% of the state’s population.
North Country challenges
Mee said the country must “get past this notion that getting people off Medicaid saves money.”
“There is no model where, from a taxpayer perspective, taking somebody off the Medicaid rolls is a net positive for the taxpayer,” Mee said. “In the short term, yeah, it sounds good that we’ve got somebody off the Medicaid roll or that they’re working, but the flip side of that is that these patients then become uninsured, they don’t get preventative health visits in general, and they show up in our ERs months later, sicker than they ever were before.”
Hospitals cannot turn away patients who are unable to pay like most businesses can. They are legally required — through a 1986 law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act — to provide emergency treatment to all patients who need it regardless of ability to pay. Without Medicaid, more people will be unable to pay. Hospitals are forced to absorb that cost.
Mee called it “a long-term drain on the system.”
Coös County is the state’s largest county by area (about 1,800 square miles) and its smallest by population (about 32,000 residents). The county has three hospitals — Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital, Androscoggin Valley Hospital, and Weeks Medical Center — all operated by North Country Health. All three are designated as critical access hospitals by the federal government, meaning they’re far enough from any other hospital that the government believes they’re essential to ensure that an area has access to care.
“On a perfect day, we can drive about 90 minutes between sites,” he said. “But on a snowy day, you’re talking about real life and death at that point if we have to start cutting back on services.”
Mee said that if these Medicaid cuts go into effect, North Country Health would have to consider doing so. About 15% of North Country Health’s patients are on Medicaid, he explained.
“I don’t lie awake at night worrying about our hospitals closing,” he said. “But I do worry about whether or not we’re going to continue to offer the full scope of services that we do today.”
He said the first services they’d have to consider eliminating are in women’s health, including OB-GYNs and baby deliveries, and behavioral health, including psychiatry and substance use disorder. He said the results would be disastrous.
“If we’re not able to deliver babies in Coös County, pregnant women and neonates will die,” he said. “It’s a fact.”
Mee said the health system has already eliminated every non-essential cost.
“We’ve already picked all the low-hanging fruit,” he said. “So if Medicaid reductions, or however it looks, force us to look at it again, then we’re going to have to look at something a bit more draconian than what we’ve done in the past.”

U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, who represents the North Country — as well as Nashua, Concord, and the western half of New Hampshire — said she’s worried about the viability of rural hospitals like those in the North Country and other rural parts of New Hampshire should these cuts be enacted.
“What I’m hearing from so many rural hospitals in our state is just how fragile they are,” Goodlander said. “I mean, they’re operating on the slimmest of margins.”
Fears of the trigger law in Peterborough
The congresswoman visited Monadnock Community Hospital in Peterborough, another rural critical access hospital, last week to hear from some of those health care leaders.
“We are really concerned about what’s going to happen with Medicaid,” Richard Scheinblum, executive vice president and CFO at Monadnock Community Hospital, said.

McGuire, president and CEO, is at left, and Richard Scheinblum, executive vice president and CFO, is at right. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)
In New Hampshire, the fear of federal Medicaid cuts is twofold. Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal government and states. New Hampshire has a trigger law on the books mandating that if federal funding for the expanded Medicaid program falls below 90%, the state government will revoke its portion of the funding for about 60,000 of New Hampshire’s recipients who receive coverage through the 2014 expansion.
“If expanded Medicaid blows up, that’s between a $1 to $2 million loss to us,” Scheinblum said. This figure is per year, he said, and he calculated it by examining figures from before expansion was enacted, factoring in recent market developments and updated variables.
Goodlander said she’s spoken with state lawmakers who don’t seem to understand what the impact of this trigger law being activated would be.
Cynthia McGuire, president and CEO at Monadnock Community Hospital, said the hospital isn’t sure they’d be able to continue employing the entirety of their current staff with Medicaid cuts. The hospital is one of the largest employers in Peterborough. Additionally, Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital, Androscoggin Valley Hospital, and Weeks Medical Center are the largest employers in their respective towns.
Scheinblum and McGuire said if these cuts went into effect, like North Country Health, they’d also have to look carefully at downsizing their operations.
“What I’d hope we could do is look at some alternative revenue sources or some other areas to scale back,” Scheinblum said, listing philanthropic grants and donations and partnerships with other hospitals as examples. “Everything would be on the table.”
They noted that due to their community’s financial support they’re really well positioned compared to other hospitals.
“There are a lot of hospitals in our state that will not survive,” Goodlander noted.
The hospital leaders emphasized the importance of critical access hospitals.
“We’re the last stop,” McGuire added. “We can’t shut our door and say we’re not going to take care of any more people today. That’s what we are here for.”
Uncertainty in Claremont
Matt Foster, president and CEO of Valley Regional Hospital, a critical access hospital in Claremont, said this moment feels like “December to January 2020 pre-COVID when something’s coming but you’re really not sure how to plan.”
He said the hospital has “started to think about” a contingency plan should these cuts be enacted.
“This has come on so quickly we’re kind of in the reactive phase,” he said. “It’s like Mike Tyson said, which is, ‘Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.’”
Foster noted the challenges their community faces: Roughly 15% of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. About one-third of Claremont’s population is on Medicaid.
“Finances are like oxygen,” he said. “They’re not why we’re here but they’re necessary for life.”
Foster, too, explained that Medicaid would force their hospital to make tough decisions about services, specifically on their payroll.
“We’re about as efficient as we can be,” he said. “There’s only so many things you can do that don’t rely on (employees).”
Officials at Valley Regional Hospital, which is operated by Dartmouth Health, explained that cutting Medicaid keeps people from obtaining preventative care and forces them to go to the emergency department for things that should be handled by a primary care physician. Jocelyn Caple, interim CEO of Valley Regional Hospital, likened it to “taking a water balloon, going and squeezing it.”
“It ends up somewhere else, which is not the most efficient or effective place to pay for it,” she said.
U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen spoke with Foster, Caple, and other Valley Regional Hospital officials during a visit to Claremont last week.
“You talk about uncertainty, and one of the challenges that we’ve had in Washington is also uncertainty,” Shaheen said.
Shaheen said she’s also concerned about rural New Hampshire hospitals’ ability to remain solvent amid these cuts. Asked what recourse New Hampshire Medicaid proponents have in the event that the trigger law is enacted, Shaheen, who is a former New Hampshire governor, deflected, noting it is a state-level decision, not within her jurisdiction as a federal lawmaker.
Still, she encouraged constituents to “call your legislator, call the governor, call everybody you can think of, and let them know that that’s not acceptable.”
At the same time as federal lawmakers weigh trimming Medicaid, state lawmakers are also proposing changes to the program in New Hampshire. The state Senate passed a bill —  Senate Bill 134 — in March requiring people to work in order to receive Medicaid in New Hampshire, and the House approved a plan to charge certain Medicaid recipients premiums and increase the share of prescription costs recipients are responsible for in the budget they passed in April.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office, which originally proposed the premium and prescription cost plan, and would have to sign off on work requirements for them to be enacted, did not respond to the Bulletin’s requests for comment about state or federal proposals.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shaheenrural-1024x659.jpg,,,2025-05-01 06:01:37.501899

Senate bill 754 would let schools start up to a week earlier than currently allowed. It passed the Senate with on a 39-7 vote. 
Since 2004, a law backed by the tourism industry required schools to start no earlier than the Monday closest to Aug. 26 and end no later than the Friday closest to June 11. 
Over the years, House members approved bill after bill to lift those restrictions. The Senate resisted any changes and the House bills died there.  
Local school boards have been defying the law. One quarter of the state’s 115 school districts voted last year to defy it, according to WFAE.
Sen. Amy Galey (R-Alamance) told senators the bill was a product of weeks of discussions with the NC School Boards Association and the state’s travel and tourism industry. The industry has a strong financial interest in school calendars, she said.
The change senators endorsed Wednesday would allow traditional calendar schools to open no earlier than the Monday closest to Aug. 19 and close the academic year no later than the Friday in May before Memorial Day. 
In the House, the chamber’s K-12 Education Committee on Tuesday approved repealing the calendar law with a bill allowing local school boards to decide on their own when the school year starts and ends.  The House Rules Committee was set to vote on the bill Wednesday evening, likely its last stop before it reaches the House floor. 
The Senate bill establishes the State Board of Education as a gatekeeper. It will decide whether districts deserve to open a week early. The bill includes penalties for school districts that defy the law. The board would be required to withhold financial support for districts’ central office administration until the districts comply. Individuals and businesses within school districts would be able to sue those that don’t comply with the law. Courts would be able to award claimants up to $10,000 and attorney’s fees.
It has been lawsuits in some districts that forced local boards to open schools later than they wanted. The Union County school board backed away from its plan to start school early in 2023 when two parents sued, WFAE reported. The Carteret County school board dropped its plan to appeal a court decision last year that its school calendar was illegal.

Ohio Senate Bill 86 would require intoxicating hemp products to be sold only at adult-use marijuana dispensaries instead of allowing them to be sold at CBD stores, convenience stores, smoke shops, or gas stations. The bill now moves to the Ohio House for consideration.

“Current intoxicated hemp products are untested and unregulated,” said Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City. “The bill protects buyers from gaining access to these intoxicating products and ensures adults can still purchase them from existing regulated operators.”
Huffman introduced the bill with state Sen. Shane Wilkin, R-Hillsboro. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has implored lawmakers to regulate or ban delta-8 THC products. 
The bill would also impose a 10% tax on intoxicating hemp products, ban sales to anyone under 21, and would only allow intoxicating hemp products to be sold at dispensaries if the products have been tested and comply with standards for packaging, labeling, and advertising. 
During discussion on the bill on Wednesday, senators talked primarily about how the bill would protect Ohio kids. 
“This bill regulates intoxicating hemp products and removes the untested, unsafe items that are marketed toward children from corner stores and vape shops and gas stations,” said state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus. “It includes requirements for product testing, safe packaging, age verification. These are all common sense measures.”
Wilkin spoke about how a health commissioner in his district came across an intoxicating hemp product that looked like Rice Krispies cereal box. 
“That is marketed to kids,” he said. “We don’t know what’s in them and unfortunately they are, without question, ending up in our kids’ hands and that’s not right.”
Children’s safety and standardization got the Senate Democrats on board with the bill as well, according to Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood. 
“The more we can narrow in the standardization and some oversight … and the safety of them, the better we are,” she said. “Is it perfect? No, but does it really get to some of the positive changes for safety’s sake? I think so.” 
CBD store owners previously testified against the bill, arguing this could potentially put them out of business. During testimony in March, Bellefontaine business owner Jaimee Courtney said the bill would eliminate 90% of the “non-intoxicating full-spectrum hemp products” her business offers, and that the bill would “drive consumers to unregulated online markets.”
“I don’t have a lot of sympathy for some of those businesses that are now being forced to not offer a product that was very clearly dangerous and targeted towards children,” said Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon. “I still think if (shops) were operating before (intoxicating hemp), they’re going to be able to operate after.” 
Members of the marijuana business, poison control workers, and religious organizations testified in support of the bill.  
The 2018 U.S. Farm Bill says hemp can be legally grown if it contains less than 0.3% THC. Ohio is one of about 20 states that does not have any regulations around intoxicating hemp products, according to an Ohio State University Drug Enforcement and Policy Center study from November 2024.

(Mark McCormick)When I learned that William “Buggs” Polite, one of my oldest friends and a person I deeply admired from my old neighborhood, had died following a stroke, my thoughts turned to Ta-Nehisi Coates’ 2015 masterpiece, “Between the World and Me.”
In one passage, Coates discussed losing his friend and classmate Prince Jones. Buggs wasn’t young, but to many of us, he was every bit the prince, and one who’d long been denied his crown. Buggs experienced the plunder of opportunities so common for Black professionals.
Still, he continually gave and continually served.
“I would smile whenever I saw him,” Coates wrote of his friend, “for I felt the warmth when I was around him and was slightly sad when the time came to trade dap and for one of us to go.”
That passage suits Buggs, the quintessential example of the good person you wanted good fortune to bless.
Buggs was a fixture of my childhood.
Playing 21 on a homemade goal behind Tony Hill’s house. Tackle the Man football along Don Eaton’s red duplex. Bumper pool and basketball pickup games at the MEFSEC (Moving Effectively for Social and Economic Change), now the Lynette Woodard Center.
Buggs stood out. He didn’t bully us. He seemed interested in what us little kids said. He encouraged us. I remember playing an entire summer of baseball and him smiling there in his bowlegged stance, at the last game of the season, after I swatted my one and only hit.
At North High, Buggs blazed trails.
One of our beloved counselors, Tommie Williams, bragged about how Buggs posted a near-perfect ACT score, and that Buggs had broken the classroom barrier of a teacher who’d said Black students couldn’t excel in his class.
He wrote an insightful editorial for the North Star newspaper, explaining how men wearing an earring could symbolize ties to African culture. He launched “B-BASE,” or Blacks for Better Academics and Social Equality.
Buggs then headed east to Atlanta’s historic Morehouse College, the school that accepted Martin Luther King Jr. when King was only 15. Buggs majored in math and eventually led charter schools. He once worked for one of basketball icon Magic Johnson’s foundations.
That meant little when he returned to Wichita and applied for a leadership position at a neighborhood youth center. We were shocked and angry when he wasn’t chosen. He was one of our brightest stars.
You might expect someone so accomplished to join in the orgy of self-promotion that seems so commonplace, but I don’t remember him ever bragging, even though he was one of the few who justifiably could. He wanted that job. I sensed his disappointment.
I’d once written an article about the city’s Black brain drain. Famed architect Charles McAfee inspired the article. He said our segregated community produced numerous Ph.D.s who were forced to leave Wichita to find opportunity.
That’s theft. That’s plunder. Too often, our hometown served as a killing field for Black professionals’ dreams. I felt that was a crown that had been denied him.
Undaunted, Buggs continued to give, and he eventually gained his crown as a stalwart in the public school system.
He tutored kids in math. He and Hercules Finley visited incarcerated youths and encouraged them. Buggs secured a building allowing him to expand his vision. He excitedly raised money and the hopes of community youths.
“The thing to understand about Prince Jones is that he exhibited the whole of his given name,” Coates wrote. “He was kind. Generosity radiated off him, and he seemed to have a facility with everyone and everything. This can never be true, but there are people who pull the illusion off without effort, and Prince was one of them.”
Buggs, too.
A lasting image of him came after my mother’s funeral. I had just slipped Pastor Lincoln Montgomery folded bills through a handshake as my family patriarch instructed, and there stood Buggs, his face registering the hurt and concern you’d expect from a friend.
“There are people,” Coates said, “whom we do not fully know, and yet they live in a warm place within us, and when” we lose them, “and the dark energy disperses, that place becomes a wound.”
This wound, for me and for that community, will take years to heal.

He is soliciting donations to pay for a poll to gauge his strength in a hypothetical general election against Harris, the lone Republican in the state’s congressional delegation.
Day has hired Adeo Advocacy, a powerhouse Baltimore-based fundraising firm that works for Moore and other leading Maryland Democrats, and is expected to engage a pollster soon, several Democrats said.
In a brief interview Wednesday evening, Day confirmed the exploratory effort but was otherwise circumspect.
“I’m flattered that people are interested in this,” he said. “I’ve heard a lot of messages of support over the past few weeks. I’m focused on my day job and time will tell on everything else.”
WBOC-TV in Salisbury first reported the existence of the exploratory effort three weeks ago, but the full extent of Day’s political activities ahead of a potential congressional bid have not previously been publicly known.
Early GOP candidate for governor taps former delegate as running mate

Maryland Democrats have long dreamed of knocking off Harris, the chair of the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill who is serving his eighth term. But under the gerrymandered congressional district lines fashioned by Democrats in the General Assembly, the 1st District, which includes the Eastern Shore, Harford County and a slice of Baltimore County, is overwhelmingly Republican. Even highly touted Democratic challengers like former state delegate and ex-gubernatorial candidate Heather Mizeur have fallen far short of defeating Harris over the years.
Harris won reelection last fall by 22 points over Democrat Blaine Miller III, at the same time President Trump was carrying the district by almost 17 points. Harris reported  having $884,283 in his campaign account as of March 31, according to his latest report with the FEC.
But hope springs eternal for the Democrats, who believe Trump’s current polling slump and Americans’ plunging confidence in the U.S. economy could provide rare opportunities for the party in the 2026 midterm elections. At a minimum, Day’s potential candidacy could bolster Moore’s reelection efforts next year — particularly if he faces a tough challenge from former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) — by engaging Democrats in a congressional district that the party does not often prioritize.
Day, a 42-year-old Army veteran, has long been considered a rising star in Maryland politics — and perhaps one of the few Democrats who could give Harris a tough race in the 1st District. He served on the Salisbury City Council from 2013 to 2015 and as mayor from 2015 to 2023. But it is often difficult for ambitious and accomplished Eastern Shore Democrats to progress far politically given the region’s conservative lean.
Adam Wood, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party — whose chair is Harris’ wife, Nicole Beus Harris — referred questions about the congressman’s reelection to the Harris campaign. The campaign did not immediately respond to an email Wednesday evening seeking comment.
Day endorsed Hogan for reelection, rather than the Democratic challenger, Ben Jealous, in 2018. At the time, he argued that Hogan would be a more effective partner for the city than Jealous, though there was undoubtedly a political element to the endorsement as well.
Municipal elections in Salisbury are nonpartisan affairs.
Day also endorsed then-Comptroller Peter Franchot over Moore in the 2022 Democratic gubernatorial primary, citing his longstanding ties to Franchot and his top advisers. But as telegenic, energetic military veterans, Day and Moore have quickly bonded, and Moore has made housing affordability and availability a top priority, elevating Day’s role in the administration.
Day has created a fundraising entity through the IRS. If he chooses to run for Congress, he’ll have to set up another campaign committee with the FEC, and any contributions for his exploratory effort will then be made public. Individual donations for the Democratic primary are capped at $3,500.
But if Day does not go ahead with a congressional bid, the donations to his exploratory committee will not be disclosed.

The CO2 gas fills pore spaces located within these formations. 
Recently, Ohio’s legislators introduced bills HB 170 and SB 136, which will give the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) primacy (primary control) over Ohio’s Class VI carbon dioxide injection wells. Currently, the U.S. EPA has control and issues the permits for Class VI wells. 
H.B. 170 and S.B. 136 will allow the ODNR chief to force non-consenting property owners to surrender use of the “pore space” under their private property. 
“A storage operator who has obtained the consent of owners of at least 70 percent of the pore space proposed to be used in a storage facility may submit a statutory consolidation application for the operation of the entire proposed storage facility to the chief of the division of oil and gas resources management,” H.B. 170 states.
Private landowners have no rights or the ability to stop this dangerous asphyxiant from being stored under their homes.
CCS does not remove any existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but rather captures carbon dioxide from industrial processes, including ethanol fermentation, methane reforming, Portland cement production, and emissions from fossil fuel power plants. The process is energy intensive and expensive. The CCS equipment can require up to 30% of the energy that a power plant produces.  
A recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change found “the levelized costs of electricity (LCOEs) for thermal power generation with CCS are at least 1.5 to 2 times above current alternatives, which include renewable energy plus storage.” 
In addition to increased electricity bills, taxpayers will be picking up the costs for the 45Q tax credits for carbon dioxide captured. The Inflation Reduction Act established rates per ton of CO2 sequestered at $85 per ton. Considering that a large coal power plant emits 15 million tons of CO2 per year; the subsidy would be $1.25 billion in taxpayer dollars per year for one power plant.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLEThere are many concerns about safety throughout the entire process, including the toxic chemicals needed to sequester the CO2 gas, the pipelines used to transport the gas, and issues with Class VI wells leaking CO2 gas. Some estimates say at least 900 miles of pipelines would be required to carry CO2 across the state from sources to injection wells in eastern Ohio. 
In 2020, the Mississippi town of Satartia experienced a pipeline rupture in a 24-inch pipe. The pipe spewed out CO2 at a pressure of 1300 psi for more than three hours. The accident resulted in 200 people being evacuated and 45 taken to the hospital, with many having resulting chronic illnesses.
Nearby cars shut off or failed to start because of lack of oxygen needed to operate internal combustion engines. Carbon dioxide gas is odorless, colorless, doesn’t burn, is heavier than air. It is also an asphyxiant and intoxicant, which makes releases from CO2 pipelines harder to observe and avoid especially when it spreads and migrates off the pipeline right-of-way.
In 2009, concerned citizens living in Darke County successfully mobilized over a 14-month period to stop a proposed carbon sequestration project. 
“The 35-member Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Project (MRCSP) cancelled the $92.8 million dollar proposal to inject one million tons of carbon dioxide captured over four years from an ethanol plant in Greenville, Ohio,” according to a report from Recharge News.
There is no guarantee that the CO2 will remain in the rock strata in perpetuity. Several factors could contribute to leaking of the super-critical CO2 gas from the underground storage locations. One of these is seismic activity. 
“The presence of seismic activity, both natural and induced, is of great importance when evaluating CO2 sequestration potential. Extensive fault zones may provide leakage pathways along which CO2 could migrate,” according to a study published in Environmental Geosciences. 
Additionally, the very act of injecting high-pressure CO2 into continental crusts could induce earthquakes and jeopardize carbon storage. 
“Deep borehole stress measurements at the Mountaineer coal-burning power plant on the Ohio River in West Virginia indicate a severe limitation on the rate at which CO2 could be injected without the resulting pressure build-up, initiating slip on preexisting faults,” according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.
The fact that Ohio has over 36,000 orphan oil wells also adds to the risks of injecting high pressure CO2 into Ohio’s Appalachian counties.
Finally, current CCS projects have shown that the process fails to capture the promised amounts of CO2 and many of the taxpayer subsidized projects have been terminated. 
According to the Geoengineering Monitor, after decades of research, “there is no evidence that CCS can address the causes of the climate crisis or significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
CCS is too risky and too expensive.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
 ‘It’s the system that needs fixing’

Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law Monday.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
The new law requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
 Opposition to ‘science of reading’

Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.













A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute





In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

The corporation refused to answer questions on how this could impact the state.
“The last 100 days have been very concerning for me,” said Mike Knisley, with the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council.
Thousands of union workers and billions of dollars — stalled.
“A lot of sweat equity into making sure that they were ready when Intel barked — we’re ready to move with this,” Knisley said. “That’s a little bit of a disappointment … I just don’t know in present time if that’s gonna be viable or not.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXWEWS/OCJ has been reporting for years on tech giant Intel’s massive semiconductor manufacturing facility — one that was supposed to be operational by now — and its financial hardships.
Knisely explained that workers are concerned now that the company has announced it will lay off a significant amount of its workforce, less than a year after cutting 15%. Bloomberg News reported 20%, but the company didn’t respond to comment on that number.





Intel’s stock has dropped by more than 50% in the last year, while the industry has grown by more than 120%. After spending 25 years on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Intel was replaced on the index by Nvidia, a leader in artificial intelligence, in late November. The company also had mass layoffs in October, cutting 15,000 jobs.
An Intel spokesperson declined to answer questions about how this could impact Ohio but pointed to Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s statement, which said, in part: “We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment … We are seen as too slow, too complex, and too set in our ways—and we need to change.”
Still, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine remains positive that the plant will be built by Intel’s updated date — in the 2030s.
“They put now close to $8 billion into the ground,” DeWine said. “There’s going to be chips that are going to be made there, I will guarantee you that.”
But he acknowledged the struggles the company is facing.
“What happens with Intel, what the future is with Intel — we certainly don’t know,” the governor said.
They are not the only major corporation cutting the work of thousands of Ohio workers. Microsoft recently stopped a $1 billion project to create multiple data centers in the state. The company did not respond to requests for comment.
“It would be a bad look for all of Ohio, including us with the trades, if everything went south and they just walked away,” Knisely said about Intel.
Still, the governor is telling Knisely not to worry.
“No company is going to invest as much money as they have already put into Ohio and walk away from it,” DeWine said.

Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s only filed candidate for governor has tapped a former state delegate as his running mate.
John Myrick, a Republican candidate for governor, tapped former Del. Brenda Thiam to round out his ticket as lieutenant governor.
Myrick, who ran a brief and unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate in the 2024 Maryland Republican primary, was the first — and so far, only — candidate to officially file for office in February. Following that, Myrick said he established a panel of advisers to seek a running mate.
“Quite frankly, one name was at the top of that list from the very beginning,” said Myrick, who announced Thiam had filed the required paperwork at the Maryland State Board of Elections just prior to their public announcement.
Myrick has spent the first part of the year speaking to Republican groups. It is not clear how much money he has raised. His first report will not be filed with the state until next year.
Democratic Gov. Wes Moore and Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller are expected to seek re-election in 2026 backed by a well-funded campaign machine.
Other Republicans, including Gov. Larry Hogan, have been mentioned as potential contenders in the Republican primary. Hogan, the first two-term Republican governor in Maryland since Theodore McKeldin, is a seasoned campaigner and adept fundraiser. His entry into the race could present challenges for other Republican primary candidates.

Myrick, a Prince George’s County resident, is a staunch critic of Moore especially on budget, tax and economic policies.
“Every Marylander wants lower taxes. Every Marylander wants safer streets,” Myrick told a crowd of about a dozen supporters gathered Wednesday on the grounds below the south side of the Maryland State House. “And we’re going to give that to them. In order to do that, it takes a bit of common sense, and more importantly, integrity and accountability.”
Myrick, in an interview after the announcement, said the cuts to federal jobs in Maryland and other adverse decisions by President Donald Trump are a direct reflection of Moore’s refusal to “work with” Trump.
“Pennsylvania hasn’t suffered like this. They have a Democrat governor,” Myrick said. “You know why they haven’t suffered on this? Because Gov. [Josh] Shapiro up there will work with this administration. He will maintain a cordial relationship with this administration, and he has.
“Our governor has publicly said he can’t. So what incentive does the federal government have to not savage Maryland? You know, I use that because I honestly feel that way,” Myrick said. “They’ve savaged Maryland over our top political personalities who refuse to work with them.”
It’s a punishment on Maryland he said would have also happened had Moore’s predecessor, Larry Hogan, been in office.
“I say that because of Larry Hogan’s animosity with Donald Trump, the animosity that they have between each other,” Myrick said.
Myrick, who will be 61 later this year, lives in Lanham with his wife Nancy Nevarez-Myrick. He is a federal consultant who previously served as a Harford County deputy sheriff and is a 23-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force Reserve, as well as a civilian intelligence officer, according to his campaign biography.

Myrick, in promoting his lieutenant governor, offered his stark contrasting comparison to Miller.
“I cannot govern the state by myself,” he said. “Unlike the current governor, I knew we needed a lieutenant governor who was the most qualified, best person for the job — not just somebody who can stand there and look cute. That’s what he’s got. That’s unacceptable.”
Miller, 60, served two terms in the House of Delegates representing Montgomery County. She holds a bachelors degree in civil engineering and has experience as an engineer, planner and transportation official in Montgomery County and Los Angeles County, California.
While in the House, Miller served four years on the Ways and Means Committee and four years on the Appropriations Committee. She worked on  paid family leave, transportation, domestic violence and STEM education, among other issues.
A Maryland Democratic Party spokesperson blasted the “blatant sexism” of Myrick’s remarks about Miller.
“It’s why John Myrick is a failed Republican politician that finished fifth in the Senate primary last year,” the spokesperson said. “Lt. Gov. Miller is a transportation engineer, former legislator, and proven statewide leader with years of service to the people of Maryland and continues to fight for us as the state’s lieutenant governor.  The remarks today show he doesn’t understand what governing actually means, or what kind of leadership Marylanders look for.”
Speaking to the gathered supporters Wednesday, Thiam (pronounced “cham”) said she planned to help “right this ship, to champion the values that are important to all of us.” Included in those, she said, were reducing taxes and “burdensome regulations” and a focus on the creation of  nongovernment  jobs.

“We’re going to make Maryland great again,” Thiam said. “I can guarantee you that.”
Thiam, a Washington County Republican, was the first Black woman Republican to serve in the House when she was appointed in October 2021 to fill Paul Corderman’s seat, when he was appointed to replace retiring Sen. Andrew Serafini. She lost her bid for election to the seat in 2022.
Thiam holds a master’s degree in education, focusing on special education, from the University of Maryland, College Park, a doctoral degree in special education leadership from Capella University and a post-graduate certificate in applied behavior analysis from Penn State University.
She has worked in special education for more than 20 years in both public and private Maryland schools as a teacher and, later, as an administrator managing teaching staff and budgets, as well as students with special needs.
“My favorite thing is fixing education and returning it to teaching the students, giving them the tools they need to be successful in their life and forgoing all the indoctrination that our current administration seems to think is important to us,” Thiam said. “All those strains of ideologies that we will not tolerate for our children.”
In an interview after the announcement, Thiam was asked to elaborate on the “strains of ideologies” that concern her in public education.
“Well, when you think about the conversations that are occurring, particularly in Frederick County, with what they’re going through, and having bathrooms for young people who may consider themselves of a different identity, but they can use the (different) bathroom,” Thiam said.
When asked if she was referring to students who identify as transgendered, she said “absolutely.”
Thiam also expressed concerns about “books that are questionable on our bookshelves for students to check out and read.” She said she did not believe those books were in libraries in Washington County “but in Frederick County, that does exist.”
In addition to her time in Annapolis, Thiam also ran an unsuccessful campaign last year for the 6th Congressional District seat.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Thiam stumbled out of the gate at Wednesday’s announcement, saying the “lieutenant governor is the president of the Senate. So, the fact that I have served in the House of Delegates, I’ve served in this fine institution. I know that I am prepared to get the work done.”
In Maryland, the lieutenant governor does not serve as Senate president, who is elected by senators from their own ranks. Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) has held the position for the last six years, and before him the position was held for more than three decades by Sen. Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr.
The Maryland Constitution defines the role of lieutenant governor, who is  the second-highest officer in state government, but whose duties are limited. Primarily, the lieutenant governor succeeds the governor in the event of a vacancy or fills in as acting governor if the governor is temporarily unable to fulfill the duties of the office. Other than that, the role is limited to duties delegated by the governor.
The lieutenant governor also chairs a half-dozen state panels, including the State House Trust, and serves as a member on four other panels.
Thiam later acknowledged the error when asked by a reporter, saying it was the result of late night research and a historical reference to the duties of the position.
Christopher Christian Cox was the only lieutenant governor to serve as Senate president. He was elected in 1864, at a time when governor and lieutenant governor were elected independently, and served one term before the position was abolished under the 1867 version of the Maryland Constitution, according to the Maryland State Archives.
The position was reestablished by voters in a 1970 constitutional amendment. The recreation of the office fulfilled a promise by Gov.

(Photo by Joe Zimmermann/ Maryland Department of Natural Resources)The Trump administration’s dismantling of the federal AmeriCorps program will be felt in Maryland state parks, classrooms, nonprofits and food pantries, state officials said during a Wednesday news conference.
About 250 Maryland AmeriCorps workers were dismissed over the weekend, said Paul Monteiro, Maryland Secretary of Service and Civic Innovation.
“We had to start making calls Friday evening into Saturday morning to inform them of the immediate termination of their grants,” Monteiro said. “Many of our members will likely face subsistence-level challenges, given that they’re ineligible for unemployment insurance and were already living on very modest stipends.”
The list includes 41 members of the Maryland Conservation Corps, who were expecting to continue working through the popular summer season at state parks, maintaining hiking trails, clearing invasive species and educating visitors, said Rachel Temby, deputy director of the Maryland Park Service.
“The impacts of this hasty decision have been felt from the mountains of Western Maryland to the shores of the Atlantic,” Temby said.
After a stop-work order was issued Saturday, state officials rushed to call all of the workers, some of whom were helping with weekend events such as the Pollinator Festival at Assateague State Park and the Market Fair at Fort Frederick, Temby said.
“They were pulled from service, and then many of them made the independent — and very considerate — decision to return as park volunteers to those activities that weekend, wishing to continue with their commitment to serve in any capacity they could,” Temby said.

A primary concern is that the AmeriCorps members will suddenly lose their “very modest” cost-of-living stipends, Monteiro said, forcing them to reconsider things like housing and health insurance.
“Our department is doing our level best to support demobilized members,” Monteiro said. “The first of the month is here in short order, and [members will be] accessing housing, accessing food, on top of being separated from organizations and networks they’ve been invested in over the course of the year.”
The members, between 17 and 25 years old, also expected to receive an educational stipend of about $7,000 at the end of their service terms, which they could use to pay student loans, Now, they are likely to receive a pro-rated portion of the stipend — not the whole thing.
A Moore administration official said Wednesday that the “bare bones” administrative staff at AmeriCorps, “gives me a lot of heartburn” about workers’ benefits.
Maryland is one of 24 states and the District of Columbia that are suing the Trump administration over its steep and sudden cuts to AmeriCorps. The lawsuit says that on April 15 AmeriCorps officials, at the behest of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), put all members of the National Civilian Community Corps on leave, and told them their service would be terminated on April 30. A day later, the suit says, AmeriCorps put about 85% of its paid staff of about 700 workers on administrative leave.
Last week, AmeriCorps began sending reduction-in-force notices to the paid staff and on Friday, after regular business hours, it began notifying states that about $400 million of AmeriCorps programs were immediately terminated.
The lawsuit argues that only Congress, not the administration, has the power to slash the agency.
“The Administration’s abrupt decision to dismantle AmeriCorps flouts Congress’s creation of AmeriCorps and assignment of agency duties; usurps Congress’s power of the purse and thereby violates the Constitution’s separation of powers,” the suit says.
Maryland Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz said Wednesday that the Conservation Corps program, which began in 1984, has had an immense impact on state parks.
“If you’ve hiked on a trail, if you’ve gone to a bathroom in a state park, you most likely are touching a project that the Maryland Conservation Corps has done over the years,” Kurtz said.
Maryland leads 25 states in suit to block Trump administration efforts ‘gutting’ AmeriCorps

DNR was projected to contribute about $1.6 million to the Conservation Corps program this year, the agency said, with AmeriCorps contributing about $922,000.
According to a DNR news release from last August, that year’s graduating class improved more than 2,400 acres of parks and public lands; planted more than 9,963 native trees, bay grasses and plants; treated more than 7,902 trees against harmful insects and diseases; and taught environmental education programs to more than 23,750 visitors.
Conservation Corps members have been instrumental in protecting one of the state’s older forest ecosystems, located in Swallow Falls State Park, said DNR spokesman AJ Metcalf. The area includes thousands of eastern hemlock trees, which have been victimized by invasive hemlock wooly adelgids.
In 2024, Conservation Corps members treated more than 7,000 of the trees, saving them from early deaths. The pesticide application took six days, but will last seven years, Metcalf said.
“Hemlock treatment is a simple process but requires significant human energy,” Metcalf wrote. “Many MCC members report that hemlock restoration work was one of the most rewarding projects of their term.”
For the individuals who spend a year in the corps, the program is a “career ladder,” Kurtz said, allowing them to gain skills that fuel careers in conservation fields. More than 50 current staff members at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources are Conservation Corps alumni, Temby said.
Temby said she supervised teams of Conservation Corps members for about six years, in her role as a Maryland Park Service ranger, and watched the program evolve, propelled by energetic workers.
“The sudden decision to terminate AmeriCorps funding for this program has dire impacts on the hopes and dreams of our corps members, but also the operations of the Maryland Park Service,” Temby said.

,California,2025-05-01 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Lawmakers might undermine California’s landmark public pension reform,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/public-pension-reform-california/,A bill that would usher in a major change in pension law could cost local governments billions. Yet it is sailing through the Legislature without any opposition.,"Thirteen years ago, a minor political miracle occurred in California’s Capitol.
A Democrat-dominated Legislature passed and a Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, signed a significant overhaul of state and local public employee pension systems.
It was a miracle because the reform was universally opposed by public employee unions, which were and still are the Capitol’s most potent political interests with long-standing ties to Democrats.
The overhaul, championed by Brown, made it into law because the state was then recovering from a very severe recession that had devastated government finances, and pension obligations — which had expanded sharply during the prior Gray Davis governorship — had become unsustainable burdens.
Mandatory pension payments into the California Public Employee Retirement System had been factors in the bankruptcies of two cities, and unfunded obligations for future benefits totaled many tens of billions of dollars.
The legislation capped benefits, increased retirement ages, blocked maneuvers that artificially increased some pensions, created a two-tier system that maintained benefits for current workers but limited them for future hires, and required workers to pay for at least half of pension costs.
“This is the biggest rollback to public pension benefits in the history of California pensions,” Brown said as he signed the bill. “We’re lowering benefits to what they were before I was governor the first time and reducing costs by up to $55 billion in PERS and billions more in other local pension systems. Under the new rules, employers and employees alike are going to contribute their fair share of the costs, resulting in a more sustainable system.”
Not surprisingly, some unions challenged aspects of the reform, particularly those outlawing pension-spiking maneuvers, but Brown fought back and won in the state Supreme Court. However the court refused to take a further step Brown sought, eliminating the “California rule” that prohibits reducing benefits for workers once they are enrolled in the system.
This bit of political history forms the background of new legislation that would, if passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, begin to undo what the 2012 reform wrought.
Assemblymember Catherine Stefani, a San Francisco Democrat, is carrying the legislation, Assembly Bill 569, which would repeal one of the major provisions of the reform banning local governments from enacting “supplemental retirement benefits” for their workers.
Stefani and the Teamsters Union, the measure’s sponsor, contend that Brown’s reform leaves workers without sufficient pension benefits to offset California’s notoriously high costs of living and makes it difficult for local governments to fill vacancies.

California’s immense pension dilemma 

by Dan Walters 
August 10, 2020August 6, 2020 




“It simply gives local governments and their employees another option at the bargaining table, one that might make the difference between losing or keeping a talented worker,” Stefani told the Assembly Public Employment and Retirement Committee last week.
The bill whipped through the committee on a 7-0 vote, including the committee’s two Republicans, Tom Lackey and Juan Alanis, both of whom are former police officers.
While the bill’s advocates say that it would merely be permissive, giving local governments the option to increase benefits, its practical effect would be to gut one of the reform’s most important safeguards. It would restore the ability of local government unions to put political pressure on city councils, county boards of supervisors and other local officials to expand benefits for the workers who have been hired since the reform was enacted, long a sore point for unions.
It’s amazing that such a major change in pension law would begin moving through the process without, so far, any opposition or even comment from the local governments that it would affect.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/05/01/judge-says-lawsuit-against-health-department-can-proceed-over-missed-nursing-home-inspections/,"A group of nursing home residents can press their lawsuit against the Maryland Health Department over lapsed nursing home inspections, and the case can proceed as a class-action suit, a federal judge has ruled.","The U.S. District Court in Baltimore. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)A group of nursing home residents can press their lawsuit against the Maryland Health Department over lapsed nursing home inspections, and the case can proceed as a class-action suit, a federal judge has ruled.
Those findings came after U.S. District Judge Matthew J. Maddox denied the department’s request to dismiss the case.
In that April 22 ruling, Maddox approved “class certification” for nursing home residents “who have disabilities and mobility impairment, and who live in nursing facilities” overseen by the Department of Health. Some 9,000 Marylanders fit that description and will be represented as the case continues, according to Justice in Aging, one of the advocacy groups leading the lawsuit.
“At this early stage of the litigation, the Court finds the facts alleged in the Complaint sufficient to draw a chain of causation between MDH’s oversight and enforcement failures and Plaintiffs’ particularized and unique injuries and risks as mobility-impaired residents of nursing facilities,” according to Maddox’s opinion. “Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Complaint … shall be denied.”
Attorneys representing five nursing home residents filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court for Maryland last May against the Health Department and its then-secretary, Laura Herrera Scott. The lawsuit alleges that the state’s failure to conduct annual nursing home inspections, as required, has led to substandard care for residents of those facilities.
“It’s a very positive step that we survived the motion to dismiss and provided sufficient evidence to the court for class certification,” said Liam McGivern, an attorney at Justice in Aging, while noting that there is still a long court process ahead.
Health officials cut inspection backlog of nursing homes, advocates demand more

The complaint asks the court to force the department to conduct nursing home surveys on the federally required 12-month schedule and ensure that complaints issued against nursing homes are answered in a reasonable time frame. It also asks for attorney’s fees and any other relief deemed appropriate by the court.
With its motion to dismiss rejected, the department has until May 20 to respond to the complaint. A department spokeperson did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Maddox’s ruling comes at a time when the health department is actively working through a years-old backlog of nursing home inspections. The department said it is making progress, with more than half of the state’s 220 nursing homes receiving an annual inspection within the last 16 months.
But with some facilities being more than four years overdue for an inspection, advocates fear that some Maryland seniors may be languishing in unsafe living conditions while the state plays catch-up.
“They’re still woefully behind,” McGivern said. “When complaints are not timely investigated, it often means that they’ll never be meaningfully investigated … The backlog is so bad when the state finally gets around to investigating a complaint months or years later, they’re not really able to adequately conduct that investigation — records are lost, residents have moved on, staff have moved on, the facility has changed ownership”
The initial court complaint outlines some nursing home residents’ troubling experiences in their facilities, some of which had not been inspected by the health department for four years. The plaintiffs have mobility-related disabilities and rely on nursing staff for moving around the facility, eating and personal hygiene. The lawsuit alleges that residents were often left unattended for extended periods, leaving them isolated from community events or sometimes left in soiled clothing for hours, among other concerns outlined in the lawsuit.
“When the state does not go in to survey and make sure that nursing facilities are doing what they’re supposed to be doing, that falls most harshly on people with mobility impairment – and so, discriminates against them within the meaning of the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act],” McGivern said. “They have no way to remedy, for example, their call not being answered or the facility not helping them leave their beds, leaving them confined and isolated in their room.”
In the time that has passed since the initial court filing, one plaintiff has died, a 75-year-old identified by the pseudonym “Herman Dressel.” The complaint said Dressel had mobility limitations that required staff assistance bathing, dressing and getting in and out of bed. But as with other plaintiffs in the case, he did not receive the daily support to help him move about the day and receive the incontinence care that was expected for his services.
McGivern noted they are not claiming that his March 30 death “is the result of any lack of oversight,” but should be a reminder of the vulnerable people who are at the center of the lawsuit.
“Often times, it seems that the issues that arise in a nursing facility are in the shadows,” he said. “There’s not any light shown on them and a lot of that has to do with the fragility of some people in nursing facilities who aren’t able to raise these issues for themselves and who unfortunately often times die while waiting on the state to investigate their claims, or that complaint. That is quite common, I’m afraid.”

Marjorie Taylor Georgia U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is making noises like she might make a run for U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff's seat in 2026. Al Drago/Getty ImagesBrian Kemp is not a large man, but he is the Big Dawg. The scramble doesn’t start until the two-term governor says it starts.
But once Kemp makes up his mind whether to run for the U.S. Senate next year, he will set off a mad dash by politicians of both parties hoping to move up a notch or two in Georgia’s political hierarchy. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is making noises like she might be one of them.
I don’t mean to scare you. Greene is one of those politicians who can’t be beaten within her district, but who can’t win outside that district. She can’t win a statewide general election in Georgia. She probably can’t win a statewide primary either. 
Look at the numbers: In the 2024 election cycle, Donald Trump carried Greene’s north Georgia district by 37 percentage points, while Greene won it by 29 points. If you underperform Trump by 8 points in your own district, if a good number of your own voters are willing to embrace Trump but find you too bizarre, then trying to win statewide is a fool’s mission.
Which by definition means she might try anyway. 
On Saturday, standing before a banner reading “Save America. Stop Communism,” Greene told an annual convention of her home-district Republicans that “the Democrat Party is overcome with evil,” and she urged them to help the GOP take back the U.S. Senate seat won five years ago by Jon Ossoff.
“It was never theirs to begin with,” Greene said to cheers and applause. “That was stolen, that Senate seat was stolen, and so was Warnock’s Senate seat stolen, just like Donald Trump’s election was stolen in 2020.”
It’s always tempting, and often unfair, to use a party’s more extreme personalities to characterize the party as a whole. Republicans do it, and so do Democrats. But in listening to Greene’s comments, I was struck by the fact that in the second Trump administration, Greene is closer in tone and content to the Republican mainstream than she was in his first term. She has gone from outlier to MAGA mainstream, and it isn’t Greene that has moderated her attitude. The second Trump regime has moved much closer to Greene.’s view of the world
Consider the role of free trade. In her remarks, Greene offered a pretty accurate description of Georgia and its current importance in the global economy.
“Georgia is the economic hub of the Southeast,” she noted. “Georgia has the third largest port in America. That is incredible control of shipping and trade. Georgia has the busiest airport in the world, in the city of Atlanta. Georgia has two corridors, I-75 and I-85, that run through our state, branching out into our neighboring states. That’s more trade, that’s interstate, that’s commerce. Georgia is the economic hub of the Southeast, and the Democrats want to take control of it just like they took control of California years ago and just like they control New York.”
The economy that she describes is the investment of generations, investment that has made Georgia more productive and prosperous than most of its Southern neighbors. Everything she cites – our ports, our highways, Hartsfield-Jackson airport – are publicly funded infrastructure. 
But as we’re about to be reminded in the next few months, a Georgia economy built on logistics and global commerce is also much more vulnerable to the disruptive, chaotic and undisciplined trade policies of the Trump regime. In fact, it’s probably not accurate to describe them as policies at all. They seem to be more the product of urges and resentments than of rational planning.
That’s certainly how Greene’s economic “theory” comes across.
“I’m tired of our state leaders importing foreign countries’ companies to our state, claiming job creation,” she told the crowd. “You want to know the reality? That big old battery plant in Cartersville….? Here’s the reality: They’re bringing in something like 200 to 300 families from Korea to work in that battery plant.
“They didn’t create jobs in Georgia by doing this, they are importing jobs into Georgia.”
That “big old battery plant” is a joint venture between two Korean firms, expected to employ thousands to build enough electric batteries to power 300,000 electric vehicles a year. At the Indeed job-search site, the plant is advertising engineering jobs paying up to $120,000 a year, shift supervisors making $34 an hour, jobs that provide 401ks and health insurance, with production slated to begin later this year.
But according to Greene, “that’s not what Georgia needs to be doing … they’re not helping Georgia be Georgia. It’s changing Georgia, and we’ve all witnessed this for years now, starting with the Hollywood tax credits.
“I do not want to associate with those (Hollywood) people. I don’t like their values, I don’t like their award ceremonies, I don’t want them living in our state and taking advantage of our tax dollars … We need to be supporting Georgia-born and -bred companies in our state.
“Georgia has been invaded,” she asserted. “Georgia has been watered down.  Georgia is on the verge of being lost.”
As Greene noted, that’s the Georgia First version of the America First approach taken by Trump, and both versions are economically illiterate and irrational. The damage that they could potentially do – the damage that has already been done – will undo the work of generations and require generations to repair.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)President Donald Trump (R) reached his first 100 days in office this week, a milestone that appeared to spark 10o opinions from Maryland lawmakers on his performance so far during his second term.
But like most things Trump-related, those opinions largely fell into just two camps — love him or loathe him.
The seven-member Freedom Caucus was clearly in the first camp. The MAGA-aligned Republicans in the Maryland House of Delegates applauded Trump for his “decisive actions during the first 100 days of his second term,” according to a statement from the group Wednesday.
“His leadership has focused on prioritizing American interests, ensuring long-term economic stability, and safeguarding individual freedoms,” their statement said, adding that Trump’s various executive orders increasing immigration enforcement that highlight his “strong commitment to securing the nation’s borders and keeping communities safe.”
Trump, himself, celebrated his 100 days at a rally in Michigan where banners proclaimed a new “golden age” for America.
Not surprisingly, Maryland Democrats were seeing red, not gold.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), in a 42-minute speech on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon, said Trump’s first 100 days had brought “chaos and destruction.” He said Americans are giving Trump “a big fat ‘F’ for the first 100 days. Total, miserable, failure.”
“This is all a Trump-afflicted wound on America and American families,” Van Hollen said. “Donald Trump has embarked on a law-breaking spree that has torn up our Construction, torn up apart our government and torn down our economy.”
Van Hollen joined other Maryland lawmakers who blamed Trump and billionaire and DOGE director Elon Musk for creating job losses and negatively affecting programs like SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

“Trump has pushed for devastating cuts to federal workers’ benefits, Medicaid, Head Start and SNAP, all so his billionaire buddies get one more giant tax cut,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in a statement Wednesday. “Across the country, the people are rising up and sending a clear message to Donald Trump: we need an economy that works for working families, not for autocrats and oligarchs.”
Sens. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released a report claiming to show how the Trump administration has hurt senior citizens and people with disabilities. The report said a Trump administration plan to slash Medicaid funding would result in higher prescription drug costs.
“It is clear that those who have been leading our country these last 100 days and making decisions about our health care are not only wildly unqualified, they are dangerous. Our families deserve better, [and] we are sick of it,” said Alsobrooks, who took office in January.
Another Maryland freshman, Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), said the administration’s mass firings of federal workers harmed Maryland institutions such as the Social Security Administration, National Security Agency and National Institutes of Health.
“I firmly believe that Congress should be a responsible check on every President’s power and must reassert itself as a co-equal branch of government, which is why I will continue to speak out against the President’s most harmful policies and use every tool at my disposal to protect our communities,” she said in a statement.
Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd), a one-time high school government teacher, stuck with the report card them others used for Trump’s first 100 days. On social media, Olszewski wrote and circled an “F” next to civics, economics, world history and health.
“As you can tell, not a great start. So President Trump, you might want to come see me after class,” he said, while holding a red marker.
Mfume pulls name from impeachment resolution
Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) was signed on as a co-sponsor Monday of a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump (R), but by Tuesday he had asked to have his name removed from the proposal.
Awkward? Not so, said an Mfume spokesperson.

“Congressman Mfume removed himself as a cosponsor from H. Res. 353 because he was made aware it was not cleared by Democratic leadership and not fully vetted legally — and he preferred to err on the side of caution,” according to a written statement from Mfume’s communication office Wednesday.ol
Mfume was one of three Democrats who pulled their names off the measure, along with Reps. Jerry Nadler of New York and Robin Kelly of Illinois. That left just the original sponsor, Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.), and co-sponsor Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) on the resolution.
The resolution cites seven articles of impeachment against Trump, who was twice impeached by the House in his first time in office, but never convicted by the Senate, allowing him to stay in office. Included in this latest impeachment effort is a charge of “obstruction of Justice, violation of due process, and a breach of the duty to faithfully execute laws,” citing the recent erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, among other issues.
“He has … acted in contempt of court for violating a court-sanctioned settlement agreement,” and “conducted enforced disappearances of persons without due process and without disclosing their fate and location to their families and legal counsel, in violation of the Constitution adfrt5nd the rulings of the Supreme Court, as well as the foundational principles of due process and the rule of law,” the resolution says.
The other articles of impeachment in Thanedar’s resolution include: Usurpation of the appropriations power, abuse of trade powers and international aggression, violation of First Amendment rights, creation of unlawful office, bribery and corruption, and tyranny.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2208184612-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 01:01:45.744204

It won’t be its mid-20th century norm of Whirlaway and Citation, British royals and Hollywood stars, movie newsreels and Time magazine covers, of course, or the half-life reburst of that era epitomized by Secretariat. Or the subsequent coasting on old glories and nostalgic Americana. 
Those times were based largely around a curated commonality — the sport of horse racing, real and imagined — and are ancient history. The current norm is a lot more corporate and complicated and revolves around an unsought intersectionality of the business and politics of horse racing, broadly defined. 
Start with Churchill Downs Inc., the track’s corporate parent. Formed in 1950, CDI was low-profile for decades but has morphed into a publicly-traded, nationally leading racing, online wagering and gaming company, with some 29 casinos and racing properties across 14 states.  It had record net revenue of $2.7 billion last year, up 11% from 2023. 
Numbers for the Derby last year showed a record $320.5 million wagered from all sources on Derby day and on the Derby race alone a record $210.7 million. Attendance of 156,710 was the highest since 2018 (the record of 170,513 was set in 2015). And the race attracted an average 16.7 million viewers on NBC and Peacock, the most since 1989. 
Over the past two-plus decades, CDI has spent more than $500 million on capital projects at Churchill, capped by a $200 million paddock redesign completed last year that CEO Bill Carstanjen said “drove the Derby experience and our financial results to a level we could not have imagined just a few years ago.”
In February, CDI announced plans for  $920 million in projects to expand and renovate its infield and grandstand and improve its infrastructure. The projects, slated to begin this year and be completed in 2028, were paused last week, CDI said, due to increasing uncertainty surrounding construction costs related to tariffs, trade disputes and current economic conditions. 
Its completed projects have turned Churchill, a National Historic Landmark site, into a modernized physical plant that dominates what remains of the working-class South Louisville neighborhood around it. (Over recent decades, CDI has acquired numerous properties in the neighborhood to construct  grand entrances and add landscaped and parking areas.) 
Inside its gates, there are a plethora of new and renovated hospitality spaces, suites and rooms at almost every turn, shaping an overall milieu Churchill terms an “experience.” The track has become an entertainment facility, with racing, including to an increasing extent the Derby, more plotline than raison d’etre. 
Except for the iconic 1895 twin spires, vestiges of its pre-renovation past — sprawling betting and concession spaces packed with motley crowds, hidden corridors, brick walkways, a crowded paddock, a wide-open and raucous infield, trough urinals in men’s rooms, beer on tap — disappear year by year and the environment becomes less soulful and more gentrified and risk-averse.   
For the Derby, the certainty of Churchill’s corporate march is being intersected more and more by the uncertain state of American racing. For decades, the sport has faced predictions of demise, given its aging fan base, marginal TV coverage and competition from lotteries, casinos and online sports betting. Its current troubles include shrinking field sizes, reduced purses and the closing of major tracks, including Hollywood Park in greater Los Angeles (where the first Breeders Cup was held and now the site of SoFi Stadium) and Arlington Park near Chicago.
The Derby’s attendance, financial and television numbers, which seem to break records each year, belie the demise. But then there are the numerous racing-related drug scandals and on-track horse deaths that have become recurring national news in the past decade. The drug scandals have involved prominent trainers and led to suspensions and federal indictments and convictions. The deaths have forced major tracks to close for investigations of surfaces and training practices. (Nationally, racehorse fatalities have been decreasing, with the rate last year falling to its lowest level in 16 years.)
Both drugs and deaths have directly impacted Churchill. In 2021, Medina Spirit, who finished first in the Derby, was disqualified for failing a post-race drug test. That led to a  protracted and very public legal battle involving the horse’s high-profile trainer, Bob Baffert, owner Amr Zedan and Churchill. The track prevailed and Baffert, whose horses have won a record-tying six Kentucky Derbies, was banned from Churchill for three years. He returns this year and has two horses running in the Derby. 
Churchill also became a focus of media and public attention when 12 horses died at the track during its 2023 spring meet. Two of the deaths occurred on Derby day. The track suspended racing to investigate the situation and moved the remainder of its meet to Ellis Park (also owned by CDI) in Western Kentucky. Last year, 13 horses died racing or training at Churchill. And just last week, a three-year-old horse was euthanized on the track after fracturing his front legs during a morning workout.

The politics of racing have catalyzed around drug and death issues and gained widespread traction. In 2020, after years of lobbying by groups from The Jockey Club to PETA, Congress authorized the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority (HISA) to develop and implement a national, uniform set of safety and anti-doping and medication rules. It’s now in effect at 47 tracks in 19 states. (PETA continues to push for stricter horse safety standards and investigate and highlight racing’s underside.) 
Racing’s most recent political issue is decoupling, which surfaced in Florida early this year when the owners of Gulfstream Park, a leading national track, proposed separating the facility’s racetrack from its casino, ending casino revenues supporting  racing and closing the track in a few years. Though strongly opposed by Florida horsemen, legislation allowing the decoupling passed the state House and a Senate committee. Gov. Ron DeSantis has indicated his opposition and its outcome is unclear.
Many in the industry believe that, if approved in Florida, decoupling would set a precedent and jeopardize racing across the country. Churchill wouldn’t be affected by such a scenario since casinos aren’t legal in Kentucky. But the track is closely coupled to historical horse racing (HHR), an electronic gambling product where players bet on replays of races on slot machine-like terminals. HHR, along with live racing, accounted for $1.3 billion of CDI’s $2.7 billion net revenue last year and it provides significant support for Churchill’s racing purses, including the Derby’s $5 million one.
Despite its success in Kentucky, HHR hasn’t become a panacea for American racing. Its legality as pari-mutuel wagering (as opposed to slot machine gambling) has frequently been challenged, and it’s allowed in only a handful of states. In March, it was struck down by the Louisiana Supreme Court for operating in the state without voter approval. That decision led CDI to announce a 25% cut in purses at Fair Grounds, the New Orleans racetrack it owns.
For CDI and the Derby, HHR and ongoing record profits, popularity and expansion is the bull-market side of its current norm. What to make of the bear-market side — drugs, deaths, track closings and the like —  is the question. Is it all much ado about nothing or a portent of the Colosseum and Rome before the fall? So far, the main response seems to be deferral or, every now and then, a muted “But not yet. … Not yet.”

That is where a political leader with an autocratic craving uses the military to violently overthrow a population with brute force and subjugate them to the extreme views of the dictator. A soft coup is the preferred method of the leaders of Turkey, Hungary and others.
The method is well planned, detailed and strategic. Your main opponents are the legislature, judiciary and the press. If you’re a charismatic populist the legislature has already bowed to your will due to multiple fear factors – loss of job, personal safety and possible imprisonment.
We are in the first or second stage of a soft coup in the U.S. There is no need to wait and see if we’re in a constitutional crisis or if we’ve “crossed the Rubicon.” This happened the minute the election was over. This coup was in the planning stages for four years. They even published their battle plans.
The first step in fighting this is to acknowledge that we’re already in an existential crisis. You can’t adapt a strategy until you realize how desperate the situation already is. You also can’t just fight with anger, emotions and protest. You have to carefully analyze the situation, determine strengths and weaknesses, what boundaries contains the administration and how to maximize the defense of democracy and our constitution.
If you think capitulation to a despot is a workable response you could ask any of the oligarchs that have tried to appease Putin, if they weren’t dead or terrified. It is risky fighting at the current stage of a soft coup but nearly impossible once they consolidate power.
Donald Trump’s administration does have some weaknesses and constraints that will constrain their progress. There isn’t a uniformity of purpose, there are many conflicting goals in this gang. There is a time constraint bound by when the midterm congressional races start.
In his current self-destructive mode Trump is making most people very angry and all but his loyalist supporters are regretting their vote. Then there is his current mental state. He can be clinically described as a narcissist and is subject to the distortions that malady imposes.
He’s like that guy at a high school reunion who has waited half his life to get even with everyone who ever slighted him. He is wasting precious time doing just that rather than sticking to a carefully orchestrated plan. He is also not thinking rationally, nor does he have any meaningful plan for improving any aspect of governance in our country. He is just ranting about his pet grievances and seems to have a short memory and attention span.
Financially he has retreated when advised that he could start another great depression and he does pay attention to poll numbers. The military is hopefully the strongest bulwark against a hard coup. Although individuals must have individual ideologies and opinions, the discipline of the military is an individual sacrifice for the greater good. Service members risk their lives to defend our democracy at home or at foreign nations they might not have even have heard of. It’s hard to imagine the US military participating in a coup and using brutal force against its own citizens.
Unfortunately, there are many strong points to this ongoing soft coup. Foremost is Trump’s skill in the media. People seemed swayed simply by his swagger and style and tend to ignore what he’s actually saying. Another is an extremely conservative Supreme Court who seems confused about what branch of government they occupy. Re-writing the Constitution, voiding hard-fought laws such as the Civil rights Act and Voting Rights Act because they deemed them no longer necessary and expanding executive power to a dangerous degree is not a mandate intended for the highest court in the land.
Trump has managed to bully the entire Republican Party into submission. There didn’t seem to be a lot of bravery or forethought to overcome to start with. Congress is the one group that actually can command executive authority and stop the slaughter of our institutions and freedom. You would think that there would be four senators and four members of Congress that would be outraged enough on their own to sacrifice their careers for the good of their country and switch parties without additional encouragement.
But apparently, they need to be confronted with the reality if the direction of the country continues into chaos that they will be voted out of office anyway. So, my suggestion is that everyone makes that abundantly clear in every town hall, every protest and every confrontation possible. You won’t get another chance. Ask the Russians how the resistance is going.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-01 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Pope Francis: A legacy of love,Michelle Loris,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/01/pope-francis-church-as-field-hospital/,"we are taking time to reflect on Pope Francis’ legacy of love that is visionary, groundbreaking, and transformative for the Catholic Church.","Here at Sacred Heart University, we mourn the loss of our Pope and Pastor. 
From the beginning of his papacy, we have felt a special bond with him.  We are the first university to name a building after him —Bergoglio Hall, which was dedicated by the pope’s friend from childhood, Rabbi Abraham Skora; and we also offer the Bergoglio Lecture series that has featured several Francis-appointed cardinals. In addition, we are a Laudato Si’ campus that recently completed a week-long recognition of Earth Week.
Francis worked to extend the work of the Vatican II Council, and Sacred Heart University was founded by and is shaped by Vatican II thought. Now we are taking time to reflect on Pope Francis’ legacy of love that is visionary, groundbreaking, and transformative for the Catholic Church. 
He brought a Vatican II vision that read the signs of the times through the lens of gospel love and mercy. His first encyclical, Laudato Si’, a landmark work, called the world to hear the cry of the earth and the poor. He insisted that we pay attention to the degradation we reaped upon our common home and to recognize the social and economic injustice that this degradation has brought to the poor and marginalized.
In what is a fearless Apostolic Exhortation, Amoris Laetitia, he wanted to extend the conversation and deepen the reflection on the complexities and concerns of the diverse structures of contemporary families. Despite the dubia leveled against this document, the work underscores that God’s love and grace are the foundation, and yes, the maverick Francis wanted to move the church to take a pastoral approach toward respecting and accompanying all families on their journey to God with compassion, mercy and understanding.
Perhaps his most daring and transformative work extending the vision of Vatican II will be the Synod on synodality. Francis’ aim was to change our way of being Church. He brought together clergy and laity, men and women and those with opposite positions, listening to each other and in conversation about what for some were the difficult topics of lifting up the role of women in the church, the LGBTQ community, married priests, divorced and remarried couples. And despite the unfinished work of the Synod, Francis wanted to widen the church’s tent and show that all the People of God are included in God’s loving embrace.
Fiducia Supplicans is a Pastoral declaration on blessings for couples in what the church refers to as irregular situations including same sex relationships. This document received some extremely negative responses, but Francis defended it as being  a way to show God’s love and mercy to those in different relationships. This document does nothing to change Church doctrine about the sacrament of marriage, but it expresses a gesture of love and compassion that Francis wanted the Church to bring to the people on the margins.
I recall introducing this document to my students in our Human Journey: Catholic Intellectual Tradition seminar class. We had been reading an excerpt from Fr. James Martin’s book Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the LGBTQ Community Can Enter into a Relationship, Compassion, and Sensitivity and, while the students were pleased with the idea of Fr. Martin’s book, they still complained about the Church’s position on LGBTQ individuals and other forms of relationships. 
Every student in the class had a friend or family member who was LGBTQ, and a number of the students had parents who were divorced and remarried. Some of these students admitted being disaffiliated from the church because of its views on these forms of relationships. When I brought in Fiducia Supplicans and had the students read and discuss it, they responded positively to what they saw as the church being welcoming and inclusive. This response from my students was what Francis intended—a pastoral way for the church to express love and mercy as Jesus had done and to bring people closer to their faith.
Francis viewed the church as a ‘field hospital.’ He wanted the Church to go to the margins bringing love, mercy and care to the poor, the migrant, the dispossessed. He was the sole moral voice speaking about the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. He strongly criticized President Donald Trump’s policy on immigrants, and he urged Catholics to show compassion and care for the immigrant.  At Lampedusa he railed against our indifference to the suffering of others. His voice, filled with love and care, spoke loudly for those who had no voice.
His sacramental gestures symbolized the love and mercy he wanted the church to bring to the world. He was the first Pope to take the name of Francis, after Saint Francis of Assisi and, like his namesake, Francis chose simplicity and humility. When he was selected Pope and stepped onto the loggia, he asked the people to bless and pray for him. 
He chose to live in the Vatican’s guesthouse rather than its Apostolic Palace and, for his burial, he chose Santa Maria Maggiore rather than St. Peters with a simple stone reading Francis. He held, embraced and blessed the children wherever he travelled. When asked about a gay priests, his well-known response was “Who am I to judge?” He washed the feet of women and prisoners. He reached out and embraced a disfigured man in the crowds. 
While in the hospital with double pneumonia, he called the Parish in Gaza each night. Francis loved being with the people. Even though at Easter, he was not sure he should go into the crowds, he went anyway. How else to bring love into the world and “become the word in body as well as spirit.” And just before he died, he thanked his nurse for taking him to the people.
Dilexit Nos: On Human and Divine Love of the Heart of Jesus Christ was —very fittingly— was Francis’ last encyclical, and we at the university have been reflecting on this document to understand more deeply how our mission and culture are imbued with Francis’ vision and thought. In this last letter from Francis, we find a message for all of us. Francis wrote that the heart, rooted in the Sacred Heart of Jesus, is the core of our humanity and the source of our ability to love. 
As our Pope and Pastor, Francis lived, wrote about, modelled and exuded that love for us —for all of us. “Todos! Todos! Todos!”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-01 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Just Cause Eviction is an essential policy for the health and safety of CT residents,Patricia Lewis and Teresa Quintana,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/01/just-cause-eviction-is-an-essential-policy-for-the-health-and-safety-of-ct-residents/,"In Connecticut, the combination of high housing costs and low vacancy rates has created what some have deemed as the worst place in the country for renters.","Juana is a Hartford resident who immigrated to the United States over 10 years ago. In 2022, like many Connecticut renters, Juana faced a substantial and unaffordable rent increase. 
Terrified by the prospect of eviction, she sought help from Make the Road CT (MRCT) – a community-based organization focused on empowering immigrant and working-class communities. Neighbors from Juana’s building joined her at MRCT and they learned to collectively address the rent increase by organizing to demand better housing. 


Unfortunately, many residents received eviction notices soon thereafter and some of Juana’s neighbors fled in fear. This tragedy could have been prevented if Connecticut had a Just Cause eviction protection policy in place.
The experience of Juana and her neighbors is unfortunately not uncommon. Stable housing is not the reality for many renters in Connecticut where housing costs are unaffordable, and few policies exist to protect tenants from price hikes and retaliatory evictions. There is a long history in our country of treating renters as second-class citizens, and they currently face segregationist zoning policies, limited protections in economic crises, and exclusion from tax policies that benefit homeowners. In this restrictive environment, housing instability is commonplace, and many low-income renters shuffle from one bad apartment to another, often involuntarily.
For Juana, a single mother and survivor of domestic violence, fighting the unwarranted eviction was the only option to protect her family from homelessness. While all renters in Connecticut face highly inflated rent costs, many immigrants encounter additional challenges, such as language barriers and lack of credit history, which further complicate finding quality housing. Despite paying taxes, immigrants often lack access to subsidized housing due to not having a Social Security number. These factors place immigrant families like Juana’s at greater risk of experiencing housing cost burden and eviction.
In Connecticut, the combination of high housing costs and low vacancy rates has created what some have deemed as the worst place in the country for renters. High housing costs place renters at risk of eviction. In fact, Connecticut towns that have high rental costs compared to average incomes have greater eviction rates. Here, landlords are able to evict tenants in order to raise rent prices, even when tenants have been paying the rent on time. And this occurrence happens more often to Black and Latino/a renters, particularly female-headed households like Juana’s.
HB 6889, An Act Concerning Evictions for Cause could help address this injustice. This bill would build on protections already in place for elderly and disabled residents and expand protections to all renters in Connecticut. Specifically, HB 6889 would prohibit landlords from carrying out ‘no fault’ evictions of tenants occupying units in buildings with more than five units. This means that, if a tenant is paying their rent on time like Juana was, they cannot be unjustly evicted because the landlord wants to raise the rent.
Recent evidence indicates that, if passed, this policy would not stymie housing production, but it would serve to keep families like Juana’s stably housed. The prevention of eviction and homelessness can help build stronger and safer communities for renters and homeowners alike. This policy would put us in line with other progressive states like California, Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, and Washington, which already have just cause eviction laws.
Preventing no-fault evictions through the HB 6889 could  also have life-saving impacts. Research indicates that high rental burdens and subsequent evictions place renters at an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, including mental distress, reproductive health outcomes, and even premature death. Preventing no-fault evictions would also address retaliatory evictions that take place when tenants advocate for improved health and safety conditions in their unit. This would be especially important for families with children, who have a disproportionate risk for eviction and subsequent economic difficulties.
As the Trump administration moves to cut affordable housing and targets immigrant families for deportation, we need to take action in Connecticut to protect our neighbors. To our representatives in Hartford who are concerned about the health and stability of families and the rights of immigrant communities like Juana’s, we strongly encourage you to support Just Cause and vote in favor of HB 6889.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)For the third time in two years, the Alaska Legislature has approved a bill that seeks to increase long-term state funding for the state’s K-12 public schools.
On Wednesday, the state Senate voted 17-3 and the House voted 31-8 to approve House Bill 57, which would permanently increase the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-student funding formula, by $700 per student, or $183 million across the state per year.
The bill also makes some policy changes for charter schools, creates a grant program to encourage schools to improve students’ reading performance, and establishes an education task force to recommend further changes.
“I can’t express how much gratitude that I know all of Alaska is sending with the message that we’ve sent,” said Rep. Alyse Galvin, I-Anchorage, after the House passed the bill.
“Everybody wants something for children, and to see what we’ve seen, people working together … I think that was achieved and we found a little something for everyone.”
Wednesday’s votes send the bill to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who vetoed two previous bills that attempted to increase the BSA. 
The governor did not have an immediate comment on the Legislature’s action. Dunleavy, on a trip to Washington, D.C., was unavailable for questions by phone, a spokesperson said.
While the Legislature failed to override the governor’s two previous vetoes, the result of a third override could be different, legislators said.
“It’s one of the most sweeping sets of policy reforms for education, I think, in state history,” said Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage and the original author of HB 57. “And I think that’s why you see such unity between the chambers and from every caucus. And that kind of unity is unprecedented.”
Since the start of April, the governor has urged the Legislature to include policy changes for charter schools, an open enrollment policy between schools and districts, an extra funding boost for homeschooled students, and grants for school districts whose students meet reading standards. 
In talks over the weekend, the Republican minority caucuses in both House and Senate negotiated some of those provisions into HB 57. That was enough to sway some Republicans who voted against prior school funding measures, such as the recently vetoed House Bill 69.
“That’s the process; you do the best that you can, and this is a much better bill than HB 69,” said House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage. She voted against House Bill 69, but in favor of HB 57.
“Vetoing HB 69 set the stage for being listened to by the majority. When we stuck together on that veto, we were basically sending a message that there were other things that needed to happen,” Costello said.
“While nobody is perfectly fine with the outcome of this bill, it makes it a step in the right direction, and we couldn’t have gotten there if we hadn’t held firm on that.” 
In an unusual move, the governor’s education commissioner sent a letter to school district superintendents on Monday, asking them to lobby the Legislature in favor of the governor’s proposals. 
Within the letter, she said that if the Legislature failed to meet the governor’s demands, he could end up vetoing money used to pay for the updated formula. 
In the end, some of the governor’s requests were included, but others — including an extra funding boost for homeschooled students — were not. 
Last year, lawmakers approved $174 million in one-time bonus funding on top of the BSA, so the formula change would not significantly increase year-over-year funding. Instead, the change’s main advantage is that it allows school districts to plan ahead when budgeting, instead of waiting to see what the Legislature approves each year. 
“Having the stability of the funding in the formula is critically important,” Fields said. 
Without the change, school districts have to act as if there will be no funding bonus, a possibility until the state budget is finalized. That means warning teachers of possible layoffs, then rehiring them when money is approved.
“Having (the BSA increase) in policy avoids this destructive policy of pink slips and replacement,” Fields said.
At the start of the year, school districts said they needed a BSA increase of more than $1,800 to keep up with inflation since 2011. The final version of HB 57 is a little over a third of that figure, and some lawmakers called it a good first step.
“Fairbanks schools are suffering right now. Our schools have been starving for well over a decade. It’s absolutely critical that we invest right now. This funding is stabilizing our school district and districts across the state, and it was a no-brainer,” said Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks.
But not everyone was pleased with the final result — of the Legislature’s 60 members, 11 Republicans voted against the bill, and one, Rep. David Nelson, R-Anchorage, was excused absent.
Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, said she was unhappy with the final versions of policy proposals inserted into the bill. The reading grants won’t become effective unless a bill updating corporate taxes becomes law. Open-enrollment provisions, which would allow students to transfer between schools and districts, were referred to a task force and not included in the bill.
“I just felt like the policy positions that were taken in the bill were not strong policy positions,” she said.
Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, also voted against the bill.
“I don’t think it’s enough. I think we need to focus on our kids,” he said.
Electoral factors may have been in play for Wednesday’s vote.
In a column published by the conservative website Must Read Alaska, Bob Griffin of the Alaska Policy Forum opined that if the legislative session were to end without an education bill, the “outcome wouldn’t just harm our kids, it would also complicate Republican messaging in the next election, particularly with swing voters drawn to simplistic narratives.”
Before Wednesday’s House vote, the Alaska Senate needed to fix errors revealed after it approved HB 57 on Monday.  
There were two errors, lawmakers said. One involved the use of “shall” instead of “may” in a funding clause, raising concerns that it could run afoul of the Alaska Constitution’s prohibition on budget accounts for particular programs. 
The second involved a mistake on the effective date of a program that distributes grants to schools whose students reach certain benchmarks for reading skills. Those grants would begin with the 2026-2027 school year, not in January, halfway through the 2025-2026 school year.
The Senate had voted 19-1 in favor of HB 57, but its vote on Wednesday was 17-3.

The change was largely due to the way the new reading grant program is linked to passage of Senate Bill 113, a bill that updates corporate tax law pertaining to internet sales.
That change is expected to raise as much as $65 million per year, and proceeds would be directed toward the reading grant program. 
If there’s more than enough money to fund that program, the extra cash would be available for career and technical education programs in high schools.
“That’s going to be huge, I think,” said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka. 
Amid a state budget crunch, education “is the only area in the state where we’re increasing spending,” he said.
But some senators noted that if SB 113 doesn’t become law, the reading grants won’t just be defunded — they’ll be eliminated entirely.
“We are conditioning not only the funding of the reading grants … but the existence of the reading grants on another bill or policy,” said Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole.
For that reason, he said, he was unable to vote for the bill. 
“I do find it a little odd that we guarantee a ride to school, but we don’t have that guarantee that we’re going to incentivize the growth of reading,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, voted in favor of the bill on Monday but changed his vote on Wednesday, saying he wasn’t aware that the reading grants were contingent on the revenue bill.
“I’m kind of on a hope and a prayer that those things happen. … That makes it problematic for me,” he said.
Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, also voted in favor of the bill on Monday and against it on Wednesday for the same reason.
After Wednesday afternoon’s final vote, a House majority spokesperson said he expects HB 57 to be transmitted to Dunleavy on Thursday.
When the bill is sent, the governor will have until May 17 to sign the bill, veto it, or allow it to become law without his signature.
If he vetoes it, the Alaska Constitution calls for the Legislature to meet “immediately” for a vote to override or sustain the governor’s decision. Forty of 60 legislators, meeting in joint session, would have to vote for the bill in order to override a veto. 
Legislators have not overridden a veto since 2009.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Education Commissioner Deena Bishop sent a letter to superintendents statewide urging them to lobby legislators for the governor’s education policy items – or risk Dunleavy again vetoing an increase to school funding.
On Wednesday, some superintendents from districts across the state shared reactions to the commissioner’s veto threat, calling it “surprising,” “concerning” and “disappointing,” and called for state support for Alaska schools.
“We are at a make-or-break point,” said Roy Getchell, superintendent of the Haines School District in a phone interview, referring to many districts facing steep deficits, program cuts and school closures. “It’s not a game. It’s a reality. It’s something that all sides have worked hard and spent a lot of time on. It’s a nonpartisan issue.”
Bishop’s letter sent on Monday, as first reported by the Anchorage Daily News, came ahead of an Alaska Legislature vote on House Bill 57, which would permanently increase the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-student funding formula, by $183 million per year. The bill also added policy changes that many lawmakers saw as a compromise with Dunleavy after he vetoed a larger education boost on Apr 17 citing a lack of policy changes. On Wednesday, the Senate voted 17-3 and the House voted 31-8 in favor of the bill, sending it to Dunleavy. 
In the letter, Bishop listed Dunleavy’s policy priorities she said superintendents should speak for, including grants for districts showing student reading improvements, open enrollment for students across districts, and increased funding for homeschool programs. 
“​​If these critical reforms are not included, we risk repeating the challenges of previous years when the education bill — and its funding components — were vetoed. We also face the possibility that the funding element of the bill could be reduced or vetoed, as it was for FY24,” Bishop said, referring to Dunleavy cutting $87 million, half of on-time funding, approved by the Legislature in 2023. 
“Please prioritize reaching out to your House and Senate members as soon as possible,” she wrote. “A personal call or email stressing the importance of these reforms and their direct impact on your district will be highly effective.” 
Madeline Aguillard, superintendent of the Kuspuk School District in the middle Kuskokwim River region, expressed her concern in an email on Wednesday. 
“For a sitting commissioner to send a politically charged message that appears to threaten a gubernatorial veto, particularly one directed at local education leaders working tirelessly on behalf of their communities, was surprising and concerning to receive,” she said. 
She said Dunleavy’s policies are focused on urban and Railbelt districts, while rural districts like Kuspuk are in desperate need of a basic funding increase. “In Kuspuk, there are no charter or private schools—and there is no community interest in creating them. Our families want safe, fully staffed brick-and-mortar public schools. They deserve that,” she said. 
“Kuspuk families experience some of the highest poverty rates in the state. Our buildings are crumbling, our curriculum is over a decade old, and we are struggling to retain staff due to uncompetitive wages. Yet we continue to be an afterthought in these policy discussions,” she said. “Where do districts like ours fit into the state’s long-term vision for education?” 
Aguillard emphasized that while districts support the current legislation and funding increase, the proposal is still insufficient for schools grappling with almost a decade of flat funding, rising costs, inflation and deferred maintenance accumulating at schools. 
“This feels like the futures of our students are being used as bargaining chips in a game that overlooks the vast and varied realities of education across Alaska,” she said.
Shannon Harvilla, superintendent of the Bristol Bay Borough School District, also urged bipartisan support for the education funding bill.
“While I was surprised by Commissioner Bishop’s letter—particularly its tone and timing—I remain focused on what matters most: stability and opportunity for Alaska’s students,” Harvilla said in an email. “I’ve witnessed firsthand how a decade without meaningful BSA increases has strained our ability to recruit staff, balance budgets, and meet the needs of students. A bipartisan solution has been passed, and I believe now is the time for support—not political pressure.”
Harvilla also noted the advocacy efforts of the Alaska Superintendents’ Association, which “actively engaged in good-faith dialogue with both the Governor’s Office and the Legislature throughout this session,” he said. “Their goal, which I support, has been to advocate for a responsible compromise that reflects the realities we face at the local level.” 
Getchell, with the Haines Borough School District, expressed frustration with the ongoing political debate, and state leaders leaving schools without financial certainty almost at the end of the school year. “I don’t know on May 1 what my budget is going to be,” he said. “This isn’t about emails, it’s not about superintendents or governors or commissioners. It’s about 5 year olds and their futures. And I think they deserve better than this.”
Dunleavy’s office declined to comment on the letter or effort to pressure lawmakers. 
After legislators passed the funding bill, several members of the multipartisan House majority caucus expressed their concern at the letter.
Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, told reporters after the Legislature’s vote on Wednesday that she had a call from one superintendent that spoke in support of Dunleavy’s policy items, but declined to say who. 
House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, also commented on Bishop’s message.
“I don’t think her letter had any material effect,” he said. “I don’t remember, at least as a legislator, ever seeing an agency head or a department official attempting to get outside entities, such as school districts in this case, to actively work to persuade the Legislature to take the position. I don’t remember that happening.”
He added: “It surprised me to see that.”
The education funding measure, House Bill 57, is expected to be transmitted to Dunleavy on Thursday. He has until May 17 to sign the bill, veto it or allow it to become law without his signature.
If Dunleavy again vetoes the legislation, this time legislators said they may have the 40 votes to override it.  
It’s less clear whether the Alaska Legislature could override the threat in Bishop’s letter. If Dunleavy were to veto money needed to fully fund the new BSA, overriding that veto would require 45 votes, just three votes fewer than the combined number of House members and senators who voted for HB 57. 
In addition, lawmakers would have to call themselves into a special session or wait until the Legislature reconvenes in January. A special session wouldn’t be an easy ask, Edgmon said.

Current Nebraska law offers a narrow exception to the ban for people with one or two drug possession or drug use felony convictions. They can access Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, formerly known as food stamps, if they have completed a licensed and accredited treatment program.
Rountree’s bill would open the door for other felony drug offenders who currently can’t access SNAP benefits, as long as they’ve completed their sentence or are on parole or under post-release supervision.
An amendment that passed Wednesday, on a 32-14 vote, added a requirement that those with three or more felony drug convictions undergo a substance abuse treatment program to be eligible, unless a licensed health care provider determines that treatment is not necessary.

State Sens. Mike Jacobson of North Platte and Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln worked with Rountree on the amendment. Bosn said she did not think that food should be withheld as a form of punishment.
Jacobson said he felt strongly that a treatment component be included. He believes addiction is not a choice and is a disease that requires a constant and lifelong commitment to stay clean. 
“If we want to try to keep them from reoffending, we need to give them every opportunity to try to be gainfully employed. And that starts with putting food on the table,” Jacobson said. 
He said 152,000 Nebraskans currently receive SNAP benefits and the proposed legislation, if enacted, could add about 1,000 more. SNAP benefits are fully paid with federal funds, though administrative costs are split between the state and federal government.

A fiscal analysis said the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services could absorb the additional workload of administering the expansion without additional cost unless demand proved larger than anticipated.
State Sens. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha and Bob Andersen of Sarpy County were among those voicing continued opposition. On first reading April 10, the measure moved forward on a 32-5 vote. Kauth said a concern was taxpayers “being on the hook” for chronic offenders.
“At some point we have to put a barrier up that says, ‘If you continue to make these choices to engage in criminal activity, the taxpayers deserve to say no more,’” she said.
Andersen said the state pays for prosecution and incarceration. He added, ”At what point do we stop feeding the beast … At what point do we quit being enablers?”
  State Sen. Robert Dover of Norfolk. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)
State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk characterized himself as a conservative who does not promote rewarding people for bad behavior. He said, however, he believes punishment should not be prolonged after a person has paid their debt.
“If you think someone should suffer longer, increase the sentence then,” he said. “It should not just go on and on and on.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The Montana Senate started and ended the 69th session with moves that stripped power away from Republican leadership.
This session, a working majority of all Democrats and nine Republicans drove an agenda in the Senate.
Although that coalition didn’t always hold together, its members worked together this week in committee to push a change to the way the Senate appoints select committees. 
Previously, the president of the Senate had the power to appoint select committees during the interim, such as the previous, controversial Select Committee on Judicial Oversight and Reform.
However, Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, part of the working majority, proposed a change this week so that select committees be only formed with a majority vote of the Senate.
Republican leadership resisted the change in the Rules Committee on Tuesday — and with help from one Democrat — modified it so that those committees require three-fifths of the members in support instead of a simple majority.
That’s the change the full Senate approved 47-3 on Wednesday, but in committee, the proposal brought up ongoing political tensions in the Senate and the potential it could take several sessions to restore relationships.
“We are really going down a road of distrust in the Senate chambers,” said Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson. “We’re further perpetuating more distrust with something like this.”
In the Senate, Republicans have a 32-18 majority, but nine of them, “The Nine,” joined all Democrats off and on as a working majority through the session.
Responding to McKamey’s proposal in committee, Sen. Ellie Boldman, D-Missoula, repeatedly urged members of the committee to stick with the change McKamey presented, as members of the Republican majority made other proposals.
At one point, Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, floated the idea to not have any select committees at all to alleviate suspicions from both sides.
“I think it gets everybody out of the ‘Where’s the boogeyman’ idea,” said Glimm, part of the Republican majority.
The committee turned that down.
However, Hertz, also part of the Republican majority, proposed the idea that finally won out, to require approval from three-fifths of the Senate to create and appoint a select committee.
Sen. Derek Harvey, D-Butte, bucked his party in committee and supported the change. Even after Boldman called for a reconsideration, he held his position.
After the committee meeting, Harvey said he was convinced it was a good idea to have a higher threshold to encourage the factions in the Senate to work together.
“I felt that’s a fair way to do it,” Harvey said.
It means 10 Senators can call for the full body to be polled about forming a select committee, and 30 are required to agree to it.
“I think that’s the spirit of working together and moving forward and getting past this session,” Harvey said.
On the floor Wednesday, Majority Leader Tom McGillvray of Billings presented the proposal out of the Rules Committee as bipartisan and fair, a way to avoid “frivolous” committees and push for agreement.
“It would have to have buy-in from all parties, and we just thought it was a good solution to the question that we had about select committees,” McGillvray said.
On the floor, though, McKamey again tried to push her original proposal, although it didn’t pass. She earlier said she thought the three-fifths bar was too high to create a select committee.
Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, told the Daily Montanan he had’t planned the rule change, and he didn’t have any select committees in mind that he would want to call into action.
However, Flowers said he didn’t want to see a repeat of the most recent interim, with the judicial committee working on outcomes his caucus believed were predetermined and costly, and in which they did not participate.
“I do see the value of not giving the president the opportunity to kind of unilaterally create these select committees based on what we saw in the last session,” Flowers said.
Flowers previously worked with The Nine to gain additional power under the Senate’s permanent rules, by requiring the Senate president to receive approval from the minority leader on the composition of conference committees,

Earle Fisher,,,,,https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/04/30/political-courage-or-corporate-convenience-rethinking-xai-in-memphis-blackest-communities/,"In recent weeks, billionaire Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, has found itself at the center of a mounting storm in Memphis.

(Photo by Apu Gomes/Getty Images)In recent weeks, billionaire Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, has found itself at the center of a mounting storm in Memphis. With plans to build and expand a massive data center in the heart of South Memphis — powered by methane gas turbines — this project has become a flashpoint in an ongoing struggle between corporate expansion and community protection.
I acknowledge the goodwill and benevolence of Mayor Paul Young. His intentions for Memphis are rooted in growth and opportunity. But good intentions are not enough when people’s health, lives and futures are on the line. I long for a level of political courage and ideological innovation in his administration’s business and public safety strategies. So far, we’ve seen too much political caution and not enough prophetic vision.
According to a report, xAI has already begun operations in the area, installing at least 35 methane gas turbines while only getting permits for 15. 
The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) has raised concerns about this saying that the scale of emissions from these turbines necessitates a “major source permit” due to the significant output of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and formaldehyde, both harmful pollutants.

These turbines are pumping pollution into the air of predominantly Black neighborhoods.  Communities like Boxtown and Coro Lake in Memphis’s 38109 ZIP code have long endured environmental racism, facing health risks from industrial pollution. Facilities such as Velsicol Chemical and Sterilization Services of Tennessee have been sources of contamination, affecting air and water quality in these predominantly Black neighborhoods. While the proposed Byhalia Pipeline was halted due to community activism, the lingering effects of these environmental injustices continue to impact residents’ well-being. 
And who’s holding the line for these communities?
Michelle Taylor, Director of the Shelby County Health Department, took the rare and courageous step of publicly challenging the mayor and the city to reconsider the public health implications of this project. She announced plans for a community meeting to address growing concerns, something she should be commended for in an era when transparency and integrity often come last.
Meanwhile, grassroots leaders like KeShaun Pearson and state Rep. Justin J. Pearson, co-founders of Memphis Community Against Pollution (MCAP), are mobilizing daily to resist this project and protect our people. Their warning is clear: this isn’t innovation—it’s environmental racism. Their organizing reminds us that community protection is a spiritual mandate, not just a political strategy.
On the other side of the argument, voices like Ted Townsend of the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce and Mayor Young tout the promise of jobs and increased tax revenue. These are the same arguments we’ve heard for decades — used to justify everything from highways that decimated Black neighborhoods to industries that poisoned our air and water. But no promise of economic gain can justify the human cost of unchecked corporate expansion.

This is not just about Musk. It’s about what — and who — our leaders are willing to sacrifice in the name of “progress.” Musk’s record of exploitation, labor abuse, and reckless innovation is well-documented. Beyond Memphis, Elon Musk’s ventures have raised environmental justice concerns in other communities. For instance, in South Texas, SpaceX’s operations have faced criticism for environmental impacts on local populations. Additionally, in Bastrop, Texas, The Boring Company — another Musk company —  has been cited for environmental violations related to its tunneling projects. These instances highlight a pattern where Musk’s companies have been scrutinized for their environmental practices in various regions. 
Memphis should not be the next experiment.
As recently reported, there is still time to reassess the viability and values of this project. We need the Shelby County Health Department, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, and/or the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a full environmental review. We need real community input — not just performative listening sessions. And we need city leadership that is willing to say no when the stakes are too high.
This isn’t just about the next election cycle. This is about the long-term well-being of our people—our elders, our children, our neighbors. We need leadership that does not put Black lives on the altar of economic speculation, or worse, on the chopping block of billionaire experimentation.
Memphis doesn’t need another corporate footprint.
Memphis needs visionaries.
Memphis needs defenders.
Memphis needs leaders who love our people more than they fear political fallout.
To the administration, the Chamber, and everyone watching: We’re not opposed to progress. We’re just not willing to pay for it with the health and safety of our people. If this is the future Memphis is building, it better be one that we all can live in — literally.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Elon-Musk.jpg,,,2025-04-30 22:03:35.492941

John Esp said he heard about a good trick to stop from getting emotional, as some senators and representatives delivered goodbye speeches on the final day of the 2025 Montana Legislature.
“If you clench your butt cheeks together, they will help with that problem,” said Esp, a Republican from Big Timber.
In the House, Rep. Mary Caferro shared in feeling emotional, saying she was grateful to the people who sent her to the Capitol, as she ran 13 times, and in four primaries.
“I’ve been offered hot tea on cold days and cold beer on warm days,” Caffero said. “People say, ‘What are you most proud of?’ and I say, ‘The people I represent.”
Wednesday, Esp, the “Dean of the Senate,” and Caferro, vice chairperson of the House Appropriations Committee, joined other termed-out legislators to give goodbye speeches on the Senate and House floors.
They thanked spouses, children, other family members, friends, constituents, and their colleagues at the Capitol. Esp did so as he learned the clenching trick “ain’t working,” but after 16 years of service, he had learned what was important.
“I’m convinced it’s the relationships we take home with us when we leave here,” Esp said.
At least in the Senate, the comments infused a warm tone in the chamber that was sometimes rare, and where divisive sentiments returned soon after, when a couple of Republicans characterized the session as a “failure.”
The work is by nature political, but Esp’s parting advice to legislators who would continue the job in the future, the “young guns,” as Sen. Susan Webber described, was to support each other.
“Give each other grace. Hold each other up,” Esp said.
In the House, several legislators also said their goodbyes, and it included some singing. Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka, sang during his final speech on the House floor, a song from Jack Gladstone, a noted Montanan musician.
He said the song was better shared around a campfire or bedtime for his children, but he sang, and he sang beautifully.
“Maybe I didn’t show it,” Duram said. “But I’ve always been overwhelmed with the talent in this room.”
Leadership in the House thanked their long-time members, bringing several representatives to tears.
In the Senate, Sen. Shane Morigeau, D-Missoula, asked that the “dean” torch, an honorary title given to the longest serving member, be passed to Sen. Jonathan Windy Boy, D-Box Elder, a lawmaker of 13 sessions, and President Matt Regier greeted him as such.
“Welcome, Dean Windy Boy,” said Regier, R-Kalispell.
Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, the highest-ranking elected Democrat in Montana, said he brought values to the work that he had learned from his parents and applied the ones he learned in Ovando as a young man working outside many years ago.
He said Montanans care about land, water and critters, and they care about each other.
“They care about their friends and neighbors and communities, and they’re always there for them,” said Flowers, D-Bozeman. “In simple terms, what that taught me is that Montanans take care of each other.”
In a gesture he returned, Flowers gave a tie to Republican Sen. Russ Tempel, of Chester, another outgoing senator, a tie Flowers said he had bought for his wife’s memorial.
Flowers said once he had complimented Tempel’s tie, and Tempel had loosened it and handed it over to him. Flowers wore that tie Wednesday.
Webber, a Democrat from Browning, said her service had been “exhilarating” and “exasperating,” and always a mystery that turned out well in the end.
On the final day, Webber extended an invitation to every senator with whom she’d served in the session to her lake cabin, and she warned everyone who might visit about Native American hospitality, or “protocol.”
“As an Indian person, be prepared to be fed,” Webber said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4068-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 21:01:26.107517

Listen below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get podcasts.This week marks the 25th anniversary of the historic passage of the civil unions law in Vermont. On April 25, 2000, after a remarkable four-month marathon of public hearings, legislative maneuvering, protests, counter-demonstrations and statewide soul-searching, the Vermont House of Representatives voted 79-68 to pass the civil unions bill, the most sweeping grant of rights to gay couples in the nation.The law allowed same-sex couples to form civil unions, the legal equivalent of heterosexual marriage. Gov. Howard Dean signed it into law the next day.Rep. Bill Lippert was the lone openly gay Vermont legislator in 2000 and led the fight for passage of civil unions and later same-sex marriage. I was a reporter covering these historic events for Mother Jones. Lippert invited me onto the House floor moments after civil unions passed in 2000 to interview him and other supporters of the bill. I described how Lippert made a beeline across the House floor to thank Rep. Bill Fyfe, an 84-year-old former jail warden and Republican state representative from Newport City. His wife was in the hospital, and Fyfe was due to have surgery the following day. But he made sure to be in the Statehouse to cast his vote for civil unions.I asked Fyfe why he had voted for the bill. He looked at me through his thick glasses and his eyes began to water. “Because he’s one of my better friends here,” he said, motioning to Lippert. “And there were two ladies who were my next-door neighbors for many years …” He broke into a soft sob. “They were treated terrible. I’m just glad I could do something to help.”Lippert squeezed Fyfe’s shoulder to comfort him, “People can be cruel, Bill,” Lippert said.Vermont’s civil unions law passed four months after the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in Baker v. Vermont that gay and lesbian couples were entitled to the same legal rights and benefits of marriage as heterosexual couples. The court ordered the Vermont legislature to craft a law that would satisfy the ruling, either by legalizing same-sex marriage or by creating an equivalent partnership structure. The decision, wrote Chief Justice Jeffrey Amestoy, “is simply a recognition of our common humanity.”Vermont’s civil unions law was a tipping point for the national movement for LGBTQ+ rights. In 2009, Vermont became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage through an act of the legislature, overriding a gubernatorial veto to do so.In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4, in the landmark case Obergefell v. Hodges, that same-sex couples could wed throughout the country. Today, LGBTQ+ rights are under attack. President Donald Trump has targeted transgender people with a slew of executive orders. Hundreds of bills aimed at restricting LGBTQ+ rights have been introduced in state legislatures and in Congress. Many people fear that a conservative U.S. Supreme Court could roll back LGBTQ+ rights, including the right to marry.Bill Lippert was living in Philadelphia when he first visited Vermont in 1972 to hike the Long Trail. He had just come out and recalled that he had trouble finding even one other gay man in the state. Lippert became active in Vermont’s small gay rights movement and went on to serve 28 years in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1994 to 2022 as the representative from Hinesburg. He served as chair of the House Judiciary Committee for a decade and then chaired the House Health Care Committee.Lippert, 75, is now retired and working on preserving Vermont LGBTQ+ history, including recounting his own experiences as a gay activist and gay legislator in Vermont.Lippert acknowledged that winning civil unions was viewed by some gay rights advocates — including lead attorney (now federal judge) Beth Robinson — as a defeat.Lippert said that he knew that “this fight for marriage equality in Vermont was going to be the biggest gay rights fight perhaps of our lifetime.” But he said that as a legislator for six years, “I could tell what was achievable and what wasn’t. It was clear (that) full marriage equality in the year 2000 was not feasible. It was not going to happen.”Lippert insisted that civil unions “was an important step that brought us ultimately to full marriage equality.” And he was determined to build that bridge.“When civil unions passed, I made a personal commitment to myself that if I could continue to be re-elected, I would stay in the Legislature until we achieved full marriage equality, and that happened in 2009,” he said.Lippert says that today’s political attacks on trans people has a familiar ring. “Trans people are being used as a target because it’s the ‘unknown,’” he said. “Gay and lesbian people used to be the scary unknown, but that doesn’t work anymore in the same way.”I asked Lippert what concerns him most today. “The taking away of our basic democratic rights,” he said. “The shocking willingness to detain and deport people who have every right to be here because they’ve been granted that right.”“I am an optimist by nature, but this is a frightening time, and I’ve participated in more protests and demonstrations in the last month than I had in the last 10 years,” he said. “And I think it’s important that we do that. We deserve to have the country that some of us have fought for … by fighting for civil rights, for LGBTQ+ rights, rights for women, rights for religious freedom.”The passage of civil unions came at a price. Seventeen legislators who supported civil unions in 2000 were defeated in elections the following November as part of the “Take Back Vermont” movement. Lippert takes inspiration from those elected officials.“One of the lessons that I take from civil unions is that there are still people of tremendous personal moral courage and political courage,” Lippert said. He mentioned defeated Republican legislators John Edwards, Marion Milne, Diane Carmolli and Bill Fyfe.“When you’re not part of the same ‘despised minority’ but you say it’s wrong to have discrimination against them, it’s wrong to be prejudiced against them — you get attacked as well. And they did so,” he said.“They did the right thing. They chose to stand up,” Lippert said. “That girds my hopefulness.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Conversation: Bill Lippert on the 25th anniversary of Vermont’s landmark civil unions law and the backlash against LGBTQ+ people.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lippert-cropped-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C698&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 21:01:26.107517

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderDozens of Vietnamese Americans gathered at a senior center in Norcross Wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of what Von Tran called a dark day in history.
“It’s a day of suffering, of separations of family, of death, of thousands and hundreds of thousands killed and forced into reeducation camps and imprisoned, Holocaust-style, if you can imagine that,” said Tran, CEO of First Senior Center of Georgia, which hosted the event. “Some were imprisoned for five years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, trying to brainwash them into communist ideology.”
In Vietnam, April 30, 1975, is celebrated as Reunification Day, when North Vietnamese troops captured Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, uniting the nation under socialist rule. But to members of the Vietnamese diaspora who fled South Vietnam after its fall, April 30 is marked as the Fall of Saigon, a day to lament the end of South Vietnam and to remember the people who died fighting for the nation.

Tran is part of that diaspora. She left Vietnam in 1983 at 9 years old, packed on a fishing boat with more than 60 others, including her parents and five siblings.
Tran said her family often relied on charity to make sure everyone was fed during her early days in the U.S.
“I went to the food pantry at the church every Sunday, six of us, to get six chickens so my mother would be able to cook for us, because my father in 1985 was only making $3.54 an hour,” she said. “He couldn’t feed seven mouths. I jokingly say all the time, that I’ve been converted so many times at church pantries, from Catholic to Lutheran to Methodist to, you name it, just for a chicken.”
Thanks to those charity chickens and a lot of hard work, Tran found success in the business world and now runs her own food pantry out of the senior center, delivering literal tons of food to thousands of households every week, with a special focus on seniors.
In addition to the food bank and recreational facilities, the center has areas for arts and crafts as well as medical services, including acupuncture. While the ceremony honoring the fall of Saigon took place, a few old timers sat in the back and played board games like xiangqi, or Chinese chess.
Many of the people who fled Vietnam around the fall of Saigon are getting older, and the center helps with tasks like translation, transportation and signing up for government assistance programs.

“A lot of them are low-income, so we cater to those who don’t have the means to – whether because of a language barrier or transportation limitations – take them to doctor appointments, schedule a doctor appointment for them, apply for all the different social services, food stamps, Medicaid, Medicare, and translation, interpretation. We also give them coffins. We bury them, give them a cemetery plot. We cremate them. These are all free services.”
Many of the people who came out Wednesday were members of South Vietnam’s military, including some who wore their old uniforms. They saluted the flag of South Vietnam and delivered speeches and sang songs in Vietnamese. Members carrying battery-powered candles walked to the front of the center’s common area and placed them on a large map of Vietnam.
Tom Nguyen, a retired mechanical engineer, served six years in the South Vietnamese Navy, but he came to the ceremony in a suit and tie instead of his fatigues.
“I’m glad the war is over,” he said. “I’m glad that the future is growing better over there and over here, because I was there to see many people killed. There’s no reason for that. I hate war. I hate war. It just destroys things and communities and the economy.”
Nguyen has lived in the U.S. since 1975 and Georgia since 1978. Every now and then when he speaks, a little bit of a southern drawl rises up from beneath his Vietnamese accent. If you ask him about it, he’ll smile and pull down the collar of his shirt.
“Can’t you see my neck is red?” he says with a laugh.
Nguyen may not be American by birth, but he’s a red-blooded patriot. He said he wants the next generation of Vietnamese Georgians to honor their roots but also appreciate their new country.
“We’re trying to tell them today is a better life for you, especially you here in America, you have a better future, you have a long life, and you have education, you can perform, and you can achieve as you wish, because here is opportunity for everybody, America is number one, I put it that way,” he said.
Hanh Kim Dang, a realtor and past president of Vietnamese Community of Georgia, said she’s also thinking about the next generation. She got out of Vietnam April 26, 1975, just days before the fall of Saigon.
She says she counts herself lucky that she and her sister were able to fly out of Vietnam because her aunt worked for the U.S. government. Many others made a perilous trip by boat or on foot.
Dang, who was 20, had studied some English in school, but she was far from fluent.
“It was very rough,” she said. “I was in the third year of law school, then I went back here and started all over again. I tried to go to high school because that’s where I thought I could learn English and use it more to get better. But they said, no, your age, you have to go to community college.”
Dang turned that community college education into a degree in information and computer science from Georgia Tech. After a 19-year career, she entered the business world and now owns several nail salons and food courts.
Dang’s three children are all in their thirties now. They’re all conversational in Vietnamese, if not fluent.
“When they were growing up, I hired nannies who were Vietnamese, and I told them, please use Vietnamese language at home, so they pick it up, so they can save it, but it’s more like daily conversation, not writing, not literature,” she said.
“They have some understanding of why we’re here, but understanding deeply the reason why we sacrificed, we left everything behind, it’s hard for them because they’re born here,” she added. “They adopted the culture, language, everything here, but they do understand, they see what the people have been through through photos, videos, movies.”

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee narrowly approved a bill on Wednesday that changes some of the rules pertaining to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles amid some final minute dramatics that required one lawmaker to return to the meeting to cast his vote.
The House Judiciary Committee approved SB 324, sponsored by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, by a vote of 8-7. Initially, the measure would have failed because of a tied vote, but Rep. Jim Hill, R-Odenville, the committee chair, requested that someone reach out to Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, to return to the committee after leaving to cast the tie-breaking vote that ultimately led to bill getting approved by the committee.
“I got some work to do,” Chambliss said in an interview after the vote. “I will work with all the interested parties. You know, I have seen bills that are further apart than this one. We sit down and talk through it all and see what everyone can live with.”

The vote came a day after the Senate voted to cut funding for the board in the final version of the General Fund budget and made its remaining funding contingent on updating the parole guidelines which are used to determine whether an applicant should be granted parole.
SB 324 increases the number of people who can serve on the parole board from three to five; moves the power to appoint the chair from the governor to the board itself and establishes guidelines for the board when they set the next parole hearing for applicants who are denied.
The original version of the bill Chambliss filed remained largely intact when it was approved by the Senate last week except for a single amendment proposed by Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, pertaining to the timeline for nominating a candidate to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.
The board members, regardless of whether their terms have expired or not, will be appointed by the Governor’s Office based on a list of names from a nominating committee comprising the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House and President Pro Tempore of the Senate.
SB 324 also lays out timelines for parole hearings. For those serving up to 20 years in prison, the parole board may set the next hearing no more than two years from the time that the person’s parole application was denied.
Those serving a life sentence after committing one or more violent Class A felonies are permitted another hearing within 10 years of being denied. People who are considered for parole for medical reasons may receive another parole hearing within 180 days after the parole board rejects their application.
Others are eligible for another parole hearing with five years of getting rejected for parole by the Board.
Chambliss introduced SB 324 Wednesday by referring to a meeting of the Joint Prison Oversight Committee in October 2023 in which Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles Chair Leigh Gwathney answered lawmakers’ questions in ways they considered meandering or unresponsive.
Chambliss characterized the meeting as a “little bit of a fiasco.”
“The law says that those guidelines are to be updated periodically,” Chambliss said to the committee during the meeting Wednesday. “And the law says that they have to do that. Well, they have not done that. As a matter of fact, they only adhere to the guidelines 20% of the time.”
According to data obtained from the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, the conformance rate, the percentage that the parole board’s decisions match with Bureau’s recommendations based on the guidelines, is between 22%-27%.
The Alabama Attorney General’s Office publicly stated that it opposed the legislation.
“Needless to say, the makeup of the parole board is a very delicate thing,” said Katherine Robertson, chief counsel for the Alabama Attorney General’s Office. “As we know from recent history, it has a very direct implications on public safety.”
She also referred to the General Fund budget.
“There was an amendment added to the General Fund budget that would address the guidelines issue that was added by the Senate that says the Board doesn’t get their money until they do what he (Chambliss) is talking about on the guidelines,” Robertson said. “I am sure they have gotten the message when it comes to that.”
Former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Sue Cobb supported the legislation.
“We want the state to stop wasting money holding individuals who have proven they are no longer the same person when they were convicted,” she said. “And have either through their health, or their prison record, demonstrated they would be almost impossible to reoffend.”
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, a longtime critic of the board, was among the strongest supporters of the legislation.
“This is about the ability to have oversight over the system that could potentially go out of control either way,” he said in an interview following the meeting. “Set aside how you feel about releases, and who is getting out and who is not, just look at how broken the process is.”
Other committee members voted against the bill in the hopes that others would have more time to provide feedback.
“I do think this is the makings of a good bill,” said Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne. “I do think this is something I am very eager to hopefully get together to get more people on and have a conversation. I do think we have to bring more people to the table, specifically VOCAL (Victims of Crime and Leniency).”
VOCAL opposed the legislation.

Curtis Trent, a Republican from Springfield, introduces a bill on the Senate floor during the 2024 legislative session. This year, he is carrying a bill from the House that would allow students to enroll in neighboring districts (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The split among Senate Republicans over a bill allowing Missouri students to enroll in neighboring school districts widened to a chasm they could not bridge Wednesday after the legislation was tied to an obligation to fully fund public education.
The state Senate debated the legislation, dubbed “open enrollment,” for five hours, finally setting it aside when no agreement could be reached.
When the bill passed the Missouri House in March for the fifth consecutive year, 22 of the chamber’s 110 Republicans voted against it. A similar split in the Senate, combined with Democratic opposition, led to Wednesday’s impasse.
The debate marked the first time it reached full Senate.
The bill’s House sponsor, state Rep. Brad Pollitt, a Republican from Sedalia, has fine-tuned the bill over the years to settle concerns and win over GOP skeptics.
At its core, the legislation would allow school districts to enroll students outside of its boundaries to fill open seats and collect the state funding for those students. Provisions like the maximum number of students that could leave their home district each year have changed over time, with the House passing a 3% cap on departing students and a Senate committee giving the cap room to expand to 5% in some situations.
Any changes made in the Senate will need to win approval in the House, where the margin is very slim. And the bill brought to up for debate Wednesday by state Sen. Curtis Trent, a Springfield Republican, is loaded with changes reaching into other K-12 education matters.
Pollitt told The Independent that he was part of discussions in both the Senate committee substitute and the floor substitute, confident the changes wouldn’t kill the legislation if it returns to the House.
Behind closed doors, the 22-page bill approved by the House ballooned into a 107-page education package negotiated without input from Senate Democrats.
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, said he received a copy of the bill shortly before the Senate convened.
“This large piece of policy is coming before the body, and we haven’t even had a chance to have input on it, which we’ve done in the past on numerous big bills around here that you know about,” Beck said. “We are basically shut out of this process.”
Trent said school districts and other stakeholders were consulted, adding that Beck could offer amendments on the floor.
Beck challenged Trent’s confidence in the negotiations.
“I don’t think there’s consensus in your own caucus on this bill,” he said, saying Senate Republicans had asked him if he was going to “kill this thing.”
The division emerged when state Sen. Lincoln Hough, the chamber’s other Springfield Republican, added provisions that would pause open enrollment in years that the state does not fully fund the formula that determines state aid for public schools. The pause, under Hough’s additions, would also occur if teacher salary grants or district transportation costs were not fully funded.
“This body has a tendency to pass laws and then not necessarily… financially support the legislation that we adopt,” he said.
Hough, the appropriations committee chairman, is the Senate’s top voice on spending. His amendment, he said, would ensure that future state lawmakers adequately support funding that is key to public education and the operation of an open-enrollment system.
Trent called the amendment a “special carve out” that could hinder future senators.
“I don’t think that we should second guess the judgment of future general assemblies, nor should we hold a good idea hostage to arbitrary standards such as this,” he said.
The narrow votes on Hough’s proposals showed the depth of the split. The transportation funding requirement was added on a 15-13 vote, then it and the other two requirements were approved 14-13.
The standing division vote did not record individual members’ positions, but objections were raised when state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, refused to take sides. Coleman raised a “point of order,” and Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin of Shelbina ruled that Coleman was within the rules.
Pollitt did not comment on Hough’s amendments, saying only that he feels confident in the financial considerations because districts have to opt in to participate.
“If they take kids one year and finance has changed drastically, then come around November 1 the next year, they can say, ‘You know what, we’re not going to opt in again,’” Pollitt said. “But those kids (already enrolled) get to stay.”
Before the bill was laid over, Democratic Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern of Kansas City offered an amendment that would exclude charter schools from open enrollment. The inclusion of charters was not part of the version approved by the House and was added in the Senate Education Committee.
Pollitt said he wasn’t opposed to including charter schools in the legislation, since lawmakers added provisions that would protect local tax dollars from going to students outside the district who enroll in a charter school.
Nurrenbern’s amendment did not come to a vote.

(File photo)The North Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would allow employees and volunteers of K-12 private schools to carry concealed firearms on school property Tuesday afternoon.
Senate Bill 280 would allow employees and volunteers at these schools to possess handguns and stun guns with the consent of school administrators and written notice to parents. They must hold a concealed carry permit and complete additional training before becoming eligible to possess firearms on school property.
The proposal is part of a larger trend in the North Carolina legislature in which Republican lawmakers have sought to respond to the rise in school shootings by equipping adults with firearms and defensive implements. A bill with a similar approach passed the House Judiciary 2 Committee a day prior allowing schools to store tasers, pepper spray, and other “less-than-lethal” weapons in biometric safes.
A separate provision in SB 280 allows for firearms to be carried by attendees of worship services, funerals, weddings, and other religious events held at places of worship located on the grounds of private schools at the discretion of school administrators.
Sen. Steve Jarvis (R-Davidson) said the bill “balances safety with individual rights” through stringent criteria for training, permitting, and school oversight.
“This bill simply strengthens the safety in North Carolina’s private schools while respecting the unique needs of our communities,” Jarvis said. “It allows private school employees or volunteers with concealed carry permits to carry firearms on school grounds, but only with the explicit authorization of the school board and/or the administration director.”
Sen. Sydney Batch (D-Wake) proposed adding a requirement that private school employees and volunteers affected by the bill be vetted against the state’s Responsible Individuals List, which tracks adults implicated in the abuse and serious neglect of children. Jarvis said he would follow up with her suggestion at some point in the future.
Democratic lawmakers raised concerns about the implications that other bills around concealed carry would have on these new exceptions. Sen. Terence Everitt (D-Wake) noted that the Senate passed a bill allowing permitless concealed carry in March, warning that this would undermine SB 280’s reliance on permit training and safety requirements.
Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) expressed concerns about the lack of an age requirement, noting that the permitless carry bill would allow 18-year-olds to carry concealed firearms — and by extension, SB 280 could allow them to bring them into schools.
Robert Ryan, an attorney with the General Assembly’s Legislative Affairs Division, said that even with the existence of permitless concealed carry, this bill would still require a permit for individuals to carry weapons onto school grounds — leaving intact the training and age requirements. North Carolina would continue issuing concealed carry permits even under the March bill to maintain reciprocity with states that do not have permitless carry.
Among the speakers during the public comment part of the meeting were leaders at religious private schools who urged lawmakers to pass the bill so they and their students could feel safe.
“We do everything that we can within the law to protect these precious children from danger,” said Matthew Floyd, a faculty member at Greenville Christian Academy. “We love these children as our own and many are willing and able to be trained, you know, with rigorous training to be able to be an immediate line of defense against the horrible thought of a gunman entering the property.”
Ron Baity, a pastor who founded a Wilkes County Christian private school in the 1970s, said “every day we are horrified” at the prospect that a shooter could attack their school.
“I hear it said that innocent people could be killed if a shooter comes on the property and our staff is armed,” Baity said. “The truth of the matter is, if we have no resistance against the individual who’s armed, he can kill all of our staff, he can kill all of our students, and we have no way to protect anyone.”
Amanda Lierman, a substitute teacher in Wake County with Moms Demand Action, said bringing guns into schools would only place an “undue burden” on school staff. She was the only member of the public to speak against the bill.
“My friend and her sons experienced a shooting at their elementary school last year, when a staff administrator was shot and killed by their ex-husband,” Lierman said. “My friend described the running students and the chaos that ensued — having more guns among that chaos would have increased the risk of more casualties.”
After passing the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday, SB 280 will next be heard by the Senate Rules Committee, where it can then be scheduled for a vote by the full Senate.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/return-to-school.jpg,,,2025-04-30 21:01:26.107517

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)The 69th Montana Legislature adjourned the 2025 session on Wednesday – the 85th day of the session – after finishing up work on a property tax relief package and a litany of speeches by outgoing lawmakers.
The final day was relatively subdued, as both chambers took final votes and waited for the pomp and circumstance that accompanies sine die — the motion to adjourn — which included a chamber-wide rendition of “God Bless America” on the Senate side led by Sen. Denley Loge, a St. Regis Republican.
Legislators offered advice for those who will take the torch in the future, along with pleas for the current Montana Legislature continue, because it had come up short on the budget and property taxes, according to some frustrated Republicans.
Sen. Butch Gillespie, R-Ethridge, said the diversity of views in the Senate is positive, and he encouraged the body to work together in the future.
“For sure, we don’t accomplish much by constant turf wars,” Gillespie said. “Think about that one a second.”
However, when the motion to end was made in the upper chamber, the Senate voted it down not once, but twice, before eventually gaveling out — one final display of the tensions that defined the session in the upper chamber.

Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, stood to oppose adjournment, calling the session, and the largest bills passed by the Legislature, failures.
“Five days early? We’re going to quit because we’re done? I don’t think we’ve even showed up,” Zolnikov said. 
More conservative Republicans in the chamber were frustrated to see their majority split and felt cut out of the conversation around major legislative initiatives, including the budget which many decried as bloated. 
“This is supposed to be a decentralized process. Fifty people from 50 different areas, each representing 20,000 people each, so everyone in this state has a voice, through us,” Zolnikov continued. “And we gave that away.” 
 
The 2025 session saw 1,759 bills, resolutions and other measures introduced and debated by lawmakers — a record number. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Legislature had sent 484 to the desk of Gov. Greg Gianforte, with another 322 on their way.
The laws would be celebrated, derided, and some will likely be fought in court in the future, and in the Senate, Sen. John Esp, R-Big Timber, offered a nod to the ups and downs.
“There are days in this building that you’re going to want to cry,” Esp said. “And there’s days in this building that you’ll be moved to laughter. Sometimes you get to do a little of each on the same day.”
Among the major pieces of legislation that passed the Legislature was Medicaid expansion, the largest income tax cut in state history, historic investments in education, and a property tax relief package. 
There were also several bills that affect transgender individuals, characterized as erasing and harming them by opponents, including one that has already landed in court. Other lawmakers lauded the same legislation as protecting children and women. Legislators also passed a series of bills changing the Montana Environmental Policy Act in response to the Held v. Montana suit, a historic lawsuit concerning the effects of climate change. 
But one of the defining features of the 2025 session was a rift in the Republican Caucus in the Senate that appeared 85 days ago when nine moderate Republicans joined Democrats to change the rules of the Senate to give their coalition more power. 
For the rest of the session, the Senate was effectively run by a working majority coalition that pushed through priority bills for Democrats and the Governor’s office, to the frustration of more conservative GOP members. Numerous times throughout the session, the Senate chamber erupted with accusations of betrayal between Republican camps and “baked in” votes that routinely passed 27-23 along the coalition line. 
Another defining moment was the censure of a sitting Senator, former Senate President Jason Ellsworth, R-Hamilton, who was kicked out of the chamber halfway through the session. The punishment, described as “everything but expulsion,” was a response to ethical violations Ellsworth committed by not disclosing a friendship he had when he signed a $170,100 state contract with a longtime business associate.

Despite the roller coaster of events throughout the session, Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said in a press conference following adjournment that he was still satisfied with the work his caucus accomplished.
“There are many reasons for Senate Republicans to hold their heads high,” Regier said. “And we will look forward to continuing our efforts in the interim, and also in the next session.”
The GOP senators touted many of their wins from the session, including delivering a large income tax cut, bolstering election integrity, and leading the nation with new data privacy legislation.
“We’re not just protecting Montanas amid technological advancements, but also making sure that our state is open to cutting-edge innovations,” Senate Pro Tempore Ken Bogner, R-Miles City said. 
One area the Senate GOP said they fell short on was judicial reform — a key priority for the caucus at the start of the session. 
More than two dozen bills were introduced aimed at changing the judicial branch, but only a handful made it through the Legislature. Among those that failed were numerous attempts to make judicial elections partisan. 
“What we do have is a great foundation for the reform. I think that judicial reform is critical, continuously,” said Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, adding that efforts would continue in the next session. “We’re undaunted.”
Despite a long list of bills he considered wins, Regier stood with less than two dozen members of his caucus and called out the missing members of his party.
“I do believe the voters sent the Republican Party here to be in control, and from day one, it was not, and I don’t see that as sustainable. I think that in the future, the voters are going to speak their mind,” Regier said. “… I don’t believe the people will stand up for another session where the Democrat minority leader and his caucus controls the Senate.”
Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, said the session was one of the hardest he’s been a part of, but also one of the most effective — with Democrats pushing through substantially more legislation than anticipated. 
In a joint press conference with House Minority Leader Rep. Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, Flowers touted legislation protecting renters, and said every Democrat vote for Medicaid expansion was “critical,” painting it as a major win for the party.
“We didn’t just protect the program,” Flowers said. “We secured it permanently.”
Sullivan added that while the session wasn’t perfect, Montanans came out in a better place than they were before the session.
“This session, Montana Democrats stood firm in defending our fundamental freedoms under the Montana constitution and our Montana way of life,” Sullivan said. “When Republicans spent dozens and dozens of hours pushing bills to legislate every aspect of our lives, Democrats fought back.”

The Democrat leaders also highlighted legislation addressing the state’s affordable housing crisis that saw bipartisan support.
“It’s not fixed,” Flowers said. “But for the first time in a long time, we’re moving in the right direction for practical solutions and real funding.”
While bills pushed by the minority party could be at a higher risk of receiving a veto from the Republican governor, Flowers said he was confident many showcase shared priorities. 
“I think, frankly, many of our bills are consistent with the values that he described in his State of the State address, where he focused on child care and education,” Flowers said. “And I think he should appreciate what we’re bringing to his desk.”
Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle mentioned the possibility of the Legislature returning for a special session, most likely related to potential cuts from the federal government that could affect the state’s budget.
 
The Legislature’s lower chamber was comparatively calm, a testament to the steady, if unassuming, leadership of House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage. 
“When I gave my welcome speech, I said, I hope this body would rise above, would keep everything civil and that we would treat each other with respect, and the Montana way of hard work, honesty and neighborliness would guide our deliberations,” Ler told his colleagues on the House floor. “I believe we lived up to that.” 
 While some hardline Republicans felt cut out of the legislative process — and in the House, Speaker Ler said his door was open — he said the reality is bills need majorities in the chambers to pass, and then support from the governor.

Speaker Pro Tempore Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, said it’s a delicate balance to work on legislation that can, realistically, get across the finish line, and also ensure input.
Property tax relief was one measure that passed with substantial bipartisan support in the House, but some legislators expressed their displeasure about it, including that it could land in court.
Critics of the property tax reform said the content didn’t match the title of the bill, which could be unconstitutional, but supporters dismissed the accusation.
At least in the House, Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick said he would anticipate legal action following the session, given it hasn’t been unusual for bills to be challenged.
“I would assume there will be a lawsuit, since it’s lawsuit season now,” Fitzpatrick said.
However, he said legislators worked hard on property taxes from the start, through the very end of the session, and the package that passed reflects the areas of agreement.
“It was difficult. I think the product we finally got is just a reflection of the realities that compromise around here requires,” Fitzpatrick said.
The final hours on the House floor were joyous, and legislators animately said their goodbyes, took photos together and laughed as they cleared out their desks. They were slow to leave the chamber, and some representatives took in the moment.
“I’ll carry this experience with me forever, every debate, every challenge and every late night and every handshake across the aisle,” Ler said shortly before the session ended. “Thank you for trusting me. Thank you for believing in this institution. Thank you for meeting and for loving Montana enough to serve her.”

In the Senate, a flurry of votes in the final minutes offered a final glimpse of division in the chamber. 
Twice, Flowers sought to reconsider one last bill — an increased fee on luxury vehicles registered in the state — which one Senator said he had voted against at least a half dozen times already. 
Substitute motions to adjourn failed, the motion to reconsider the bill failed twice, but eventually the chamber reached consensus before boiling over.

And it may have been done to avoid putting Gov. Ron DeSantis in an awkward spot.
By a one-vote margin, the Senate on Wednesday shot down a move by organized medicine and business interests to place a $1 million cap on noneconomic damages in wrongful death cases involving medical malpractice.
After dispatching the amendment to HB 6017, (which was supported by Senate President Ben Albritton) the Senate agreed to roll the bill to third reading, a procedural move prepping it for final passage.  
But sponsor Sen. Clay Yarborough moved to temporarily pass the bill — pausing debate — “so we can continue to work on details related to the bill.”
The move, coming with just days left in session, suggests the legislation may be dead for the year.
The measure, one of several bills caught up in a tense behind-the-scenes fight involving trial attorneys, has drawn 80 lobbyist registrations, House records show.
  Speaker Daniel Perez via Florida House
A top priority for House Speaker Daniel Perez, HB 6017 eliminates a longstanding ban blocking  parents of single, childless, adult children from suing for noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering arising from alleged medical malpractice. 
Florida also bans adults (defined as 25 and older) from pursuing wrongful death claims for single parents who die from medical malpractice, and the bill would remove that ban, too. The Legislature adopted the ban during the 1990s as the state wrestled with rising malpractice premiums.
There has been a concerted effort in recent years, though, to eliminate the ban. And that push has coincided with recent efforts by organized medicine, business, and insurance lobbyists to reinstate caps on pain and suffering in all medical malpractice lawsuits. 
Florida had previously passed caps but the Florida Supreme Court in 2017 ruled them unconstitutional. The makeup of the high court has changed since then, with the majority of the justices now appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The medical community is eager to put the rejuggled court to the test.
DeSantis has been harshly critical of the trial bar but vetoing the bill would disappoint grieving family members.

Throughout the 2025 session, Yarborough has steadfastly opposed linking damages caps in exchange for eliminating the ban on some medical malpractice cases.
So it was quite the surprise when Yarborough sponsored the caps.

“I think you’re being held hostage in negotiating with terrorists right now, “ Sen. Jason Pizzo said, explaining that the quid pro quo “does not bode well for the policy at large.”
After the Senate narrowly voted down the caps, Pizzo pointed into the chamber gallery to those who had been pushing to change the law limiting medical malpractice lawsuits.
He said that legislators should send DeSantis a “clean” bill and force him to explain to family members backing the bill why he was opposed to it.
One of those supporters is Cindy Jenkins from Jacksonville, who said the amendment to limit noneconomic caps on all medical malpractice cases should have been its own separate bill.
“To smack an amendment on today and kill our good bill that was literally on track to pass and go to the governor’s desk is wrong,” said Jenkins, whose 25-year-old daughter died from alleged malpractice. 
“There’s three branches of government for a reason. If they’re concerned that the governor would veto it when it hits his desk, let it get there and let him veto it. We will handle that separately.”
Tallahassee resident Beth Young said her mother died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital in 2023  after falling into a coma. She blamed the death on negligence and understaffing but she was banned from filing a lawsuit because of the law. 
HB 6017 wouldn’t help Young but she said it’s not about her or her family.
“I just want all people to be able to get justice. It’s about accountability, it’s not even about the money.”

CHATHAM — As a central Illinois community mourns the deaths of three children and a teen counselor killed Monday when a vehicle crashed into the building that housed their after-school program, it has rallied around survivors.

Ainsley Johnson, 8; Kathryn Corley, 7; Alma Buhnerkempe, 7, all of Chatham, and counselor Rylee Britton, 18, of Springfield, died from blunt force trauma in the accident.

“As we mourn this unimaginable loss, we recognize the pain and grief that many are experiencing,” Becca Lamon, superintendent for the Ball Chatham School District wrote on the district’s webpage. “We are all hurting. We understand that yesterday’s tragedy was difficult to comprehend and process. In times like these it is important that we lean on one another for strength and support.”

Police said a black Jeep driven by Marianne Akers, of Chatham, left the road for unknown reason and traveled through a field, crossed a street and a parking lot then hit the east side of a building that housed YNOT Outdoors, which stands for Youth Needing Other Things, an after-school camp in Chatham.

The car drove through the building, striking several children and workers, before it exited the other side, went across a basketball court and hit a pole near the town’s water tower. Children were in a gym area when the Jeep went through the building.

Illinois State Police continue to investigate the cause of the crash but said it was not a targeted attack. ISP confirmed Wednesday that there is surveillance video of the crash.

Akers was not injured but was taken to a local hospital for evaluation on Monday afternoon. No charges have been filed as of Wednesday.

Six children were hospitalized after the crash. Two have been released, according to Illinois State Police, while four remain hospitalized. A GoFundMe account was established for 7-year-old Ella Orsi, who was injured in the crash, to help with medical costs.

Ella sustained facial fractures, a broken jaw, damaged teeth, brain swelling and brain bleeding and is in the pediatric intensive care unit, according to Casey Sitko, who posted on the fundraising site.

“At this time, plastic surgery/surgeries will be required, but it appears as though any brain surgery will be avoided. She is intubated and medicated so she can rest and recover,” Sitko wrote.

Ella has been responsive and communicating by squeezing her parents’ hands, according to the latest update by Sitko.

The Glenwood High School Student Council raised more than $150,000 to help with funeral costs, according to the fundraising site.

Chatham has a population of around 15,000 people and is 12 miles from the Capitol in Springfield. Due to the village’s proximity to Springfield, a large number of state employees live in Chatham, located south on Interstate 55.

Akers, of Chatham, is herself a state employee. She is an office associate in the Illinois Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Business Services. She formerly served as an office associate at the Illinois State Police but resigned in 2018 after a 12-year tenure.

Under Illinois law, a driver has a duty to report a medical condition that could cause loss of consciousness or any other loss of ability to safely operate a motor vehicle within 10 days of the driver becoming aware of the condition.

The Illinois Secretary of State stated it could not comment on whether Akers has previously filed a medical report as that is confidential information.

Chatham Schools canceled school through Friday.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the village rallied to show support for the families that were affected. The mayor of Chatham ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff. Residents made T-shirts displaying the slogan “We Are Chatham Strong” and gave the proceeds to the families.

Red, the school color, was seen throughout the village. Ribbons adorned trees and light poles. Red signs were planted in front lawns. Locals wore red shirts throughout the day and at the vigils.

Chatham Police Department posted a video of a candlelight vigil held for the victims on Tuesday, and another vigil was scheduled for Wednesday night.

Community members shared several Facebook posts  urging residents to donate blood. By Tuesday morning, all of the time slots were booked until Friday.

Counselors provided free therapy and counseling for children and parents. A local nursery provided free childcare for parents needing “time for self-care.” Families organized to make or provide meals for families of children who attended the after-school program.

Some local bars and restaurants donated a portion of their sales to families impacted by the crash. Others offered free meals to first responders, impacted families, and locals who donated blood.

During lunchtime on Wednesday, a real estate firm rented a local trampoline park for four hours, allowing children from the Chatham School District to play during that time for free.

A Chatham ice cream shop hosted an event for children with a school counselor and therapy dog. The children were encouraged to write messages on the sidewalk outside in chalk to those who were killed and injured.

On Tuesday, a neighboring intermediate school observed a moment of silence for Chatham School District’s loss, as their students wore red to show their support.

Glenwood athletes planned to meet at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Community Park to play games with younger children from the village.

A Linktree page was made for locals to house all additional links for other information, fundraisers, events, and community resources for Chatham residents.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Celebrating his 100th day in office Tuesday, President Donald Trump invoked a recent brutal kidnapping case in western Washington to justify his rush to deport Venezuelan immigrants.
The day after Trump’s inauguration in January, three men abducted a 58-year-old woman outside her Burien apartment, robbing and shooting her before leaving her for dead along Interstate 90 in Kittitas County, prosecutors allege. Authorities say the men drilled into the woman’s hand with a power drill to get her to reveal her bank card PIN and phone passcode.
King County prosecutors have charged two of the suspects, as of Wednesday.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the two men so far charged in the case, who are both Venezuelan citizens, have “alleged ties to the notorious Tren de Aragua gang.” ICE has lodged immigration detainers on them so federal immigration agents can take custody if King County releases them, a spokesperson confirmed. 
But under state law and county code, the jail can’t release inmates to federal immigration authorities without a warrant.
This case, along with another in Chicago, provided Trump’s rationale Tuesday for using a 1798 law to deport non-citizens without due process. 
“That’s why we’ve invoked the Alien Enemies Act to expel every foreign terrorist from our soil as quickly as possible,” Trump said to cheers at his Michigan rally. 
“We’re just not taking this crap anymore. We can’t,” he continued.
Last month, Trump formally invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used law that allows the president to bypass immigration courts to deport people from a “hostile nation or government.” The president can use the statute in times of war or an “invasion” of the United States.
In his March 15 executive order, Trump argued Tren de Aragua members “unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.”
The American Civil Liberties Union quickly challenged the order. In response, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., barred deportation of Venezuelans on Alien Enemies Act grounds. The judge also ordered the Trump administration to turn around planes already en route to a prison in El Salvador. The White House didn’t follow that order.
The U.S. Supreme Court also got involved earlier this month, pausing the Trump administration’s planned deportation of immigrants subject to the Alien Enemies Act.
The ACLU is now asking a judge to force the administration to return more than 130 people still held in El Salvador after deportation.
On Tuesday, the president didn’t stop at immigrants from Venezuela: “They come in from Africa. The Congo, they’ve emptied out their prisons into our country. But they come from Africa, Asia, South America. They come from all over bad parts of Europe.”
The two men charged in the Burien case remained in King County custody Wednesday with bail set at $1 million, as they await trial on attempted murder, kidnapping and robbery charges.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The House Government Oversight Committee questioned Auditor Rob Sand Wednesday about his office’s work on the misallocation of $27.5 million in court debt funds caused by coding errors.
The committee had brought Iowa Judicial Branch and State Court Administration officials in a meeting earlier in April to learn more about the programming issue that caused seven state funds to be underfunded between fiscal years 2021 and 2024. During that period, money that should have gone to those funds was erroneously sent to the state’s general fund and two other funds, but remained with the state government.
The errors were introduced when legislation passed in 2020 and 2021 made changes to the state’s court debt collection and distribution systems. The state auditor’s office was first alerted of financial irregularities by the Iowa Department of Transportation in 2022, but did not release an audit on the subject until December 2024.
House Speaker Pat Grassley and Iowa Department of Management Director Kraig Paulsen have criticized Sand for not taking action sooner — and for the issue not being mentioned in audits of the judicial branch for fiscal years 2021 and 2022. But Sand, the sole Democrat to hold statewide elected office in Iowa, told the committee Tuesday that an audit did not take place on a quicker timeframe because the issue was identified as a coding error, which is not a subject his office has employees to address.
“I don’t think that it was inappropriate for the Reynolds administration and the judicial branch — both of which knew about this issue before the auditor’s office — I don’t think it was inappropriate that they took steps to address the issue together before informing the auditor’s office,” Sand said. “That’s because, fundamentally, this was not an audit issue.”
After the coding error was identified, the judicial branch contracted with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) to review and make recommendations on how to address the misallocations and legal issues caused by the programming error. In a December 2024 statement, State Court Administrator Robert Gast said the judicial branch corrected the coding errors in the case management system as of Nov. 22.
Some GOP lawmakers on the committee criticized the auditor’s office not being more involved in the process of correcting and identifying the misallocated court debts. Rep. Judd Lawler, R-Oxford, said “the auditor’s office allowed the problem that has presented itself in 2022 to be farmed out to a third party that has no responsibility to Iowa taxpayers,” referencing the judicial branch’s work with NCSC.
Sand disputed this characterization, saying the auditor’s office has “no capacity to tell the judicial branch that they cannot hire an outside expert,” but that lawmakers have the ability to limit that ability or to appropriate funds for the auditor’s office to hire a coding expert if they believe these are the correct steps to prevent similar, future problems from arising.
The auditor also said the way the judicial branch approached the issue was not necessarily a sign of wrongdoing or abuse.
“Let me put it this way: it’s not uncommon for entities to dig in an issue and answer some questions first before they notify us,” Sand said. “Now do I wish that everybody told us right away on day one? That would be great. Immediate notification be great. The trick of that would then become, how many times do we get notified about something and then it turns out to be an issue that actually has a very similar answer, that we don’t need to be dialed in on?”
However, some legislators argued the state auditor’s office should have been more involved — and aware of the issue earlier — because it involved the misallocation of state funding. According to the auditor’s report, the error caused an under-allocation of $10.4 million for the Road Use Tax Fund and $7.2 million for the Victim Compensation Fund.
While there were audits of these funds that could have spotted the discrepancies, Sand said the amount of money misallocated was a small proportion of overall funding — in the case of the Road Use Tax Fund, a 0.13% variance from typical spending. He also said that because this money, though sent to the wrong accounts, stayed within the state, it was not identified in “high-risk areas” for consideration during audits.
He compared the misallocation to a situation where a bank incorrectly puts a person’s money in their checking account instead of their savings account, emphasizing the money still remains with the person — or in this case, with the state.
“Your high-risk areas aren’t going to be your internal transfers, because if you mess it up — again, it’s your money in your savings account versus your money in your checking account — you still have the money,” Sand said. “You’re also going to look at places you’re going to flag, large transactions or new areas of review, are typically something that you want to add scrutiny to. But when you’re talking about 0.13% variance in internal transfer, even if you realize that you had an issue there, you probably have bigger fish to fry.”
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, released a statement after the committee meeting criticizing Sand’s comments, saying the auditor “continued to downplay the significance” of the court debt misallocations.
“This misallocation has had significant consequences,” Thomson said in a statement. “Victims of crime have been denied timely compensation owed to them, infrastructure projects such as bridge repairs and road improvements have been delayed, and community safety programs have been underfunded.”
Criticisms by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird in October 2024 tied the auditor’s office not catching the coding issue to crime victims not being able to access services and support through the Victim Compensation Fund.
“No domestic violence victim should have to stay with their abuser because they cannot afford to leave,” Bird said in the statement. “The State’s self-proclaimed ‘taxpayer watchdog’ failed at the most basic job of being an auditor: conducting an audit. Crime victims should not have to worry about whether victim services will be there when they need them.”
Sand had argued in the meeting that he was not mischaracterizing the importance of the issue, but stating that the funding did not result in the impacted government accounts like the Victim Compensation Fund running out of money — or denying Iowans services because of the underfunding. The auditor’s report found this fund’s lowest balance from FY 2021 to 2024 was just under $2.7 million, and that the other impacted funds also did not run out of funds during this period.
“There wasn’t anybody at this table, but there are people in the state of Iowa who have asserted that because of the misallocation of judicial branch services weren’t provided,” Sand said. “This statement shows that that’s not true.”
Several Republicans on the committee also asked for “verifiable” and “traceable” information, which Sand said was information provided in the audit, but added lawmakers can make further formal requests for information on transactions.
The focus on Sand in the government oversight committee meeting comes as the auditor is expected to run as a Democratic candidate for governor in the 2026 general election. Some of the Republicans who have made statements criticizing Sand over the court debt misallocation issue, like Bird and Speaker Grassley, have also indicated they are considering a gubernatorial run after Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will not seek reelection in 2026.

The Department launched its new personal financial disclosure system on March 14, 2025, and has faced strong criticism since its launch from reporters, campaigns and transparency advocates. 
Neil Thanedar, executive director of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, criticized the system in a social media post earlier this month saying the new portal provides less information to the public than the previous portal, making it harder for the nonprofit’s investigators to do their jobs monitoring political spending in the state.
An investigation from Bridge Michigan in March found that the upgraded system — produced through a $9.3 million contract with Texas-based Tyler Technologies — provides less information to the public than the previous system. The investigation noted lobbyist registrations no longer listed clients, and expenses could not be easily viewed, while access to the state’s prior system was locked behind a login screen. 
Hall criticized Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is running for governor as a Democrat, saying she should “get off the campaign trail and fix her website.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He also called the system “a $9 million boondoggle,” telling reporters his House Oversight Committee should investigate what happened with that funding. 
“I mean, you spent $9 million and it’s worse,” he said.
The House Oversight Committee has authorized a subpoena against the Department of State following five months of requests from Election Integrity Committee Chair Rachelle Smit (R-Martin) for materials used to train election workers. Smit maintains the materials she requested are basic materials provided to election clerks, while members of the Department of State have warned that disclosing these materials unredacted could carry consequences for the state’s election security. 
“The House Oversight Committee, after rejecting the department’s multiple attempts to provide the requested materials in a way that protects the security of our election system, instead voted to issue an unnecessary subpoena for this sensitive information,” Angela Benander, Benson’s chief communications officer said in a statement.

“This includes materials that show active screens of the Qualified Voter File; specific information that could be used to compromise the technology used by local election officials; specific procedures for securing voting equipment, ballots, and other election-related materials; information that could be used to gain improper access to secure communication channels used to report security risks; specific locations of election administrator training and templates for official election notices,” Benander said.
Hall compared the Department’s response to the Department of Technology, Management and Budget’s decision to deny a public records request from the Detroit News on the occupancy levels in state office buildings.
“This is the same thing that they said about the election manuals. So Benson, ‘I can’t give you the election manuals because of security reasons.’ Now, Whitmer administration, ‘The state workers, where are they working? We can’t give that to you for security reasons,’” Hall said. 
“Are they coming in the office or not? We’re going to find out, and we are going to bring the government workers back to the office. We’re just going to do it. We’re going to force them to do it in the state budget. And we’re going to get the information, even if we had to subpoena them,” Hall said. 
Benander told the Michigan Advance in an email that the state’s contract with its previous system, MERTS, expires this year, meaning the department needed to create a new system and migrate and convert massive amounts of old data, putting the department behind schedule.
Those delays dramatically impacted the department’s ability to conduct pre-launch data testing, Benander said, noting that they’d been finding errors and problems with the system’s performance as a result.
“We understand this is a problem. We are working to fix it as quickly as possible but have had to prioritize the parts of the system that allow filers to meet their legal requirements by the filing deadline. Once the project is complete, this system will be much more transparent and accessible than the old system and the temporary issues we’re experiencing now will be fully resolved,” Benander said.
“Our priority right now is to fix the problems and get the new MiTN system fully up and running over the next several weeks,” She said. 
Debates over road funding continue as Senate Dems offer education proposal
Alongside his criticisms of Benson, Hall took shots at Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), who has said she has been working to meet with Hall, without success. 
“That’s just false. They’re not making any effort to have meetings with me,” Hall said.
However, emails reviewed by the Michigan Advance show Brinks’ staff made multiple attempts to schedule a weekly meeting with Hall, without success.

Hall further argued Democrats had created a false narrative of funding roads versus funding education, with House Republicans passing their road funding plan in March and Senate Democrats putting forth their School Aid Budget proposal on Tuesday.
House Republicans’ plan removes the state’s 6% sales tax on gasoline and instead increases the motor fuel tax by 20 cents, designating that funding for road upkeep. However, the gas tax contributes more than $700 million a year to the state’s School Aid Fund, which Hall has suggested could be replaced with money from the state’s general fund, which House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri said was “robbing Peter to pay Paul.”
Hall emphasized that education was among House Republicans’ funding priorities, alongside roads and public safety, challenging Brinks to put forth her own road funding plan.
“The people of Michigan don’t care if Winnie Brinks and I like each other. If she has solutions on roads, put them up for a vote, and then we’ll negotiate. Simple as that. Governor Whitmer is trying to do that, and if she can’t do it, then at least empower Governor Whitmer, because what Governor Whitmer is doing is much more effective than what Winnie Brinks is doing,” Hall said. 
Brinks spokesperson Rosie Jones directed the Michigan Advance to the majority leader’s comments in a Wednesday report from Crain’s Detroit Business, where she questioned if Hall was serious about coming to an agreement on roads and said Hall should stop insulting Senate Democrats.
While Senate Democrats are considering ideas from both Hall’s proposal — which largely consists of funding from eliminating or halting economic development spending — and Whitmer’s proposal — which would draw more than half of its funding from a tax on large corporations and big tech companies — Brinks told Crain’s she did not intend to pass a deal without making a deal first, emphasizing that any road funding plan should move alongside the state budget.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1221-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 20:04:12.706267

(Stock photo by Warodom Changyencham/Getty Images)Iowa’s public universities may see a reduction in their general state funding for the upcoming fiscal year, according to legislation proposed by House Republicans, but the chair of the bill’s subcommittee said savings from eliminated programs and positions and funding in other areas will more than make up for it.
The House Education Appropriations Subcommittee met Wednesday to discuss House Study Bill 337, which would allocate more than $1 billion in state dollars to the Iowa Department of Education, Iowa Board of Regents and its universities, community colleges, departments for the blind and deaf and more.
Rep. Austin Harris, R-Moulton, chaired the subcommittee meeting and said lawmakers will continue to work on the budget, but he is pleased with its current form.
“I’m very proud of the budget that the House Republicans have put forward,” Harris said. “I think it’s in line with our principles of being fiscally responsible and restrained and making sure that we have good budget practices, also while we’re making investments across the entire state.”

Each of Iowa’s public universities would see less general university funding from the state than what they requested, according to the bill, and less than what is proposed in the Iowa Senate’s version of education appropriation legislation.
The University of Iowa would receive more than $222.6 million in general university funding, according to the legislation, with Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa set to receive almost $177.7 million and just over $101.4 million, respectively. Both the UI and ISU requested flat funding for fiscal year 2026, and UNI asked for an increase of $2.5 million.
Rep. Monica Kurth, D-Davenport, said it’s “very concerning” to see general funding for universities decrease when costs have kept rising. Both the UI and ISU would see a decrease of $800,000 under the bill, she said, and UNI would receive nearly $500,000 less in general funding.
“Those are our higher education institutions and to not increase their funding, to at least take into account cost of living adjustment, I think is very concerning,” Kurth said.
State universities saved more than $2 million by eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs and positions across their campuses, Harris said, and when looking at specific university programs funded in the bill, total appropriations have actually increased.
Included in the House bill is a section funding the proposed UI center for intellectual freedom with a $1.5 million appropriation, pending Gov. Kim Reynolds’s signature on legislation establishing the center. Other university funding Harris noted included $4 million to the UI for rural maternal and mental health professional programs, $1 million for UI cancer research, a combined $4 million for ISU extension offices, agricultural and veterinary programs and $3 million to UNI for an in-state tuition program for students from bordering states.
Both ISU and UNI would see more than $3 million in total state allocations under the bill, Harris said, and the UI would receive an increase of around $5.6 million.
Other departments and organizations seeing funding increases include the Department for the Blind, Iowa School for the Deaf, Iowa PBS and loan and incentive programs.
Community colleges would receive almost $243.9 million under the House legislation, about $8 million more than the Senate bill proposes. Lawmakers voiced their support for this change, but Rep. Elinor Levin, D-Iowa City, said she was concerned with the many “status quo line items,” or budget items that have remained unchanged from last year, in the bill.
Despite all of the talk about the importance of early literacy, Levin said there is no increased funding for initiatives to help with this problem in the bill, nor are there increases for postsecondary summer classes for high school students or statewide student assessments.
The bill will move to the House Appropriations Committee after a 5-2 vote.
“We obviously know how the process here works, and moving forward, we’re going to continue to work on the budget to hopefully get us out of here at a decent time,” Harris said.

A 24-year-old University of Delaware graduate student was killed and another seriously injured after a stolen U-Haul van driven by a man crashed on East Main Street Tuesday afternoon.
Police announced Wednesday afternoon that Gordon Turner, 22, of New Castle, was arrested following the incident, which began shortly before 4:30 p.m. on April 29.
Officers had been searching for a U-Haul van reported as an unauthorized vehicle that was due back in March.
RELATED: 1 dead, several injured after U-Haul crashes into pedestrians in Newark
The van was found unoccupied in a shopping center on the 200 block of East Main Street.
When Turner and a passenger returned to the vehicle, police moved in.
Turner reportedly fled by driving over a curb, striking a police cruiser, and speeding onto East Main Street. Officers did not pursue the van.
Moments later, Turner lost control of the vehicle near Haines Street, striking two pedestrians on the sidewalk. One of the victims was pronounced dead at the scene.
The second victim, also a 24-year-old graduate student, was hospitalized in serious condition but is now stable.
The crash triggered a chain reaction involving several parked vehicles and additional injuries.
A third pedestrian was hurt when a parked vehicle, struck during the crash, was pushed into them.
Turner was taken to a hospital, then released into police custody.
A passenger in the van was also detained but has not been charged. A search of the van revealed a handgun and marijuana exceeding the legal possession limit.
Turner faces multiple charges, including two counts of second-degree murder, first-degree assault, and fleeing police.
He is also wanted by authorities in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. After arraignment, he was held at Howard R. Young Correctional Institution on $305,500 cash bond.
East Main Street remained closed for about five hours as investigators examined the scene with assistance from multiple agencies.
Police are asking anyone with video footage of the crash or additional information to contact Cpl. Jon Lee at (302) 366-7100 ext. 3462 or jlee@newark.de.us. Anonymous tips can be submitted through the department’s tip line.
Statement from University of Delaware leadership on U-Haul death
“Dear UD Community,
Since last evening’s crash on Main Street that took the life of a University of Delaware graduate student (whose identity is being withheld at this time) and injured several others, we have been struggling to cope with the pain of this senseless tragedy. Throughout the UD community, we are all feeling the deep ache of loss, and we will continue to work through our grief together.
Today, Newark Police announced an arrest in connection with the crash, reiterating that there is no ongoing threat to the community.
Main Street is where we eat, shop and share our lives with our friends, families and classmates. Because it is part of the state’s roadway systems, we have been working with local and state officials this year, including our partners at Delaware Department of Transportation, to address traffic safety on and around Main Street. In the wake of this tragedy, we will reinforce and accelerate those efforts. We recognize there isn’t a simple solution, particularly when these tragedies involve actions taken by individuals that may not be stopped by changes to roadways or infrastructure. However, this incident underscores that our collective efforts must take on renewed urgency.
University leaders joined Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings and Newark Mayor Travis McDermott today for a press conference, at which we expressed our shared commitment to enhanced safety along Main Street. The University has pledged to continue these discussions through meetings with the offices of AG Jennings and Mayor McDermott, in addition to DelDOT, in the near future. The University remains committed to advancing meaningful solutions, while the University’s Division of Student Life and Graduate College are connecting with students about effective advocacy, civic engagement and partnerships in order to support these efforts.
We are also aware that members of the UD community may have witnessed the crash and its aftermath or have close relationships with the victims. We encourage everyone to become familiar with and use, as needed, the available University counseling and support resources that were shared in Tuesday evening’s message to the UD community. Counseling services are available at Warner Hall and through TimelyCare anytime, 24/7. Students with physical injuries or medical concerns relating to the incident can contact Student Health Services at 302-831-2226, Option 0, or visit Laurel Hall to meet with triage nurses available until 5 p.m. After hours, students can contact the Highmark Nurse line at 888-258-3428 or visit local urgent care centers (Newark Urgent Care at 324 E. Main Street, or ChristianaCare GoHealth at 550 S. College Avenue, Suite 115).
During this difficult time in our community, we all need to continue supporting and standing by one another as we move forward together.
Sincerely,
Dennis Assanis, President

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)A political fund associated with SpaceX — the company founded by world’s richest man Elon Musk — has donated thousands of dollars to Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who announced her campaign for U.S. Senate this week.
The Space Exploration Technologies Corps. PAC is a corporate political action committee that has donated generously to Republican and Democratic members of Congress across the country, including U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum and Minnesota Republicans, in addition to Craig.
The SpaceX PAC hasn’t received donations from Elon Musk, though he is the company CEO. The SpaceX PAC’s treasurer is the treasury director for SpaceX, and the PAC email address is that of a company lobbyist.
In 2024, Craig’s campaign for U.S. House received $10,000 from the SpaceX PAC, while Craig’s leadership PAC received a $2,500 donation.
Craig has been a sharp critic of Musk.
“Trump and Musk are burning our government down,” Craig said in announcing her Senate run.
In a statement to the Reformer, Craig’s Senate campaign said she has donated the SpaceX donations to Every Third Saturday, a veterans organization.
“This donation will help support those on the frontlines of Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s reckless cuts to the VA, part of the dangerous Trump-Musk agenda that Rep. Craig has been fighting tooth and nail since day one of this administration,” a campaign spokesperson said.
Musk, who’s also a close advisor to Trump, has used DOGE to drastically cut and reshape the federal government and the services it provides.
Craig has criticized Musk’s access to Americans’ confidential information, and at a Lakeville town hall earlier this month, Craig said Musk is cutting crucial services for Minnesotans.
“With the help of unelected billionaire Elon Musk, they’ve taken a sledgehammer to our federal agencies, laying off veterans, public health employees, FSA loan officers — jeopardizing the critical services Minnesotans rely on,” Craig said.
Craig, who has represented the 2nd Congressional District since 2019, will battle Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and former Senate Minority Leader Melisa López Franzen in what is expected to be a grueling Democratic primary.
Among Minnesota’s congressional delegation, McCollum has received the most campaign donations from the SpaceX PAC — over $30,000 since 2018.

When Democrats controlled Congress, McCollum held an influential position as chair of the defense subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, giving her a major hand in hundreds of billions of dollars in Pentagon spending. SpaceX, a major defense contractor, received $3.8 billion in federal contracts in 2024, according to The New York Times.
In a statement to the Reformer, McCollum’s campaign said the SpaceX PAC money was used to help elected Democrats.
“In the 2022 and 2024 congressional election cycles, Congresswoman McCollum’s leadership PAC and re-election campaign contributed over $1 million to Democratic candidates for Congress and Democratic Party organizations. Every dollar donated by SpaceX employees was deployed to help elect Democrats in Minnesota and across the country.”
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar in 2017 and 2018 received $2,000 from the SpaceX PAC.
Since 2018, Democrats in Minnesota’s congressional delegation have received more support from the SpaceX PAC compared to Republicans.
Republican Rep. Brad Finstad received $5,000 in 2024, while GOP Reps. Pete Stauber and Tom Emmer each received a $2,500 donation.
Overall, however, Musk-related entities have turned sharply right, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaigns for Trump and other Republicans. Most recently, Musk dumped about $22 million for a Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, though his preferred candidate lost handily.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Craig.jpeg,,,2025-04-30 20:04:12.706267

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s proposed budget is expected to eliminate Head Start, the federal program that provides free or low-cost child care to low-income families.
Head Start serves 12,000 children in Minnesota, mostly in rural areas, said Kraig Gratke, executive director of the Minnesota Head Start Association. Republicans and Democrats alike have supported Head Start. In 2024, Minnesota U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber and dozens of his Republican colleagues wrote a letter to congressional budget leaders urging them to prioritize funding for Head Start. 
Head Start is funded through Sept. 30, but would expire Oct. 1 if Trump’s proposed budget is passed. 
“It’s unconscionable to me to think about taking away critical supports that help families raise their children,” said U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison, D-Minn., at a press conference denouncing the proposed cuts.
Minnesota is facing a crisis of child care availability and affordability; the state has some of the highest child care costs in the nation. 
Gratke said Minnesota Head Start is already feeling the impact of cuts. The Department of Health and Human Services closed six regional offices, including one in Chicago, which was Minnesota’s point of contact for Head Start and other federal programs. In early April, many Head Start staffers were laid off. 
Families that qualify for Head Start also qualify for the similar state Child Care Assistance Program, or CCAP — so Head Start saves the state around $65 million per year by using federal resources to serve families who would otherwise rely on state assistance, Gratke said. 
Head Start employs 3,200 people in Minnesota. Eight tribal nations have Head Start centers. 
“These are very hard pills to swallow when we’re already dealing with a lot of economic issues and folks are struggling,” Gratke said. Trump is expected to release his full budget proposal as soon as next week.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2198395626-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 19:05:35.885634

Federal investigation determined that Andrew Archuleta accepted gifts and used government resources in ways that conflict with ethics policies.
The post BLM Wyoming director on leave after probe finds ethics violations appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s Bureau of Land Management state director has been placed on administrative leave after a federal investigation found he violated ethics regulations. 
Andrew Archuleta accepted a gift of dinner and drinks, misused his assistant’s time when he asked her to make travel arrangements for his girlfriend and drove his girlfriend to and from Buffalo in a government vehicle — all in violation of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, according to a February investigation summary from the Office of Inspector General. 
Archuleta was placed on leave in April, BLM Wyoming Deputy State Director for Communications Brad Purdy confirmed Wednesday. Kris Kirby has been named acting state director, Purdy said. 
Archuleta was selected to helm the state’s BLM office in January 2022. In the position, he has overseen the management of 17.5 million surface acres of public lands and more than 40 million acres of federal sub-surface mineral lands. He directed an office with more than 600 permanent staff and 150 seasonal employees who help manage everything from energy development and livestock grazing to campgrounds, multi-use trails, outdoor recreation spots and wild horses.

He occupied the spot during a time of tumult and national attention. The 2023 release of the draft Rock Spring Field Office Resource Management Plan sparked furor and heated debate over how to manage some 3.6 million acres of public lands in southwestern Wyoming. The plan spurred state intervention, drew thousands of comments and triggered fierce criticism of the federal government by elected officials and others.
Gifts, travel, rental cars
The Office of Inspector General investigated allegations that Archuleta may have violated the ethical conduct standards when he “accepted a gift of dinner and drinks at a Cheyenne, Wyoming, steakhouse from the owner of a commercial sign manufacturing company,” according to the investigation summary. 
Investigators found that he was in violation in that matter, according to the summary. They also determined Archuleta misused his subordinate’s time when he asked his assistant to make air travel arrangements on the clock for his girlfriend to accompany him on official travel, the summary states. 
“In addition, we determined that Archuleta misused a Government rental vehicle in violation of DOI policy when he allowed his girlfriend to drive the rental vehicle and that he violated the Federal Travel Regulation when he used the Government rental car for personal purposes,” the summary continues.

Finally, investigators found Archuleta violated policy when he drove his girlfriend to and from Buffalo in a government vehicle “because she was neither a Federal employee nor conducting official Government business there.” 
Background 
Archuleta’s career in federal service stretches back three decades, according to a BLM press release that announced his 2022 selection. His former assignments include BLM Colorado’s Northwest District manager and district manager for BLM’s California Desert District. He has also worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service.
“His understanding of rural communities and the challenges they face coupled with the expertise he has developed will continue to benefit the BLM and the Wyoming communities and constituencies we serve,” former BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning said in the 2022 announcement.
Archuleta, a Colorado native, earned both a bachelor’s degree in wildlife biology and a master’s degree in wildlife toxicology from Colorado State University. He is an avid outdoorsman, according to the BLM. 
Purdy could not comment on further action or future steps regarding Archuleta’s position. 
WyoFile was unable to contact Archuleta on Wednesday for comment.

The House Education Policy Committee adopted an amendment that would require the program to be taught in middle school, instead of high school. Smitherman said the State Superintendent Eric Mackey suggested the change. 
“Dr. Mackey came over and talked to me. He said we need to start this in middle school,” Smitherman said. 
A message seeking comment from Mackey was sent Wednesday afternoon.
Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, supported the legislation and highlighted the importance of conflict resolution.
“I think problem solving is important, and I agree with Dr. Mackey on the timing in middle school,” she said.
The course must include lessons on: “responsible decision-making; the causes and effects of school violence and harassment, cultural diversity, and nonviolent methods for resolving conflict, including peer mediation; the consequences of violent behavior; the causes of violent reactions to conflict; nonviolent conflict resolution techniques; the relationship between drugs, alcohol, and violence; the implementation of voluntary peer mediation programs and the integration of conflict resolution models in classrooms.”
Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, also supported the legislation but was worried about the additional stress a new class would put on teachers.
“We do pile too much on the teachers, continuing things that we try to do in the total development of the child, not just academics,” Baker said. 
Smitherman said it is up to the state Board of Education to decide how often, when and how the course will be taught.
The bill moves to the full House for consideration. There are four days left in the 2025 legislative session.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A measure that would prevent development in state parks was passed unanimously in the Florida Senate on Wednesday, 37-0. However, the measure now must go back to the House for one more vote before it can arrive on Gov. DeSantis’ desk to be signed into law.
The State Park Preservation Act (HB 209) was filed last year by Southeast Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell following a statewide public backlash to the Department of Environmental Protection’s “Great Outdoor Initiative.”
That plan called for building lodges, golf courses, pickleball courts, and disc golf courses in nine state parks.
“This is democracy at work,” Harrell said before the Senate passed the measure.
“This was really a grassroots endeavor that came up and the participation of so many people across the aisle, every socioeconomic group, every group that you could talk to, this was the issue of the summer. I can tell you that all the demonstrations out in the hot August sun in Florida to get out there and do that to let people know that our parks are the core of who we are.”
The Florida House unanimously passed its version of the bill last week, but its Senate companion (SB 80) had not been scheduled for a vote until Wednesday, drawing concern from environmentalists that the measure wouldn’t be addressed before the legislative session was scheduled to end later this week.
(The session is expected to go beyond this week, however, with the two chambers at odds over the state budget).
Those concerns increased earlier this week when Miami-Dade Republican Sen. Alexis Calatayud added an amendment that the Sierra Club claimed in a press release was “an obvious attempt to run out the clock.”
However, Harrell gladly accepted Calatayud’s amendment on Wednesday, which included language prohibiting construction of specified sporting facilities and public lodging in state parks — listing  golf courses, tennis courts, pickleball courts, ball fields, or other sporting facilities that “may not be constructed within the boundaries of state parks.”
But her amendment also says that the state can continue to maintain or repair of “any such sporting facilities, or other facilities, existing with a state park.”
The bill requires the DEP to  report to the governor and Legislature regarding the status and operation of state parks. Additionally, the bill revises notice requirements for public meetings.
It requires individual land management plans with parcels within a state park to be developed with the input of an advisory committee. It also says that the Division of State Lands shall make available to the public an electronic copy of each land management plan at least 30 days before the public hearing required for parcels that exceed 160 acres in size and for parcels located within a state park.
Panhandle Republican Sen. Don Gaetz asked Harrell whether she could assure him that there is no “weasel word” in the bill that would “allow any kind of commercialization of our state parks now or in the future, or in any land that would be required contiguous to our state parks?”

Glenn Youngkin’s top political strategist and head of the Spirit of Virginia PAC, broke his silence Wednesday evening, rejecting accusations that he tried to pressure GOP lieutenant governor nominee John Reid out of the race and declaring that “facts matter.”
Youngkin’s political adviser under fire as extortion allegations rock Virginia GOP

Less than two hours before Reid was set to appear solo at a GOP rally in Henrico County after Youngkin canceled the event originally scheduled for the entire statewide Republican slate, Moran took to social media to push back on what he called “unfounded” claims and released a sworn affidavit along with a pointed legal letter from his attorney.
“I’ve known John Reid for years and consider him a friend,” Moran wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Over the last nine days, I was actively supporting and assisting John as the Lt. Governor nominee of the Republican Party. Let me be clear, facts matter, and they will demonstrate the accusations against me are unfounded.”
Moran also posted a letter from his attorney, George Terwilliger III, addressed to Reid’s campaign. In it, Terwilliger disputed Reid’s version of events, suggesting Reid had been misled. 
“From that sequence, I am going to assume, until it is demonstrated otherwise, that you were not provided sufficiently reliable information,” Terwilliger wrote, adding that “erroneous conclusions… manifested as the unsupported accusations against Mr. Moran.”
The lawyer said Moran took “the extraordinary step” of signing an affidavit to affirm “accurate fundamental facts” and show that the allegations “are unfounded.” Terrwilliger urged Reid to retract his claims and warned of potential legal consequences if the “unfounded and untoward accusations” continue, saying “such demands were made of Mr. Moran,” and all related materials should be preserved.
“To be clear, Mr. Moran strongly denies that he has defamed Mr. Reid in any manner whatsoever,” Terrwilliger wrote. “The facts, evidence, and witnesses would demonstrate that Mr. Moran never attempted to extort, coerce, or pressure Mr. Reid… but rather as a seasoned professional endeavored to provide sound advice regarding the viability of Mr. Reid’s candidacy to someone he counted as a friend.”
Still, Terwilliger signaled a willingness to cool tensions, asking the Reid campaign if they were open to “scheduling a call where we might further discuss the matter.”
The public response marks a new phase in a feud that has roiled Virginia Republicans since last week — pitting the governor’s inner circle against the party’s first openly gay statewide nominee in a clash that’s turned deeply personal and politically damaging.
In deepening Va. GOP crisis, Reid accuses Youngkin PAC of extortion. Is a legal battle ahead?

Reid, a conservative radio host and longtime personality on WRVA, escalated the firestorm Sunday, which began two days earlier when The Richmonder reported that Youngkin had called the radio host and asked him to end his campaign. 
In a video posted on X, Reid alleged that “representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out.” 
He didn’t name Moran in the video, but on Monday his campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter directly accusing Moran of defamation and “actual malice.”
The letter claims Moran told news outlets Reid was behind a sexually explicit Tumblr account — a charge Reid’s team denies. “While this account shared a common username with our client’s Instagram, he is not and never has been associated with the account,” the letter stated. It also accuses Moran of telling Reid that “him getting out of the race is the only way it stops.”
Moran, 36, heads the governor’s Spirit of Virginia PAC and serves as Youngkin’s unpaid policy director. His central role in the campaign operation has drawn backlash from Republicans  across the state, with some urging Youngkin to cut ties amid the controversy.
“Firing Matt really is the only appropriate thing for Governor Youngkin to do,” Casey Flores, founder of the Richmond chapter of Log Cabin Republicans, a national LGBTQ+ GOP group, told The Mercury on Tuesday.
Even some party stalwarts have raised alarms about how the allegations have been handled. 
John Reid imbroglio tests gender, sexuality and privacy standards in Virginia politics

Former Republican Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling said the core question — whether Reid had any real connection to the Tumblr account — “remains unresolved.” 
And Rick Buchanan, chair of the 5th District GOP committee, said Youngkin made a mistake by listening to Moran “without knowing the facts.”
Others have raised concerns about Moran’s dual roles. Loudoun County GOP Chair Scott Pio called his arrangement — being on leave from two consulting firms while advising Youngkin — a conflict of interest. 
“Since Matt doesn’t have a statewide client, he decides to throw this bomb,” Pio said. “Youngkin being a businessman, he should know when to hire and fire quickly.”
Calls are also growing for internal accountability. In a letter to GOP Chairman Mark Peake, Buchanan and 6th District Chair John Massoud urged the party’s executive committee to privately review any images Moran may have shown the governor. They said the accusations were serious, but “the evidence behind the allegations … have not been forthcoming.”
Wednesday’s previously scheduled GOP “unity” rally was abruptly canceled in the wake of the controversy. Reid has vowed to continue campaigning and appeared at the Henrico event without other party leaders. 
The rally instead became a backdrop to Moran’s digital counterattack — one that may escalate the conflict even further, despite his lawyer’s call to “de-escalate.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The carton of milk you purchase from the local grocery store may soon be made in Little Rock. 
That’s because Elopak, a Norwegian packaging company that specializes in producing cartons for milk, juice, and other liquid food products, had the grand opening for its first carton production plant in the United States on Wednesday. The celebration included remarks by Elopak’s CEO, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. and a pre-recorded video of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Elopak executives emphasized the company’s commitment to sustainability, noting that one of their key strategic goals is to take advantage of a global souring on plastic to grow the business.
“This plant — and this is why this is such a momentous, historic event for us — is a key milestone in our strategy,” Elopak CEO Thomas Körmendi said. “It gives us the possibility to offer more customers, more consumers, sustainable packaging solutions with the latest development in mind for many, many years to come.”
The new facility, which was built in less than 12 months on swampland near the Port of Little Rock, will employ around 100 people, company officials said.
Körmendi gave remarks to a standing-room-only crowd — some from as far as Japan — at the facility’s grand opening. Körmendi touted the business he leads as the largest liquid carton company in the world while stating that Little Rock “fits perfectly” into Elopak’s larger global strategy.
Scott said that it was not lost on him that a large global company was coming into one of the smallest U.S. states, crediting the work of the Little Rock Port Authority and the Little Rock Board of Directors for their recruitment efforts.
“We all are working every day with a lot of grit and grind to make sure that we can land a company like you, and so as you’re having this repackaging tomorrow across this world, we’re privileged, we’re grateful that you’ve decided to come to Little Rock,” Scott said.
Meanwhile, Sanders, in pre-recorded remarks, held up signature policy moves by her administration as the reason for job creation and growth in the state.
“Arkansas beat out several other states for this project, showing that cutting taxes, investing in education and building up our workforce is the key to bringing new companies to our state,” Sanders said. “Thank you to all Elopak’s leadership for your investment, in not only the United States, but in the Natural State.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Clint O’Neal, executive director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, emphasized tax cuts as well, saying that even more could be on the horizon.
“We’ve had many great successes over this past legislative session,” O’Neal said. “I would call it the best economic development session in the last couple of decades.” 
“We’re committed to making this place a great business environment,” he added. “We don’t want companies to worry about, ‘Is this a state that’s getting ready to increase my taxes?’ You can be confident in Arkansas that we have reduced taxes, and if anything, this is a state that’s going to continue to reduce taxes to continue to create an environment that you can find success in.”
Körmendi said in an interview that Little Rock had been “very attractive” to the company because it checked off many of the boxes Elopak had when evaluating where they would put the U.S. plant. 
“Our customers will source their packaging material from plants that are close by, which is really also why we need one in the U.S.,” he said.
Körmendi declined to provide estimates for how much Elopak would produce at the Little Rock facility in the coming months, but Elopak Americas President Lionel Ettedgui said in an interview that the capacity of the new Little Rock facility’s first production line sold out quickly. The company plans to open a second line within the coming year.
“We have also initiated and will be inaugurating the next line next year, the first half of next year,” Körmendi said. “We are absolutely committed to filling up the factory.”
Elopak exists in a low-competition industry, Ettedgui added, making the investment in U.S. operations low-risk with high return.
“It’s a very specific market,” Ettedgui said. “When joining Elopak, I did my research and I found that sustainability, innovation were part of their DNA, in an industry where you don’t see that many innovations…The company walks the talk.” 
Körmendi did not appear concerned about the uncertain tariff situation the U.S. finds itself in when asked about whether the moves by President Donald Trump could affect production at the facility. Their facilities in Canada and Mexico are covered under free trade agreements, giving them more flexibility, he said.
“We have more than 90% of the material we use — 93%, I think, actually, comes from the U.S.,” Körmendi said.
“Low levels” of production have already started at the plant, Körmendi said.

The free-to-attend festival, the first of a three-year residency in Jackson, will bring around 300 artists, musicians, dancers and storytellers together for a weekend celebrating traditions such as blues, bluegrass and go-go music.

“This moment is especially thrilling because it represents not just a lineup of remarkable performers but the beginning of something truly transformative for our city, a cultural legacy in the making,” said Jackson’s first lady Ebony Lumumba, chair of the executive committee for the National Folk Festival Jackson.
“For the next three years, Jackson will be home to one of the oldest and most celebrated cultural festivals in the nation, and that means that we are planting artistic and economic seeds that will blossom into something extraordinary for our residents, our artists, our young people and visitors from all over the world,” she said.
The National Folk Festival was created in 1934 and has traveled nationwide. With an anticipated 60,000 to 80,000 visitors in its first year, the event is expected to grow to welcome more than 150,000 people to the Capital City. The festival will stimulate economic growth in Jackson, with other host cities seeing $15 million to $30 million dollars of long-term annual impact by the end of its third year, said Blaine Waide, executive director of the National Council for the Traditional Arts. 
On Wednesday, Waide and other key partners in the festival announced the first performers added to the lineup. Artists include sacred steel guitar band The Campbell Brothers, go-go group E.U. featuring Sugar Bear, and Mississippi-born, Chicago-based John Primer & The Real Deal Blues Band. Bluegrass singer Dale Ann Bradley, Irish artist Eileen Ivers, flamenco couple LOS RICOS featuring Sonia and Ismael, bomba band Plena Libre and the South Asian ensemble Riyaaz Qawwali will also perform.
Over the next coming months, more will be announced, including dancers, craftspeople and storytellers, leading to approximately 300 artists tapped to participate. Applications are open for food and market place vendors. The deadline to apply is May 19.
Thabi Moyo, local festival organizer, said that it’s not just a big weekend, but a promising opportunity for Jackson and Mississippi. Jackson was selected out of 42 cities that applied to host the festival.
“Mississippi has been at the National Folk Festival, but this is the first time that it’s come to the Deep South, but Mississippi has always been represented,” Moyo said. “That right there to me speaks to the influence of the type of music and culture, arts and culture and impact that we’ve had because it’s already out in the world and people love it.”

In addition to the National Folk Festival, Moyo has been hosting Folk After 5 at Hal and Mal’s restaurant, which will be held every first Thursday leading up the the festival. Visitors can enjoy folk music played by a live DJ, and meet with organizers and learn more about the festival. 
“I wanted to create a space that’s low stakes, that’s easy, where you can come engage with folks who are involved with making the festival happen,” Moyo said.
Waide said that Mississippi is the perfect place to host the National Folk Festival due to its cultural influence and legacy of creating history-making entertainers. 
“It’s the home of Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, Pops Staples. You’ve got country music, blues music, gospel music,” Waide said. “… American musical history would not be what it is without the state of Mississippi, so it’s an appropriate place to have this festival.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190212/National-Folk-Festival-Kickoff-10-1.jpg,,,2025-04-30 19:05:35.885634

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Lawmakers in both chambers of the Florida Legislature voted unanimously Wednesday to pass a bill addressing rising fees for condominium owners, which is one of the items that has sprouted criticism from Gov. Ron DeSantis.
With the scheduled end of the session looming mere days away, the Legislature approved a bill, HB 913, that allows condominium associations to secure credit lines and invest funds to pay for building repairs instead of immediately raising large amounts of cash from owners.
But lawmakers sponsoring the legislation acknowledged that they will likely have to continue making changes in the future in light of escalating fees following last year’s deadline for condominiums to complete studies detailing how much each needs to save to pay for roof and structural maintenance.

“This incredible bill addressing the condominium crisis we have all heard about for the last year gives a lot of financial relief,” Miami Republican Rep. Vicki Lopez said. She’s the bill’s main sponsor in the House. Fleming Island Republican Sen. Jennifer Bradley filed the Senate’s proposal.
Lawmakers passed legislation requiring those studies and milestone inspections 30 years after a building’s construction, following the 2021 collapse in Surfside of a 12-story condo that killed 98 people.
The passage comes amid DeSantis’ continued bashing of the Legislature, with emphasis on the House, over their inaction on condos. He called lawmakers to Tallahassee at the beginning of the year for a special session on immigration, condos, hurricane relief, and citizen-led constitutional amendments. The Legislature ended up only addressing immigration ahead of their scheduled session opening in March.
“We have this condo issue, that legislation that caused these crushing assessments,” DeSantis said during a Wednesday press conference about Hope Florida in Fruitland Park. “We know people need relief from that. We’ve gotta do it. The Senate’s got a great product that can do it.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
What changed and what remained?
Senators waited a week to take up the House’s proposal, with changes requiring both chambers to make concessions. For example, Bradley’s idea to allow condo associations to invest money meant for repairs is still in the bill, but the compromise limits those investments to certificates of deposit. The House’s push to allow associations to pay for repairs with credits will also require support from the majority of owners of condo units.
The legislation provides some flexibility for associations, carving out condos with only three residential stories from the building inspection requirements and letting associations pause contributions to reserve funds for repairs for up to two years after a milestone inspection, required 30 years after the buildings’ construction.
With the bill headed to the governor’s desk, DeSantis could still harbor objections to it, particularly regarding electronic voting. A quarter of condo owners could petition their association to hold an electronic vote under the bill, which DeSantis has said would incite fraud.
Still, one provision that intensified disagreement between the sponsors early made its way to the Senate floor’s discussion despite the House abandoning the idea earlier in the process. Lopez originally wanted to prohibit Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state’s property insurer of last resort, from issuing or renewing policies for condominium buildings that haven’t completed their building inspections.
“Obviously, ensuring compliance is important, but such a provision would devastate owners in an already weak condo market,” Bradley said, adding that she brought up the removed provision because other senators still raised concerns about it.
Both Lopez and Bradley received compliments from their colleagues. Senators made multiple references to constituents yelling at them over the heightened fees.
“Condo meetings are not where you wanna go with a thin skin. I assure you of that,” Bradley said.

(Austin Fisher / Source NM)The New Mexico Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday requesting all the parties involved in a wastewater disposal dispute in Tesuque submit written arguments by May 19.
The court’s decision follows an April 22 emergency petition submitted by attorneys representing nonprofit Protect Tesuque to halt a proposed permit for treated wastewater from Bishop’s Lodge hotel and 82 adjacent homes in Tesuque Village.
New Mexico Supreme Court asked to weigh in on Tesuque wastewater conflict

Protect Tesuque argued that the New Mexico Environment Department wrongly applied state environmental laws in the permitting process, and asked the state’s highest court to intervene.
In the motion, attorneys for the nonprofit argue that NMED’s permitting policies unequally enforce limitations in liquid waste laws between smaller and larger permits (more than 5,000 gallons of liquid waste per day), which they say amounts to a constitutional violation because it ignores state environmental laws.
Tom Hnasko, the attorney representing Protect Tesuque, said the court could have denied the petition without further argument.
“They obviously want to see what the Environment Department and Bishop’s Lodge have to say about the matter,” he said.
Attorneys for both Bishop’s Lodge and the New Mexico Environment Department requested the state’s justices deny the petition, and filed documents last week saying they intended to file further arguments.
“The New Mexico Environment Department remains confident in its legal position that Bishop’s Lodge’s wastewater treatment system is subject to state ground and surface water quality regulations. NMED has consistently found that the facility meets or exceeds all applicable state water quality standards. Due to ongoing litigation, we are unable to comment further at this time,” said Drew Goretzka, a spokesperson at the New Mexico Environment Department in a written statement Wednesday.
Representatives for Bishop’s Lodge or its parent company, Juniper Capital, did not respond to emailed requests for comment Wednesday afternoon. The hotel and its parent company maintain that the proposal to treat sewage is safe, noting that it installed a new wastewater treatment plant in 2024 “designed to meet or exceed all local and national water quality standards.”
The draft permit is scheduled for a May 19 hearing before the New Mexico Environment for additional testimony, which at this time, remains in place.

Starting as soon as July, cannabis retailers with a new medical-use endorsement will be able to sell medical-grade pot products to select patients enrolled in the state’s medical program.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerSince Vermont’s first recreational cannabis dispensaries opened their doors in 2022, the state’s medical marijuana program has hit the skids.As of November 2024, just over 2,700 patients were enrolled in the program, down from a high of almost 5,500 medical-card holders in 2017, according to data from Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board. And as patients have opted to simply buy cannabis products at the now-ubiquitous recreational retailers, all but two of the state’s standalone medical dispensaries have shuttered their doors.“The business model just doesn’t work anymore,” James Pepper, chair of Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board, told members of the House Committee on Human Services Wednesday. To bolster the declining program, Vermont lawmakers have moved to integrate medical and recreational cannabis sales. Last year, the legislature passed Act 166, a law that, among other measures, introduced a new medical-use endorsement for cannabis retailers. The Cannabis Control Board could begin issuing it to select dispensaries as soon as this July. Cannabis retailers with the endorsement will be able to essentially operate as medical dispensaries. That means they can sell medical-grade weed products to select patients enrolled in the state’s medical program tax-free, provide curbside pickup and increase quantity limits for sales to patients, among other things.But regulators are still ironing out the details on how to roll out the new endorsement. A large and lingering question is how to properly train and educate budtenders — the cannabis salespeople at dispensaries — to make sure that patients who often suffer from severe health conditions are finding products that are right for them. To that end, regulators are considering introducing an app called Cannify to mediate interactions between medical patients and budtenders. Using a comprehensive questionnaire, the program would help steer patients toward proper treatment options. “We feel like this might be a useful tool in the tool box to make sure that our budtenders, who are economically motivated, are not kind of making recommendations about products to people who have very serious health conditions,” Pepper told lawmakers Wednesday.  Regulators are also recommending that lawmakers move to modify the process for evaluating and approving medical conditions that would qualify patients for medical marijuana usage to help expand access to the program. Currently, the legislature has sole authority to dictate what diagnoses would qualify patients, a process the Cannabis Control Board has recommended shifting to an independent regulatory authority of some kind.   “At what point are we going to turn that over to a regulatory process?” Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, said Wednesday. “Are we at that point with cannabis for medical relief? I think it’s a question that we should be talking about.” — Habib SabetIn the knowA federal judge in Burlington on Wednesday released Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Vermonter detained earlier this month by federal immigration authorities.Mahdawi, a student organizer at Columbia University and a lawful U.S. resident for a decade, was arrested by federal agents in Colchester during an interview as part of his U.S. citizenship naturalization process. Mahdawi’s is one of several high-profile cases involving the detention of noncitizen university students ostensibly for their campus activism in support of Palestinian human rights. At Wednesday’s hearing, U.S. District Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford ruled from the bench, allowing Mahdawi to walk free on his own recognizance after more than two weeks in a Vermont prison while his deportation case continues in immigration court.Read more about the court ruling here. — Ethan WeinsteinLast week, AmeriCorps began terminating nearly $400 million in grants across the country that funded thousands of jobs, including about $2.4 million in funding for service positions in Vermont. An April 25 grant termination letter said the state’s grant “no longer effectuates agency priorities” and demanded that recipients “immediately cease all award activities.” Several days after that notice arrived, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a multi-state lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s termination of AmeriCorps grants and positions. The terminations impact about 200 positions, said Philip Kolling, the executive director of SerVermont which oversees the bulk of the state’s AmeriCorps members. About 70 are currently filled, with many slated to begin this spring and summer, he said. Some are government positions and many others are at nonprofits. The funding cuts constitute about 40% of the roughly $6 million Vermont receives annually for AmeriCorps programs, Kolling said. Positions that focus on anti-poverty initiatives and programming for seniors are not impacted by the terminations, he added.A separate AmeriCorps program, focused on affordable housing and disaster recovery, dismissed its members earlier this month, ending their service terms early and sending them home. The corps members under the SerVermont umbrella have not been officially let go. Read more about the impacts of the cuts on the AmeriCorps programs here. — Carly BerlinOn the HillU.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., brought up the recent detention of eight workers on a large dairy farm in Franklin County by federal immigration authorities during the Wednesday confirmation hearing for Rodney Scott, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Welch’s office created a video clip showing the roughly five-minute exchange. “We’ve got to milk our cows. We’ve got to have access to labor. None of these folks have any criminal record, and, really, this is a question about priorities,” Welch said. Scott answered, in part, that he doesn’t support “asking law enforcement officers not to enforce the law that’s in front of them.”Welch also got to ask about the changes required at the Haskell Free Library in Derby Line, which straddles an international border and serves both Canadian and U.S. patrons: “I get that you’ve got to ‘enforce the law,’ but is it a real issue about Canadians coming into the Canadian side of a Vermont library to get a book?” Since the U.S. border agency began requiring visitors from Canada to show ID at the door — with further restrictions on entry to come this fall — the library has opened up a back door into the building directly from Stanstead, Quebec.  Scott said he would commit to talking through any concerns about the arrangement and “we’re not going to make decisions in a vacuum.”— Kristen FountainRead the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Regulators prepare to roll out medical cannabis sales at Vermont’s recreational dispensaries.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/first-day-cannabis-3-20220923.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 19:05:35.885634

The situation has stoked frustration for Trudeau, who would like to see the legislation swiftly enacted. It also underscores Ferguson’s reluctance to weigh in publicly on many of the biggest policy debates that unfolded over the past four months, ahead of the session wrapping up Sunday.
“I don’t want to assign any nefarious motives,” Trudeau, D-Tacoma, said in an interview Wednesday. “I honestly feel confused.”

There’ve been other frictions between Democratic lawmakers and the first-term Democratic governor during his opening months in office, including over Ferguson’s opposition to their wealth tax and other revenue proposals amid a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall. 
“This confusion, this last-minute position or non-position, that feels pretty on-par for what it’s felt like,” Trudeau said.
Talking to reporters Friday about the rent legislation, House Bill 1217, and another controversial bill to give unemployment benefits to workers on strike, the governor said “there’s different perspectives on those bills within the Democratic caucus, and I respect that.”
At the time, lawmakers were on the cusp of passing both bills after extensive debate. 
“We’re having conversations, and want to be helpful, and I’m confident they’ll get to a resolution on both those bills and get those to my desk, but we’re letting that process play out,” continued Ferguson.
‘I want to be proud of him’
On Wednesday, the governor’s communications director, Brionna Aho, said in a statement that the governor’s office has a process to “thoroughly review” bills after they pass. “The governor has rarely offered public comment on bills prior to the completion of that process,” Aho said.
“The governor is supportive of the policy, but we need to complete our process before he offers further comment,” she said of the rent bill.
Aho pointed out that there have been multiple versions of the legislation and that changes were still being made to it in the final two days of the session. 
But the main goal of the proposal — to cap rent increases across the state — has remained the same for months. 
The bill would limit annual rent increases to 7% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower, for the next 15 years. It would also allow for only 5% rent hikes for manufactured homes in perpetuity. Landlords also wouldn’t be able to raise rents in the first 12 months of a tenancy. New construction would be exempt for its first 12 years. 
As lawmakers hammered out these details throughout the session, Ferguson’s staff told them the governor would sign whatever final compromise they reached, said Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds, the chair of the House Housing Committee.
Trudeau is pleading with Ferguson to sign the bill as soon as possible. The restrictions on rent hikes would go into effect immediately upon his signature. She worries landlords are speeding up rent increases, knowing they’ll be restricted once Ferguson OKs it. 
Before joining the state Senate, Trudeau worked with Ferguson for years in the attorney general’s office, including as his legislative director. In her experience, when he supports legislation, he makes that clear. 
In this case, his staff even worked with sponsors to figure out what changes could be made to the contentious rent legislation to curry votes from on-the-fence Democrats, she said.
It’s not the first time Trudeau has directed critical feedback toward her former boss. She was also the most vocal lawmaker last month about hostile workplace concerns in Ferguson’s office, caused by former top adviser Mike Webb, who resigned. 
Trudeau said she was proud of many of Ferguson’s actions while he was attorney general.
“I want to be proud of him as governor,” Trudeau said. “When the pressure is high is exactly when we need to show up for our people.”
‘Long road ahead’
Landlords and developers ardently opposed the rent legislation, arguing it would force them to leave the state. Well-funded housing industry groups targeted moderate Democratic senators to get them to vote against House Bill 1217.
On Wednesday, the Housing Solutions Coalition urged Ferguson to veto the proposed law, arguing it “will further hurt renters by driving down housing stock.” The coalition is led by Marcia Fudge, the former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Biden Administration, and Steve Stivers, a Republican former congressman from Ohio.
The policy’s supporters say it’ll give predictability to renters, and highlight other bills passed this year to boost housing supply, along with $605 million in new funding for affordable housing in the state’s Housing Trust Fund.
As part of Ferguson’s transition to the governor’s mansion, Lt. Gov. Denny Heck presented a plan of attack to deal with the state’s housing crisis. One of the report’s premises was to figure out a way to prevent price-gouging, and the rent legislation does that, Heck recently told reporters.
“The question is, are the rules too constrictive for them to make the investment?” asked Heck, also a Democrat. “And that’s what I don’t know the answer to. I don’t think any of us does.”
Trudeau recognizes it’s normal for new officials, especially governors, to feel things out in their first legislative session. She just wants Ferguson to quickly stand up for working people and renters. 
“We’ve got a long road ahead of us and we hope he can figure it out,” Trudeau said.

,DC,2025-04-30 22:32:48+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House GOP advances Trump mass deportations plan with huge funding boosts,"Ariana Figueroa, Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-advances-trump-mass-deportations-plan-huge-funding-boosts,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Judiciary Republicans Wednesday worked in committee on a portion of a major legislative package that would help fund President Donald Trump’s plans to conduct mass deportations of people living in the United States without permanent legal status.The Judiciary panel's $81 billion share of the “one, big beautiful” bill the president has requested of Congress would provide $45 billion for immigration detention centers, $8 billion to hire thousands of immigration enforcement officers and more than $14 billion for deportations, among other things.The border security and immigration funds are part of a massive package that wraps together White House priorities including tax cuts and defense spending boosts. Republicans are pushing the deal through using a special procedure known as reconciliation that will allow the Senate GOP to skirt its usual 60-vote threshold when that chamber acts.House Republicans returning from a two-week recess kicked off their work on reconciliation Tuesday, approving three of 11 bills out of committees on Armed Services, Education and Workforce and Homeland Security.On Wednesday, lawmakers continued work on the various sections of the reconciliation bill with markups — which means a bill is debated and potentially amended or rewritten — in the Financial Services, Judiciary, Transportation and Infrastructure and Oversight and Government Reform committees.House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said Republicans will spend the rest of this week and next debating the 11 separate bills in committees. Committees when they finish their measures will send them to the House Budget Committee, which is expected to bundle them together prior to a floor vote.The Judiciary panel’s 116-page bill vastly overhauls U.S. asylum laws. It would, for example, create a fee structure for asylum seekers that would set a minimum cost for an application at no less than $1,000. Applications now are free.“These and other resources and fees in this reconciliation bill will ensure the Trump administration has the adequate resources to enforce the immigration laws in a fiscally responsible way,” GOP Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio said.The bill would establish a $1,000 fee for immigrants granted temporary protected status, which would mean they would have work authorizations and deportation protections.It would also require sponsors to pay $3,500 to take in an unaccompanied minor who crosses the border without a legal status. Typically, unaccompanied minors are released to sponsors who are family members living in the United States.The bill would also require immigrants without permanent legal status to pay a $550 fee for work permits every six months.The top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, slammed the bill as targeting immigrants.“Every day, this administration uses immigration enforcement as a template to erode constitutional rights and liberties,” he said.A final committee vote was expected Wednesday night.‘A giveaway to ICE’The Judiciary bill directs half of the fees collected from asylum seekers to go toward the agency that handles U.S. immigration courts, but Democrats criticized the provisions as creating a barrier for asylum seekers.“The so-called immigration fees that are in this bill are really fines and nothing but a cruel attempt to make immigrating to this country impossible,” Washington Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal said.Democratic Rep. Chuy Garcia of Illinois, said the bill would not only “gut asylum” but would significantly increase funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention.Funding for ICE detention this fiscal year is roughly $3.4 billion, but the Judiciary bill would sharply increase that to $45 billion.Garcia called the increase a “a giveaway to ICE, a rogue agency that's terrorizing communities and clamping (down) on civil liberties and the Constitution itself, because they've been directed to do so by this president.”House Republicans have also included language that would move the Federal Trade Commission into the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, a move Democrats argued would kneecap the FTC’s regulatory authority.“You're trying to shutter the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, making it harder for us to enforce our antitrust laws,” Democratic Rep. Becca Balint of Vermont said.Consumer protections to take a hitLawmakers on the House Committee on Financial Services met in a lengthy, and at times tense, session to finalize legislation to cut “no less than” $1 billion from government programs and services under the panel’s jurisdiction, according to the budget resolution Congress approved in April.Funds in the crosshairs include those previously authorized for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and grants provided under the Biden administration-era Inflation Reduction Act for homeowners to improve energy efficiency.Chair French Hill said the committee “will do its part to reduce the deficit and decrease direct spending, so that Congress can enact pro-growth tax policies.”""And remember, today, we are here with one purpose, to do our part to put our nation back on a responsible fiscal trajectory,"" the Arkansas Republican said.Democrats introduced dozens of amendments during the hourslong session to block cuts to community block grants and programs protecting consumers, including veterans, from illegal credit and lending practices.Ranking member Maxine Waters said committee Republicans’ plans to cut the CFPB by 70% “is ridiculous.”“The bureau has saved American consumers $21 billion by returning to them funds that big banks and predatory lenders swindled out of them,” said Waters, a California Democrat.Congress created the CFPB in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when subprime mortgage lending cascaded into bank failures and home and job losses.Republicans opposed amendment after amendment.Rep. María Salazar of Florida tossed a copy of one of Waters’ lengthy amendments straight into a trash can after a staffer handed it to her. Michigan’s Rep. Bill Huizenga held up proceedings for several minutes when he accused Waters of breaking the rules by not distributing enough paper copies of her amendment.“We cannot allow our government to continue spending money like there are no consequences,” GOP Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska said in response to several Democratic amendments.A final committee vote was expected Wednesday night.Transportation section adds fees on electric vehiclesThe House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee also approved, by a party line 36-30 vote, reconciliation instructions that would cut $10 billion from the federal deficit while boosting spending for the U.S. Coast Guard and the air traffic control system.Like other portions of the larger reconciliation package, the transportation committee’s instructions would add funding for national security and border enforcement, through the Coast Guard funding, while cutting money from programs favored by Democrats, including climate programs and any spending that could be construed as race-conscious.The bill would provide $21.2 billion for the Coast Guard and $12.5 billion for air traffic control systems. It would raise money through a $250 annual fee on electric vehicles and a $100 annual fee on hybrids, while also cutting $4.6 billion from climate programs created in Democrats’ 2022 reconciliation package.Chairman Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, said the measure included priorities for members of both parties, as well as business and labor interests.“We all want to invest in our Coast Guard,” he said. “We all want to rebuild our air traffic control system and finally address the broken Highway Trust Fund. We have held countless hearings on all of these topics, both recently and, frankly, for years. And now members have the opportunity to actually act.”Democrats on the panel complained that the reconciliation package was a partisan exercise and a departure from the panel’s normally congenial approach to business. They introduced dozens of amendments over the daylong committee meeting seeking to add funding for various programs. None were adopted.“The larger Republican reconciliation package will add more than $15 trillion in new debt, gives away $7 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts to the wealthy and slashes access to health care and food assistance for families,” ranking Democrat Rick Larsen of Washington said. “Given that, I think we're going to have to vote no on the bill before us.”The vehicle fees, which would be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund that sends highway and transit money to states, created a partisan divide Wednesday.Federal gas taxes provide the lion’s share of deposits to the fund and Republicans argued that, because drivers of electric vehicles pay no gas taxes and hybrid drivers pay less than those who drive gas-powered cars, the provision would make the contributions fairer.Republicans scrapped a proposed $20 annual fee on gas-powered cars, which Graves said was meant to “start a conversation” on the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund. But the provision “became a political distraction that no longer centered around seriously addressing the problem,” he said.Pennsylvania Democrat Chris Deluzio criticized the vehicle fees, noting Republicans were pursuing additional revenue opportunities to offset losses from tax cuts.“I don't know when you guys became the tax-and-spend liberals,” Deluzio told his Republican colleagues. “But I guess the taxing of car owners so you can pay for tax giveaways to billionaires is your new strategy. Good luck with that.”Federal employee benefits targetedThe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform voted nearly along party lines, 22-21, to send its portion of the reconciliation package to the Budget Committee, with Ohio Republican Rep. Mike Turner joining Democrats in opposition.Turner was the first GOP lawmaker to cast a committee vote against reconciliation instructions this year.The legislation hits at federal employee benefits and comes as the Trump administration continues to overhaul the federal workforce.Part of the bill would raise federal employees’ required retirement contribution to a rate of 4.4% of their salary and eliminate an additional retirement annuity payment for federal employees who retire before the age of 62, while cutting more than $50 billion from the federal deficit.At his committee’s markup, Chairman James Comer said the legislation “advances important budgetary reforms that will save taxpayers money.”The Kentucky Republican acknowledged that the chief investigative committee in the U.S. House has “very limited jurisdiction to help reduce the federal budget deficit,” noting that the panel is “empowered to pursue civil service reforms, including federal employee benefits and reining in the influence of partisan and unaccountable government employee unions.”But Democrats on the panel blasted the committee’s portion of the reconciliation package, saying the bill chips away at federal employees’ protections.Rep. Stephen Lynch, the top Democrat on the panel, said congressional Republicans instructed the panel to target the federal workforce with roughly $50 billion in funding cuts “regardless of the impact on hard-working, loyal federal employees and their critical services that they provide to the American people.”The Massachusetts Democrat said the bill “threatens to further undermine the federal workforce by reducing the take-home pay, the benefits and workforce protections of 2.4 million federal employees, most of whom are middle-class Americans and a third of whom are military veterans.”Ohio’s Turner, who voted against the legislation because of the provision reducing pension benefits, said he supported the overall reconciliation package and hoped the pension measure would be stripped before a floor vote.Turner said “making changes to pension retirement benefits in the middle of someone’s employment is wrong.”",,,,2025-04-30 19:05:35.885634

(Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers advanced sweeping nutrition legislation that would regulate purchases of sugary beverages with federal food assistance and limit what ingredients can be served in public school school lunches. 
Senate Bill 14 by Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, cleared the Louisiana Senate Committee of Health and Welfare on a party-line 4-3 vote, with Republicans prevailing.
McMath’s bill is part of a nationwide backlash against “ultra-processed foods,” food dyes, seed oils and certain chemicals in foods that U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has targeted for elimination. 
Kennedy is the central figure of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. McMath said he is working with Kennedy on his bill. 
“I think, for the first time in a very long time, and perhaps maybe ever, Americans, Louisianians, are paying close attention to what our individual health outcomes are and our individual health outcomes for our children and our grandchildren,” McMath said. 
Democrats on the committee raised concerns that the legislature is not taking a holistic look at the factors causing poor health outcomes in Louisiana. 
“Louisiana has a lot of chemical industry in our state. Those plants produce a lot of carcinogens that’s in the air we breathe, and we tend to turn our backs sometimes and let those things go,” Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, said. “So we need to be more mindful and consider all of those things.” 
In an interview after the hearing, McMath said his bill is a starting point toward addressing larger issues in Louisiana. 
“The types of environments that we’re surrounded by can be pretty toxic,” McMath said. “And while I would love to wave a magic wand and clean up air and water and other things, I think the lowest hanging fruit … is we can start with the food that we’re that we’re putting in our body.” 
The original version of his legislation banned the purchase of soft drinks with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits but was amended to prohibit buying beverages with more than five grams of added sugar or any artificial sweetener. Drinks that include milk or milk substitutes would be exempt from this prohibition. 
Democrats also objected to this provision of the bill, saying it would further marginalize poor children who could be ostracized for not being able to afford lunchbox items their peers can. 
McMath’s SNAP restrictions are actually more limited than those in previous legislative proposals, which have included bans on chips and candy. McMath said he was aware many Louisianians live in food deserts, and he did not want to prevent people who might only be able to shop at convenience stores from eating. 
If McMath’s bill passes, the state would still have to receive permission from the federal government to limit SNAP benefits. 
Further amendments on the bill removed references to “ultra-processed” foods and instead listed ingredients prohibited in school lunches. They include food dyes that are common allergens and zero-calorie sweeteners such as sucralose, more commonly known as Splenda. 
The committee adopted amendments to allow food items with prohibited ingredients to be sold in vending machines and from concession stands at school events. 
The bill also requires food packages to include a warning that the contents “may be harmful to your health” if it includes certain ingredients. That list includes aspartame, a common zero-calorie sweetener. 
McMath’s legislation would also require restaurants to post notices when they use oils derived from the seeds of plants. 
Certain medical professionals would be required to take nutrition courses as part of their continuing education under the bill that heads next to the Senate floor.

Beth Bernstein, D-Columbia, talks about a bill that would double state employees' paid parental leave Wednesday, April 30, 2025. (Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — State employees in South Carolina who newly become parents could get twice as much paid leave under a bill the House passed this week.
The bipartisan bill sent to the Senate on Wednesday by a vote of 86-18 would give employees of K-12 schools, state agencies, and public colleges 12 weeks of paid leave after giving birth instead of six. Non-birthing parents, including fathers and adoptive parents, would qualify for four weeks instead of two.
With four working days left in the 2025 session and no movement on an identical bill in the Senate, passage this year is highly unlikely. But the bill remains alive for 2026. It does not need to be reintroduced.
The House passed an identical bill three years ago. But only half the time made it into law due to senators’ concerns about cost. Sponsors in both chambers celebrated passage while vowing to try again.
Six weeks is not enough, said Rep. Beth Bernstein, again the bill’s primary House sponsor.
Not only are the first weeks of a child’s life vital for parents to bond with their new child, but increasing the state’s leave to 12 weeks could make it more competitive in the job market, Bernstein said.
“Whether I’m the birthing parent or not, the bond you have with your child, particularly at birth, is something that is special and something that should be preserved,” the Columbia Democrat said.
Cost remained a concern for the bill’s opponents.
The cost for state agencies and school districts is unclear, since it will depend on how many employees use the leave and what job they’re performing. Some departments might need to offer incentives to other workers to take over for that worker while they’re gone or hire temporary workers, according to a financial analysis of the bill.
One particular point of contention was the cost to school districts, which would have to offer the same benefit to teachers and other full-time employees. That cost would also vary, since the cost of hiring a substitute teacher fluctuates based on their experience and location, according to the analysis.
Still, some legislators, especially in the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, questioned whether the bill could cause school districts to raise property taxes in an effort to recoup the costs of paying for the extra six weeks of leave.
“You’re voting to take more money away from people who don’t have benefits and give it to people who do have benefits,” said Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a Campobello Republican and vice-chairman of the Freedom Caucus.
Rep. Neal Collins pointed to his own school district as evidence more money’s not necessary.
Pickens County adopted a policy earlier this week providing 12 weeks of paid parental leave. The district estimates the cost at $115,000 per year, an amount that won’t require a tax increase, the Easley Republican said.
Magnuson, a father of two young children, also characterized the bill as government overreach in telling parents how long they could stay home. And he criticized the bill’s wording for referring to eligible employees as those who “give birth” versus a “co-parent” instead of mother and father.
“I don’t know about you, but I think that our government should acknowledge mothers and should acknowledge fathers,” said Magnuson, who’s also a charter member of the Family Caucus.
Bernstein called Magnuson’s arguments disingenuous, particularly considering he voted in favor of the House’s previous attempt to approve 12 weeks of paid leave.
Most legislators who voted against the bill are in the Freedom Caucus, which has some overlap with the Family Caucus.
They promote themselves as advocates for families yet voted against a bill that would keep families together longer, she said.
“For those of you in this chamber who talk about family and family preservation and the family bonding and vote against this bill, that does not make sense,” Bernstein said.
Those first weeks were vital for Rep. Travis Moore’s wife when she gave birth to the couple’s first child 15 years ago, the Roebuck Republican said.
“I think there are so many things that happen developmentally and relationally in those first few weeks and months,” Moore said.
To allow his wife to stay home longer, coworkers in the solicitor’s office where she worked donated some of their time off so she could spend more weeks at home with her baby, he said.
She wanted to stay home for 12 weeks, but the couple couldn’t afford that, Moore said.
“She really wanted to be home longer, but we weren’t in a position for her not to go to work,” Moore said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-30-at-5.04.38-PM-1024x519.png,,,2025-04-30 19:05:35.885634

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton has one priority if she is elected to the U.S. Senate in 2026: fighting back against President Donald Trump’s policies.

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton has one priority if she is elected to the U.S. Senate in 2026: fighting back against President Donald Trump’s policies.

“What I'm just seeing is that the old playbook in Washington, D.C., isn't working,” Stratton said Wednesday in an interview with Capitol News Illinois. ""People aren't – as I talk to working families across Illinois – they're not looking for people to just talk. They want to see real action, and that's exactly what we've done in our administration.”

Stratton, a Chicago Democrat, entered politics in 2016, inspired by being her mother’s primary caregiver as she battled Alzheimer’s disease. She defeated an incumbent Democratic state representative that year and was elected lieutenant governor two years later after Gov. JB Pritzker chose her as his running mate.

She quickly set her sights on Washington, D.C., when U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, a Springfield Democrat, announced April 24, that he won’t seek reelection in 2026.

“My struggle is the struggle of so many Illinoisans who may not be able to pay attention to every policy paper or every piece of legislation that is being pushed forward, but they just need to know that somebody is out there fighting,” Stratton said.

Over the last six years, Pritzker has sung his governing partner’s praises, crediting Stratton with being a leading voice on the administration’s top priorities. Pritzker typically gets the headlines, but Stratton said playing second in command still gives her a hefty record to present to voters when they ask what she has done to stand up to Trump.

“I will be able to turn and say Gov. Pritzker and I, working as a team, were able to lower the cost of groceries, we protected health care, we expanded your rights, and we made sure that we stood up for working families of Illinois,” Stratton said.

Raising Illinois’ minimum wage to $15 an hour was one of the first legislative accomplishments of Pritzker’s administration in 2019. But the federal minimum wage hasn’t increased beyond $7.25 since 2009.

“We raised the minimum wage,” Stratton said. “That has not happened on the federal level yet, and yet, people know that raising the minimum wage helps lift people up out of poverty.”

“Kitchen table issues” are voters’ top concern, Stratton said, citing economic uncertainty surrounding tariffs and potential cuts to social services.

While she’s made her name in state policymaking, a congressional run necessitates that Stratton weigh in on broader issues, such as foreign policy.

Stratton declined to discuss her position on Israel’s war with Hamas, and whether Israel should agree to a ceasefire with hostages still being held in Gaza.

“What people want, and need, is a stable leader in D.C.,” Stratton said. “Right now, with Donald Trump, we don't have that. We don't have someone who is focused on global issues overall and the impact.”

Blocking Trump’s agenda must be the first priority, Stratton said, to allow congressional Democrats to move forward on proposals that address voters’ concerns. She said she didn’t know yet what her first bill would be should she win the seat.

“I don't think anything's more important than making sure that government works for the people and that we are creating opportunity,” she said. “But how are we going to do any of those things if we don't stand up against somebody who's trying to strip away rights, fundamental freedoms, overlook the rule of law.”

Stratton remains the only high-profile candidate in either party as of Thursday that’s announced a run for Durbin’s seat. She has already secured endorsements from Pritzker and U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth before any other Democrats announce their candidacy.

Durbin acknowledged in a prior news conference that Stratton reached out to him before he announced his retirement to say she was interested in running for his seat.

“The conversations that we had, while I won't go into specifics, was just making sure that he understood what my plans were and how much I respect his leadership,” Stratton said.

“It’s not really great to have to think about how dangerous it is to work in America,” Crowley told the crowd. 
Union leaders want state leaders to strike now on a trio of bills they say will ensure more workers can be protected from physical dangers as well as anti-union messaging. Among those priorities: ending the exemption from the state’s indoor smoking ban at Rhode Island’s two casinos.
“We’ve known for decades that smoking kills,” Crowley said. “That’s why it’s important that we pass legislation to ban smoking in these casinos.”
Matt Dunham, president of Table Game Dealers Laborers Local 711, said the local’s 600 workers have to endure second-hand smoke every time they enter Bally’s Lincoln and Tiverton facilities.
“They’re tired of going to work each day wondering if they’re putting their future health on the line to put food on the table tonight,” Dunham said.
Workers have made the push to end Bally’s exemption for years, only to be stalled at the committee level. But that changed after House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi allowed a symbolic committee vote to advance the proposal at the end of the 2024 legislative session. 
Shekarchi is now one of the 10 cosponsors listed on the latest edition of the bill to end the exemption the casinos have from the state’s indoor smoking ban. The bill is sponsored by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat and has the backing of 55 of the chamber’s 75 members. The House Committee on Finance held an initial hearing on Tanzi’s bill on April 10, when it was held for further study — as is standard practice for a first look by a legislative panel.
In the Senate, however, passage of a smoking ban has faced repeated roadlocks.
The late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio had been a staunch opponent of such legislation, citing concerns it could decrease revenue. The chamber’s new majority leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, has expressed the same concern.
But newly-elected Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, said she personally supports the measure, chamber spokesperson Greg Paré confirmed in an email Wednesday.
“But it is also her understanding that the parties are working together towards a resolution that would not require legislation,” Paré said in an email. “At the same time, the legislation will undergo the normal, public committee review process.”
Legislation introduced Feb. 7 by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat, has yet to be scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming.

Can’t stand the heat? Fix the kitchens
Union leaders believe the state also needs to act on companion bills that would establish standards for working in extreme heat and cold.
Katarina Ezikovich, an organizer with SEIU 1199NE, knows firsthand the dangers workers face during extreme heat. A lab technician at Women & Infants Hospital, she recalled how the hospital’s HVAC system failed over the winter.
The kitchen staff felt the impact first.
“People were as red as the potatoes they roasted. They sweated more than the onions. Haute cuisine had nothing on the flambé that our employees were becoming,” Ezikovich said. “The puns here might be funny, but what wasn’t funny was our employer’s response.”
Ezikovich claimed hospital administrators advised workers to drink Gatorade and take extra breaks. Care New England spokesperson Raina Smith said the hospital network is aware of the concerns raised by union workers and that a temporary HVAC solution has been in place since mid-February. 
“We remain committed to transparency and to upholding the highest standards of safety, quality, and respect for every member of our hospital community,” she said in an emailed statement.
But Ezikovich said the hospital has not fixed the problem and that their bosses’ solutions have been nothing more than “a Band-Aid on a gaping, gushing wound.”
“You can only take so many breaks before returning to a hellfire work site,” she said.
Union leaders believe such issues can be mitigated under companion bills by Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat, and Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat. Their legislation would require employers to provide workers with adequate heating and cooling equipment, access to paid rest breaks, along with training to recognize and mitigate heat and cold-related risks.
Morales’ bill received its initial committee hearing Feb. 12, while DiPalma’s bill had its first review by a Senate panel on March 12. Both bills were held for further study.

No more mandatory meetings
Rhode Island labor leaders are also targeting an end to so-called “captive audience meetings” — mandatory employer gatherings where workers are required to hear company views on religion, politics, or unions.
Such meetings are allegedly used by employers to convince their workers that they’d be better off without a union, said Teamsters Local 251 organizer Patrick Leonard.
“They’ll pull workers on the shop floor into a conference room, close the door behind them, outnumber them with management and tell them this is a voluntary meeting.” he told the crowd.
A growing number of states have begun to ban such meetings, including Connecticut in 2022. Captive audience meetings were deemed unlawful by the National Labor Relations Board in November 2024.
Rhode Island’s Senate has already passed such legislation earlier in April. The bill sponsored by Sen. Matthew LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat, would prohibit employers from punishing or firing workers who choose not to attend meetings or read messages where the company shares its views on religion or politics.
Workers who believe they were unfairly disciplined or fired would be allowed to sue their employer to get their job back, receive financial compensation, and have their legal fees covered.
Leonard said codifying such protections would give workers reassurance that they can hold onto their own beliefs without risk of being fired.
LaMountain’s bill is before the House where companion legislation by Rep. Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, was held for further study by the chamber’s Committee on Labor on April 2.

(Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)











With a potential rail workers strike threatening to shut down train service to New York City in mid-May, NJ Transit officials are urging tens of thousands of workers to consider working from home.
Kris Kolluri, the transit agency’s new CEO and president, said Wednesday that if the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, the union that represents rail engineers, opts to strike and halt service, “the responsibility and the blame will be squarely on them.”
The agency presented a contingency plan that would begin May 19 to help people who can’t work from home get to their jobs by bus from four key regional park-and-ride lots. But the bus plan will only accommodate about a fifth of the commuters who use trains daily, Kolluri said.
“I’ve said this very clearly. Each train carries a thousand people on average. Each bus can carry a hundred people if it’s an articulated bus,” he said. “That’s why I want to be crystal clear here. This is not a replacement of our rail system. This is a plan to mitigate so essential workers can get to work in New York and other places in a safe and efficient manner.”
The contingency plan will cost $4 million daily, he added.
“We are in a very, very challenging time. We may be facing a recession in the not-too-distant future. Tariffs are going to have an impact on what we’re doing when we purchase buses, our ability to run trains,” he said. “This is not the time to take an agency which is finally standing up on its feet and take a two-by-four to it.”

The warning to commuters comes after tense negotiations. In March, it seemed like the two parties reached a deal before it fell apart. Two weeks ago, train engineers overwhelmingly rejected the last contract offer from NJ Transit, beginning a 30-day countdown to a strike. Kolluri said the agency and the union resumed negotiations Wednesday morning but remain at odds over the proposed salary increase. 
Under the union’s proposed contract, fares would rise 17%, and the corporate transit fee — which helps fund NJ Transit’s budget — would climb 27%, Kolluri said. He estimated it would cost $1.4 billion. 
An engineer, on average, earns about $135,000 annually, including overtime, and the agency offered a new contract with an average salary of $172,000, he said.
But not all engineers make overtime, workers are leaving in droves to make more on other commuter rail lines, and the price tag Kolluri cited is “drastically” overstated, said Tom Haas, general chairman of the 430-member union. 
“Engineers are leaving NJT, stepping across the platform to positions at other railroads with wages 20% or more higher, doing the same work in the same place. BLET engineers want to keep providing the professionalism and service they’re known for,” Haas said. “They’re counting on NJT to recognize the economic reality their engineers face and bring a fair deal to the table with equal pay for equal work.”
Kolluri didn’t sound hopeful about averting a strike, adding it’s something the union is “seemingly hell-bent on seeing through. It doesn’t have to be this way.”
He urged commuters to keep up to date on strike news, as they decide whether to buy daily tickets or monthly passes, which will be cross-honored at park-and-rides. Commuters can find signs, at stations across the state, with QR codes that lead to information on the strike and expanded bus service.

Darryl Rouson infuriated both Democratic and Republican senators Wednesday. Even Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier used the episode to launch another attack […],"Sen. Darryl Rouson . (Screenshot/Florida Channel)A Florida House amendment that killed plans for a substance abuse and mental health research center at the University of South Florida to be named after Tampa Bay Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson infuriated both Democratic and Republican senators Wednesday.
Even Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier used the episode to launch another attack on the House.
The legislation (SB 1620), which has passed both chambers in some form now, would make a raft of changes to Florida’s Mental Health Act. The original bill included a Center for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Research at USF’s Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute.
The center would have conducted statewide behavioral health research, promote evidence-based practices, and improved workforce development. An amendment added by Pinellas County Republican Ed Hooper would have named the facility the “Rouson Center,” after Rouson, who has battled drug and alcohol addiction in his past and had sponsored the measure in the Senate.
However, an amendment sponsored by Broward County Democrat Christine Hunschofsky and passed by the House on Tuesday deleted the facility — Rouson’s name and all.
So when the bill came back to the Senate on Wednesday, Rouson told his colleagues that while he was disappointed about that development, they should still go ahead and pass the measure.
‘The establishment of this center means a great deal to those who believe in advancing mental health care with evidence-based compassion,” Rouson told his colleagues. “Unfortunately, the House didn’t see it our way, and for me, it is more important that the work continue, that the work of the commission be honored.”
He referred to the Florida Commission on Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder.
Some senators said that out of respect to Rouson they would still vote for the bill. But others insisted they would not.
“It’s not right, it’s not fair, it’s not appropriate, and it really isn’t acceptable,” Tampa Bay-area Republican Jim Boyd said. “I promise you we will make this right.”
“I’m just glad that in a year-and-a-half we’ll have another speaker who will hopefully support the naming of the program after you,” Naples GOP Sen. Kathleen Passidomo said, referring to House Speaker Daniel Perez.
GOP Sens. Jay Collins and Blaise Ingoglia both called the House move “a travesty.”
“I am angry beyond words,” said Ingoglia.
“It hurts. It hurts because I’m somebody in recovery,” said Democratic Sen. Rosalind Osgood, who said she would oppose the measure.
Countdown
The dispute took place just two days before the 60-day legislative session was scheduled to end, but, with the sides still divided on a budget and tax reductions, the session will have to be extended or the Legislature come back before the budget would take effect on July 1
Shortly after the vote, Gov. DeSantis, who has been battling the House for the past month on various issues, including taxes, weighed in, responding on X, “The Florida House of Pettiness in all its glory…”
“Senator @darrylrouson is a class act,” added Attorney General James Uthmeier on X.
The budget fight involves Perez’s insistence on lowering the sales tax to the tune of around $5 billion. Senate President Ben Albritton is worried about what happens if a recession hits.
According to the original legislation, the purpose of the center was to conduct “rigorous and relevant research intended to develop knowledge and practice in prevention and intervention for substance abuse and mental health issues, to serve the people and economy in this state in reducing the gap between population needs and the availability of effective treatments and other interventions to improve the capacity of the state to have healthy, resilient communities prevailing over substance abuse, addiction, and mental health challenges.”
The Senate opted to temporarily postpone action on the legislation. They have just two days to decide on whether they want to approve it.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana cabinet members, lawmakers, lobbyists and more gathered Wednesday to celebrate Gov. Mike Braun’s first 100 days in office — but the man of the hour had tough words for his second-in-command, critics of his marquee legislative accomplishments and the health care industry.
Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith enraged civil rights activists and historians alike last Thursday when he dubbed the U.S. Constitution’s Three-Fifths Compromise “a great move” toward ending slavery.

Braun didn’t publicly weigh in for a nearly a week.
“I definitely wouldn’t have used that characterization, and I don’t like it,” he told reporters Wednesday.
“I’m a believer that you better start thinking about what you’re saying before it comes out,” he continued. “… And I think that you don’t want to make headlines the wrong way, because it takes away from the substance of what you’re trying to do.”
Braun also defended the local property and income tax plan that lawmakers pushed past the finish line this month amid outcry from hard-hit units of local government and dissatisfied homeowners.
“By far the biggest thing I heard about: we went from one version to a different version, and then the meat grinder of legislation took over,” he told attendees. “And look at the product that we turned out. … You’re pissing off people on each end of the spectrum and most in between say that it was a solid package.”
In comments to reporters, Braun envisioned further cuts to homestead property tax bills, done gradually “to where other sources of income can be used.” But he warned school districts and local governments that he wouldn’t allow their revenues to grow faster than the economy.
Former President Joe Biden got a knock as Braun said a grim revenue forecast forced lawmakers to cut $2 billion in spending out of the state’s next two-year, now-$44 billion budget in the space of a week.
“When it comes to what we really cut, nothing got hammered, and the most important stuff stayed intact,” he declared.
Most state agencies, along with public colleges and universities, were dealt 5% funding cuts. Lawmakers also squeezed eligibility requirements for the state’s pre-kindergarten program and subsidized child care.

But a two-year-old program to supplement local public health departments took a 60% cut, with funding falling from $100 million each year to $40 million. Legislative leaders argued that nearly half the funds disbursed last year hadn’t yet been spent.
“Don’t ever mistake that you got to have more money to do things better with. That’s called anti-productivity,” Braun replied, when asked about the public health funding cut. “When you come up with better ideas, you may need more money to invest, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but in most cases, when it comes to government, you’ve got plenty of money. You’ve just got to learn how to spend it better.”
But he didn’t rule out funding boosts in the future.
“Don’t mistake the short-run — where you get whipsawed — with what you want to do in the mid-term and the long-term,” Braun said. “So that means we may be pouring more resources into it, if we can get a good (return on investment).”
He had big hopes for the interim and legislative sessions to come, repeatedly noting how taking office days after the session’s start hampered his efforts to shape proposals. His first 100 days overlapped entirely with the breakneck budget-writing session, ending just over a day before both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly adjourned sine die.
Braun reiterated his desire to tackle high health care costs as his top priority now that session is over. In both his speech and comments to reporters, he asked players in the health care industry for solutions while threatening punishment for stasis.
“That and more will be brought to bear if, in fact, they’re not lowering their prices and giving us better outcomes,” Braun said.

(West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Wednesday signed into law a bill that, if things go the way he and other legislators hope, is meant to encourage data centers to locate in West Virginia and generate their own power sources through microgrids.
House Bill 2014 — dubbed the Power Generation and Consumption Act — was one of the more complicated bills to make it through the 2025 regular session. It was a late edition to Morrisey’s legislative agenda, being introduced on March 18 — more than halfway through the 60-day session.
The bill was subject to dozens of amendments as it made its way through both the House and Senate, including changes to how taxes collected on data centers would be distributed, policies regarding how microgrids would operate and requirements for those microgrids, as well as other utilities. The bill initially passed the House on April 1. After more changes in the Senate, lawmakers there approved their own version on April 11.
On the final night of session, the two chambers did find compromise on an even different version of the bill, with the House passing the amended version 82-16 with two members absent and not voting. The Senate concurred with the House’s changes to the legislation and voted yet again to pass the legislation, sending it to Morrisey’s desk for signage.
Those who voted against HB 2014 in both chambers shared concerns over the potential for electric rate increases if the bill were to pass. They also voiced discontent with measures that removed local control and enforcement of certain regulations for counties and municipalities where data centers could be built.
The version of the bill that now stands as law is aimed at recruiting the establishment of data centers in West Virginia. It allows any data centers that do locate here to curtail local zoning ordinances and other regulatory processes and establishes a certified microgrid program, which means data centers can produce and use their own power without attaching to already existing utilities.
The law also creates a specialized tax structure for data centers and microgrids, which must be placed in designated districts. Local governments have little say or control over those districts, which are established at the state level.
Taxes collected on any data centers and microgrids operating in West Virginia would be split as so: 50% will go to the personal income tax reduction fund, 30% will go to the county where the data center is located, 10% will go to the remaining 54 counties split on a per capita basis using the most recent U.S. Census, 5% will be placed in the Economic Enhancement Grant Fund administered by the Water Development Authority and the final 5% will be put in the newly created Electric Grid Stabilization and Security Fund.
That fund is meant to help existing utilities develop and maintain infrastructure for continued generation and transmission of coal-fired and natural gas-fueled power.
Morrisey signed the bill in Point Pleasant on Wednesday, right outside the future site of the Fidelis Monarch AI Data Center Campus.
“In order for West Virginia to reach its potential, we must continue to focus on economic development and utilizing our many natural resources,” Morrisey said. “The Power Generation and Consumption Act will make West Virginia the most attractive state in the country for data centers and help America better compete with China in the technology arms race of the future.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Patrick-Morrisey-20250430-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

He owns the nursing home with Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, among others. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)One of Louisiana’s most powerful legislators and his colleague are co-owners of a nursing home that faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of a former resident.
The case against their facility is playing out as both lawmakers and the rest of the Louisiana Legislature consider controversial legislation to undercut similar legal challenges. 
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, are part of a 10-person ownership group for the Acadia St. Landry Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Church Point. Hensgens is also the administrator of the nursing home. Two other members of his family are also part of the ownership group, according to state business records. 
The children of Cynthia Stewart filed a lawsuit and medical malpractice claim against Hensgens and Henry’s nursing home in April 2024, less than two months after Stewart died at age 74. She had spent almost 15 months as a resident at Acadia St. Landry when she developed a severe bed sore at the base of her spine in November 2023, according to the lawsuit her family filed in Louisiana’s 8th Judicial District Court in Winn Parish.
The amount of damages the Stewart family is seeking is not listed in court documents. 
Senate Bill 134 by Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, seeks to reduce the liability from wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits for dozens of Louisiana nursing homes – from potentially millions of dollars per institution to just $100,000. 
Henry and Hensgens say the legislation wouldn’t affect Acadia St. Landry because it has a different organizational structure than the facilities the bill is meant to shield. 

“We don’t have a management company, and that bill is exclusive for management companies,” Hensgens said  Tuesday in an interview. 

“There is no management company associated with Acadia St. Landry,” Henry said Tuesday in response to a question about the legislation. “The bill deals with management companies.” 

While Hensgens and Henry say the legislation won’t protect their business, nursing home lobbyists suggested in public testimony last week that the attorneys who filed the lawsuit against Acadia St. Landry are targets of the bill.

Garcia & Artigliere, which describes itself as a “nursing home neglect and abuse” law firm with offices in California, Arizona, Kentucky and Louisiana. It has 66 lawsuits pending against facilities in Louisiana, including Acadia St. Landry. 

The Louisiana Nursing Home Association claims the litigation threatens to put their industry out of business. 

“We’re going to have those health care facilities turning in their keys because they can’t do business in this state anymore” if these lawsuits continue, Wes Hattaway, policy director for the nursing home association, said at a legislative hearing last week. 
Also pushing the bill to protect nursing homes is Teddy Ray Price, part of the Acadia St. Landry ownership group with Henry and Hensgens. 

Price, who is also president of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association, and his family own two dozen nursing homes in Louisiana and a nursing home management company. Garcia & Artigliere has sued five of his facilities and Central Management Co., the nursing home management business he owns. 
Price could not be reached at his office or on his personal cellphone this week.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

‘You got to turn your mother’

According to the lawsuit, Stewart’s wound was only discovered when she was transferred from Acadia St. Landry to Maison de Lafayette Nursing Home. But by that time, it had grown so severe that her bone was exposed and she had contracted sepsis. She then had to be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment, according to the lawsuit. 

The family alleges the wound developed because Acadia St. Landry failed to provide proper medical supervision to Stewart while she was a resident. Her survivors claim Central Management Co. intentionally understaffed the nursing home to turn a higher profit. 

Acadia St. Landry ranks poorly, with only one out of five stars, on the widely accepted rating scale the federal Medicare program uses. A one-star rating describes a “much below average” facility, according to the Medicare website. The ratings are calculated based on the results of health inspections, staffing and other quality control measures government inspectors conduct. 

Registered nurses at Acadia St. Landry spent an average of nine minutes with each patient per day, compared with the national average of 40 minutes and a Louisiana average of 18 minutes, according to the federal data. 

The facility’s patient time with licensed professional nurses and licensed vocational nurses – who require less training and are paid far less than registered nurses – was higher than the national and state averages.

Geoffrey Stewart, Cynthia Stewart’s son, expanded on accusations in the lawsuit at a legislative committee hearing last week, though he didn’t identify the nursing home by name. He also didn’t mention that lawmakers own the facility. 
“The question that I have for you is: How difficult is it to turn a patient every two hours? Apparently, it’s really hard,” Stewart told legislators. “So hard that whenever I visited, I had to go search for employees to come and turn my mother. I had to bring cash with me every time I went to give money to [staff members to] come and turn my mother.”
“I was there. I went to that place. I visited her, knowing the fear that she was in. I went,” Stewart said. “But the message here tonight is, you can’t just go. You got to pull back sheets. You got to turn your mother.”
Henry declined to respond to the specifics of the Stewart case because of the pending litigation but said Acadia St. Landry meets state and federal staffing requirements. 
Lawsuit and legislation limits
Henry and Hensgens also insist that even though Price’s Central Management Co. is named in the Stewart lawsuit, it is not working with or for Acadia St. Landry.

The distinction over whether Central Management Co. or another management company has a hand in operations in Acadia St. Landry could be essential to the outcome of the lawsuit they face. 

Nursing homes are, in general, protected from large jury awards by Louisiana’s medical malpractice act, which caps damages against health care providers for unintentional injury at $500,000. 

Of that $500,000, a nursing home found to be negligent pays no more than $100,000. The rest of the money comes from a state pool fund that several types of health care providers contribute to for covering such claims.

Over the past year, Garcia & Artigliere has circumvented that cap by arguing that nursing home management companies like Central Management aren’t health care providers and shouldn’t be subjected to the medical malpractice law. Instead, they should be considered administrators that can be held responsible for larger jury awards.

Garcia & Artigliere have been successful in two such cases against Louisiana nursing homes so far. Its clients have received a $3.5 million verdict against Chateau St. James Rehab and Retirement in Lutcher and $2.1 million from Heritage Manor West in Shreveport. 
The purpose of Senate Bill 134 is to shut down this legal route to larger awards. Hattaway, with Louisiana Nursing Home Association, and others argue the state’s medical malpractice act was always meant to cover these types of negligence cases. The legislation would bring management companies for health care providers, including nursing homes and hospitals, under that legal cap. 
But if Acadia St. Landry is not using a management company, Hensgens said the medical malpractice law applies to their lawsuit whether the Pressly bill passes or not.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 

Big politics

Louisiana nursing home owners, some of the largest donor to candidates for the legislature and governor every election cycle, is the main supporter of the legislation. Price, as president of that powerful organization, attended last week’s hearing on Pressly’s bill in person but didn’t speak publicly. 
One of the few people who did testify in favor of the proposal was Troy Broussard, an attorney representing Hensgens, Henry, Price and other owners of Acadia St. Landry. 
Matt Coman, a New Orleans-based attorney with Garcia & Artigliere who represents the Stewart family, provided testimony in opposition to the legislation. 
AARP Louisiana, the state’s largest advocacy organization for seniors, also opposes the bill, saying it would put more elderly people at risk for abuse. 
“We’ve always maintained that our legislators should put their constituents ahead of any financial interests related to the outcome of the bill,” Andrew Muhl, AARP’s state director of advocacy, said in a statement this week. 

“If the supporters of this bill are successful, it means there will be a complete lack of due process for abuse and neglect due to perpetually poor and unsafe levels of basic care for our most vulnerable seniors,” Muhl said.

The committee sided overwhelmingly with the nursing home industry. Hensgens, as a committee member, voted with the 6-1 majority to move the legislation to the Senate floor. 

Neither Hensgens nor Henry had been part of a nursing home ownership group until 2022, when they bought Acadia St. Landry with Price and others. At the time, Henry was not in legislative leadership. Hensgens, who has worked in the nursing home industry for three decades, said he and his brother were responsible for putting together the buyers’ group. 

“My younger brother ran it for about 15 years for previous owners, and the gentleman got to be 85 years old. No one in the family wanted it, so he came to us and said, ‘Would you like to buy it?’” Hensgens said. “And we put together the investment group so we could afford it.” 
Nursing homes in Louisiana aren’t sold frequently, and there is state prohibition on any new homes opening.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Legislature-open-1772-1024x954.jpg,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

The legislation approved on a 4-2 party line vote would repeal the reproductive rights amendment known as Amendment 3 but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
If approved in the Senate, the proposal would be on a statewide ballot in November 2026. It could also be placed before voters earlier by Gov. Mike Kehoe.
With time growing short in this year’s session — lawmakers will have two weeks to complete their work after they adjourn Thursday — the Senate Families, Seniors and Health Committee held a public hearing and voted on the bill on the same day.
About 150 people packed the committee room to show support and opposition to the proposal sponsored by state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican. 
For the most ardent abortion opponents, the measure is a test of Republican fidelity to their cause.
“There is confidence, with a supermajority of Republicans at the helm, that those people who are pro-life at home know the representatives and senators in this building are going to do the right thing and bring this back to the vote of the people,” said Susan Klein, executive director of Missouri Right to Life.
Opponents again said the proposal seeks to overturn the will of Missouri voters.
“Stripping away people’s rights to their own god-given conscience in the face of some of the most intimate and tender decisions of their lives is an affront to our humanity and to god,” the Rev. Molly Housh Gordon of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Columbia said.
House Republicans spent the first three months of the session groping for a proposal that represented a consensus in their ranks. The proposal heard Wednesday passed out of the House earlier this month with only one Republican — House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit — in opposition. 
The measure would reinstate the almost total ban on abortions that was in place in Missouri from June 2022 until the passage of Amendment 3.
Patterson at a press conference following the mid-April vote said he had concerns with the limited exceptions allowed in the proposal..
“A debate that we should have — and I hope happens in the Senate — is 12 weeks long enough,” Patterson, a physician, said during the press conference. “ … If you’re going to say it’s OK to (have an abortion) after you’ve been raped, now we’re talking time limits.” 
But no changes were made to the proposal on Wednesday. 
Nonprofit sues to overturn Missouri’s parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions

State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from Kansas City, asked Seitz why he picked 12 weeks, noting that sexual violence is among the most under-reported crimes. 
Seitz said 12 weeks was chosen because it marks the end of the first trimester. 
In 2020, more than 93% of all abortions in the United States were performed prior to 13 weeks gestation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Crime data shows that  two out of every three sexual assaults are not reported to police, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In a research letter published in JAMA Internal Medicine, one group of researchers estimated that since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, more than 65,500 women and girls in the 14 states with abortion bans in place became pregnant after being raped.
Seitz has not made clear if or how survivors would have to prove the crime occurred in order to obtain an abortion. 
On Wednesday he said a reporting requirement was not necessary because state law already requires sexual crimes to be reported by physicians, for example. Under Missouri statute, some professions including health care workers are required to report suspicion of rape or incest to police, but only if the victim is under 18 years old. Physicians are not required to report sexual violence against adults.
“It’s also giving an incentive for those who know that a woman or girl has been sexually assaulted to get her to a rape crisis center, to get her to a counselor, to get her to a physician or nurse early enough in pregnancy so that she can make the decision that she needs to make,” longtime anti-abortion advocate and lobbyist Sam Lee said, testifying in support of the legislation.
The ballot language that would appear before voters does not explicitly say the amendment would ban abortions.
Instead, Missourians would be asked if they want to amend the Missouri constitution to: 

“Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; 
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and 
Protect children from gender transition?”

 Health care workers weigh in

Much of Wednesday’s opposition testimony Wednesday delved into details of health issues that women face during a difficult pregnancy.
Dr. Christine Jackson, an OBGYN in St. Louis, testified in opposition to the legislation, detailing the experience of one of her patients who learned she was pregnant after she was admitted to the ICU with diabetes complications. 
“When I met her, she was grappling not only with her acute illness, but hundreds of questions,” Jackson said. 
The issues the woman faced ranged from child care to her son at home to managing her diabetes while pregnant and the potential for serious complications. 
Jackson said the patient was too sick to go to an outpatient procedure facility for the abortion, and that she also didn’t meet the criteria for a medical emergency under Missouri’s abortion ban at the time. Jackson said the patient was also too sick to go to an outpatient procedure facility for the abortion. 
The woman ultimately traveled to a Chicago hospital to obtain an abortion. 
“She traveled five hours away from her child, away from her partner, away from her home to receive care that we could have safely provided down the hall but was illegal at the time,” Jackson said.
Anti-abortion lawmakers and advocates have for several months argued Amendment 3 eliminated women’s ability to sue providers if something went wrong during an abortion. Attorneys behind the abortion-rights amendment have said this is false. 
Asked about this, Jackson said under Amendment 3, providers must still meet professional licensing requirements through the Missouri Board of Healing Arts. She is also still required to carry medical malpractice insurance.
After Amendment 3 passed, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state, challenging several of Missouri’s laws focused on abortion facilities and providers. The proposed ban, if passed, would reinstate several of these targeted regulations on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, that were recently struck down as unconstitutional by a Missouri judge.
Amy DeClue, a surgical nurse from Franklin County, testified in support of the legislation, recounting stories of a few women she cared for in the hospital after they underwent abortions. 
“One in particular I’ll never forget because when she showed up, you could tell she was just mentally drained. She was alone, she was afraid, and she was just very sad,” DeClue said. “She couldn’t quit bleeding and they had left products of conception in her.” 
 ‘A culture of life’

Among those testifying against the legislation were women who sought out abortions decades ago in Missouri, when the procedure remained much more accessible, and pastors who said they speak often with congregants about the intersection of faith and health care. 
The Rev. Teresa Danieley, a priest in the Episcopal Church, said she disagreed with Seitz’s assertions that Missouri has a culture of life, noting the lack of mandatory paid parental leave, the state’s ongoing child care crisis and the current attempt by lawmakers to overturn the state’s voter-approved paid sick leave law. 
Danieley, who wore a button that read “Jesus never shamed a woman,” said she has helped counsel many religious women about their abortions. 
“Over and over again I hear these deeply religious women ask, ‘can God forgive me? Am I going to hell?’” she said. “I try to ground them in that they made the best decision they could given that there is no culture of life in this state or in this country.” 

The committee adjourned less than two hours into testimony. Of the people crowded into the hearing room and hallway, only six were there to speak in support of the legislation. State Sen. Patty, a Kansas City Democrat, noted that after her GOP colleagues again said that Missourians only approved Amendment 3 because they didn’t understand what they were voting on. 
“Missouri Right to Life represents hundreds of thousands of people across Missouri,” Klein said.  
“Where are they?” Lewis asked.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.

In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
‘It’s the system that needs fixing’
Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version focused on the science of reading passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill into law Monday to outlaw three-cueing.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”

Sen. Kemp’s bill requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
Opposition to ‘science of reading’
Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.



A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

At least two new Afghans and several hundred asylum seekers from Venezuela, Haiti and Ukraine who resettled in Vermont were set to lose their legal status this month due to recent federal orders.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerRecent efforts by President Donald Trump’s administration to revoke the legal status of refugees has alarmed Vermont service providers.It’s definitely affecting Vermont residents from certain countries, including Haiti, Ukraine and Venezuela, said Tracy Dolan, director of the State Refugee Office.“They’re nervous and they’re afraid for their safety if they ever have to go back,” she said.While new to Vermont, “they are doing all the things they’re supposed to be doing. They are working. They have employment authorization,” Dolan said. “Their employers generally have been pleased with the work and are really glad to have them.”Those impacted include residents in the U.S. on temporary protected status granted to those who came from certain countries experiencing crises — such as Afghanistan, Sudan and Ukraine — and the humanitarian parole program that allows people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to enter and stay in the country for two years.In light of February notices issued by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem revoking those programs, at least two Afghans and several asylum seekers from Venezuela, Haiti and Ukraine who resettled in Vermont were set to lose their legal status this month, officials said.The orders, which affected an estimated 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians nationwide according to the American Civil Liberties Union, have been challenged in court. A federal judge in San Francisco and another in Massachusetts have since ruled that those already in the U.S. could keep their protections for now. Alerts this month on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website state that Homeland Security “has every intention of ending Venezuela (temporary protected status) as soon as it obtains relief from the court order” and “No new requests for (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela) parole will be processed.”A hundred days into the Trump administration, the efforts amplify the president’s first-day promise to crack down on an “invasion” of migrants, based allegedly on the high numbers of asylum seekers arriving at the border. A previous order froze federal funding for refugee support affecting local relocation agency efforts.“These actions by the Trump administration signal to Vermonters and Americans that this country is no longer a nation of immigrants,” said Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, a Burlington-based nonprofit that supports Afghans who are resettling in the state.In Vermont, the orders affect dozens of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans and more than 100 Ukrainians who are “very concerned that they could lose parole, be denied the opportunity to renew parole, or have their (temporary protected status) reversed,” said Matt Thompson, a program manager for refugee services with the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants in Vermont, a nongovernmental, not-for-profit international organization that helps resettle refugees and advocates for their rights.While Thompson does not know of any Afghan residents affected by the latest order, the committee and its legal services partners have been working to ensure that Afghans in Vermont pursue other options for remaining in the U.S., he said, such as the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa or asylum.The effort to revoke protections launched by former President Joe Biden is problematic not just from a humanitarian standpoint but from an economic one, said refugee relocation workers.“These individuals have worked here, attend church — which for some is so important — and learn English. They want to work hard, do a good job and continue to contribute to the community,” said Yvonne Lodico, executive director of the Grace Initiative Global, a nonprofit based in Manchester that provides services to several refugee groups including Haitians and Afghans living in Vermont.The organization often fields calls from employers looking to hire newcomers, “and we have to decline,” she said. “Vermont companies, especially those in service industries, need these individuals.”The federal orders have caused anxiety and bewilderment among the refugee communities, Lodico said, particularly because they arrived through legal mechanisms after intense vetting.“They anticipated that through application for legal documentation they would be able to live and work here,” she said.Dolan said refugees have long contributed to the state economy. “I can’t speak for every person but in general all these populations are working,” she said.Ending temporary protected status for Afghans is particularly crushing for Afghan allies who have sought protection in the U.S. while the security situation continues to deteriorate in their home country under the Taliban, said Gray, from the Afghan Alliance.“They were made refugees because of their association with the United States government and support for U.S. military and diplomatic missions. It is these circumstances that make the revocation of (temporary protected status) that much more shameful, horrific and unconscionable,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Shameful, horrific and unconscionable’: Federal efforts to revoke legal refugee status could affect hundreds in Vermont, advocates say.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/afghans-2-20240812.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

There’s a lot of concern from different advocacy and service groups at the moment as Republicans in Congress have floated proposals for cutting hundreds of billions of dollars to Medicaid which funds services and care for individuals who have low incomes or disabilities.
Medicaid is not a line item easily crossed out without grave repercussions, Smith said. Medicaid often means the difference between a mother going to a postpartum check-up appointment to determine if she needs medical attention, or not going to that check-up appointment, Smith said, adding that those appointments provide access to prenatal vitamins, lactation support and birth in a hospital.
“For Black and brown moms who are already navigating higher risk and barriers, Medicaid often makes the difference between life and death, and that’s not hyperbole. That’s reality,” Smith said.

National data reflects that Black women are more than twice as likely to die from pregancy-related causes than their white counterparts and Michigan state data reflects the same reality where Black mothers were nearly three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as white mothers.
In order to comply with the spending plans and priorities of President Donald Trump’s administration, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, which regulates Medicaid amongst other governernment programs, is currently looking at how to save $880 billion, with Medicaid on the chopping block.
For the last decade, typically more than 40% of births in Michigan have been funded, at least in-part, through Medicaid programs, according to reporting from the Michigan League for Public Policy.
Medicaid provides care to those most vulnerable in Michigan, who might not have access to quality housing, nutrition or prenatal or postnatal educational resources, Smith said.

“So when that funding is cut, we’re not pulling access, we’re pulling care from the very families that need it most. We’re making it harder to close the gap and easier for preventable tragedies to continue,” Smith said. “I’m asking you to stay loud, call your lawmakers, share your stories and fight for your families, because every parent deserves to be helped. Every child deserves to be born into a system that’s ready to care for them, not cut them loose.”

As the approximately 100 attendees headed off to seek out state lawmakers to urge preservation of Medicaid-funded services, Aisha Wells, deputy director of organizing for Mothering Justice, which sponsored the rally, told the Michigan Advance that she hopes state lawmakers in the predominately white Legislature remember their districts all have moms and people of color and residents who rely on Medicaid.
As the mother of a teenage son and baby boy, Wells said she remembers not being listened to as a Black woman during her first pregnancy, dealing with doctors who shut down her concerns, but later determined her oldest son had obstructive congenital hydrocephalus which impacts the brain.
And though mothers of color in the Michigan state Legislature like Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) and Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) are leading the charge in combating adverse health outcomes for moms of color, Wells said, all lawmakers should be fighting to preserve health care for families in their district.
“Everybody in your community is important. They matter. If one of us is being harmed, we’re all being harmed,” Wells said.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/ct-surplus-windfall/,"CT is headed for its second-largest surplus ever, but it's unclear if officials will tap the $2.3 billion windfall to cover federal aid cuts.","Surging income and business tax receipts will leave Connecticut with its second-largest surplus in state history, analysts reported Wednesday, even as officials remained divided whether to use any of the $2.3 billion windfall to mitigate big cuts in federal aid.
And while the consensus revenue report from Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration and the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis showed a modest softening of revenues in the future, analysts still anticipate Connecticut will save an average of almost $1.3 billion in each of the next two fiscal years.
“Connecticut’s current fiscal year outlook remains positive,” Lamont said Wednesday, before quickly adding, “there are troubling signs” for the near future.
Despite the latest surge, the sales tax — Connecticut’s second-largest revenue engine after the income tax — is beginning to sputter. Analysts had expected the sales tax, which will produce $5.1 billion this fiscal year, to generate $127 million more in 2025-26, and $256 million more by 2026-27. Now they say there will be no growth next fiscal year, and only $127 million more two years from now.
Similarly, the corporation tax was expected to generate $1.56 billion this fiscal year for the state and then climb to almost $1.6 billion by 2026-27. Now analysts have downgraded expectations for this fiscal year’s receipts by $85 million, and that level largely will remain flat for the next two years.
“The economic policies coming out of Washington are directly impacting our state’s economic future, as evidenced by leading indicators such as consumer confidence,” the governor added. “Over the coming weeks, I will be working with legislative leaders to pass an honestly balanced budget that protects Connecticut’s core values, provides flexibility for inevitable federal cuts, and adheres to our statutory and constitutional budget obligations.”
Will Lamont spare some of CT’s windfall to offset cuts in federal aid?
A controversial budget cap that bars legislators from spending a portion of income and business tax receipts will capture $1.9 billion this fiscal year, according to analysts who had been projecting $1.4 billion in savings before the report was issued. 
That $1.9 billion, combined with the $384 million operating surplus the administration projected this week, would leave Connecticut with an unspent cushion equal to 10% of the General Fund. The projected $2.3 billion combined surplus is topped only by 2021-22, when Connecticut finished $4.3 billion in the black, an outlier driven by the arrival of billions in new federal pandemic aid. 
Critics of the budget caps say the system is far too aggressive and that much of the reported “surplus” is revenue badly needed for education, human services, municipal aid and other core programs.
And with three-quarters of the General Fund tied to fixed or largely fixed costs, including contractually pledged wages, Medicaid, debt service and payments toward pensions and other retirement benefits, removing 10% from the remaining quarter budget has a big impact.
Majority Democrats in the House and Senate have pushed for the past two years to scale back these savings efforts. Lamont, a fiscal moderate, largely has resisted. But he conceded in February that some change should be made and proposed reducing mandatory savings modestly by about $300 million per year starting July 1.
But the governor and his fellow Democrats are farther apart on how to use this fiscal year’s windfall when it comes to the threat of impending cuts in federal aid.
With Congress aiming to reduce Medicaid and other programs by as much as $880 billion over the next decade, Lamont has said some models show Connecticut losing as much as $880 million in annual Medicaid assistance alone. Federal officials also are eyeing cutbacks in assistance for K-12 education, public colleges and universities, and other health care programs that could cost the state and its municipalities hundreds of millions in additional yearly assistance.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, both appealed to Lamont recently to carve out a portion of this fiscal year’s surplus to mitigate likely losses from Washington. The state has a $4.1 billion rainy day fund equal to 18% of the General Fund, but Democratic leaders say much of that could be spent in the next two years if the national slips into a severe recession.
“Four billion dollars,” Ritter said earlier this month, “could go so quickly that people’s heads will explode.”
And Looney has noted that, traditionally, Washington responds to an economic downturn by increasing aid to states. If there is a slump and a contraction in federal aid, the double-whammy would be unprecedented.
The Democratic-controlled Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee last week approved a measure that would set $700 million of the surplus aside to mitigate cuts in federal aid.
Progressive groups also are urging the governor to ease Connecticut’s savings efforts to preserve programs here.
“We would join the Governor in celebrating a 10% budget surplus if our schools were fully funded, housing and healthcare were affordable, and our public services were fully staffed,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations. “Instead, we are facing unprecedented federal funding threats while working families continue to pay more for less.”
Lamont has been reluctant to commit anything more than the rainy day fund to solve all challenges facing Connecticut’s finances. He prefers to use the projected surplus to continue whittling down the state’s considerable pension debt, which topped $35 billion entering this fiscal year. Pension burdens, created by inadequate funding between 1939 and 2010, are projected to continue to strain state finances well into the 2040s.
“Our fiscal house has been rebuilt to weather an economic downturn,” said Jeffrey Beckham, the governor’s budget director. “Now is not the time to tear it down.”
Lamont also has support from minority Republicans in the House and Senate, who oppose any reduction in savings efforts.
“The [state budget] caps that we have in place have well positioned us for what may or may not happen at the federal level,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who added that excessive spending ordered by the Democratic state legislators are behind weakening consumer and business confidence in Connecticut. 
“These numbers should have the Democrats looking in the mirror,” he added.
“What this report shows is that, without question, the fiscal guardrails that Republicans fought to implement and preserve are working,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield and Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, ranking GOP senator on the finance committee, wrote in a joint statement Wednesday. “They are saving taxpayers billions and protecting against economic fluctuations. They have helped to control state government spending. They are paying down on the state’s debt.”
But Ritter and Looney both were hopeful Wednesday a compromise could be reached, at least between majority Democrats and Lamont.
The surplus is large enough, Democratic leaders said, to set aside funds to offset federal aid cuts; make a large payment to shrink pension debt; and adopt Lamont’s February plan to take $300 million from this year’s windfall to expand child care services. 
“We’re fortunate to be in a position to do that,” Looney said.
“I do think [the rising surplus] makes budget negotiations even easier,” Ritter added.

Sharice Davids of Kansas says GOP budget bill is ""not just reckless, it is cruel"" because it harms the working class for benefit of billionaires.","U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, characterized a House transportation committee budget bill as both cruel and reckless. She urged colleagues to work on bipartisan legislation that tackled wasteful spending without placing tax breaks for billionaires ahead of children, seniors and veterans. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. House YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas denounced Wednesday as reckless the budget proposal offered by Republicans on the House transportation and infrastructure committee.
Davids, who serves on the committee along with GOP U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann of Kansas, said the blueprint went beyond the goal of identifying wasteful government spending and amounted to a “direct attack on the people that we are here to serve.”
“I have always said I will work with anyone — Republican or Democrat — when it’s good for Kansans,” Davids said. “And, while it might seem difficult right now, I know and I believe that there is still room for common ground. But this partisan budget plan that we’re talking about today? It’s not just reckless. It is cruel.”
“We can improve government efficiency. We can reduce waste, fraud and abuse. But what we shouldn’t do is rush through chaotic policies that will raise costs for hard-working Kansans,” she said.
Davids, the lone Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, said President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress were “pushing massive tax giveaways for billionaires instead of offering real help to the folks who need it most.”
The president seeks extension of 2017 federal tax cuts that would increase federal deficits by approximately $4 trillion during the coming decade.
“In recent months,” Davids said, “we have all seen the chaos, and simply put, we’re exhausted. This is not how the federal government should work. The dysfunction isn’t just noise — it’s hitting people where it hurts. What we’ve seen from the administration and in this budget is not strategic. It’s reckless.”
In a statement, Mann said the objective of the transportation and infrastructure committee was to add detail to a House budget package that bolstered Trump’s border and national security agenda, shelved energy policies advanced by President Joe Biden and addressed wasteful spending. This slice of the budget should also allow for investment in modernizing the nation’s air traffic control system, he said.
“Later this week, the House will vote to repeal more Biden-era rules and regulations that harm American consumers,” Mann said. “America needs an all-of-the-above energy strategy — not a one-size-fits-California mandate.”
During the House committee’s deliberations Wednesday, GOP leadership’s recommendation to set a federal vehicle registration tax was amended in wake of bipartisan opposition. Originally, the legislation required U.S. owners of an electric vehicle to pay $200 annually, owners of a hybrid vehicle to pay $100 annually and owners of other vehicles to pay $20 annually to support federal highway programs.
It was amended by the committee to set the tax on electric vehicles at $250 per year, leave the hybrid vehicle assessment at $100 annually and eliminate the proposed fee on other vehicles.
The federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has generated insufficient revenue for the highway trust fund as engines became more efficient and battery-powered vehicle sales escalated. The federal gas tax hasn’t been adjusted for inflation since the mid-1990s.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sharice-Davids-budget.png,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

(Facility photo via Google Earth; inset photo courtesy of the Jacobs family)  An alleged whistleblower who says she was fired from a nursing home after being instructed to “keep your mouth shut” about a resident’s death is suing her former employer.
Tylene Schultz is suing the Fonda Specialty Care nursing home, its parent company, Care Initiatives, and licensed practical nurse Becky Manning in Pocahontas County District Court.
In her lawsuit, Schultz claims that in the summer of 2022, she was hired at Fonda Specialty Care by its then-administrator, Jennifer Blair, to work in the home as a certified nursing assistant.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
On Feb. 18, 2023, the home allegedly scheduled a temp-agency nurse, Manning, to work the overnight shift due to a shortage of staff nurses. During the shift, a resident with a tracheostomy passed away about 2:25 a.m., the lawsuit claims.
State records indicate the resident who died was 87-year-old Marvin “Pete” Jacobs, who had undergone a tracheostomy and needed regular suctioning of his airway. The lawsuit claims Jacobs died because throughout the shift, Manning refused to numerous requests to suction Jacobs’ airway.
“Despite multiple requests by Schultz to suction the resident — over 10 times, from 6 p.m. on Feb.18, 2023, to 2:25 a.m., Feb.19, 2023 — Manning would not suction the resident, nor did she attempt to use the suction machine,” the lawsuit claims.
Schultz alleges she tried to call “supervisory level staff” who worked for the home, but none of the individuals answered the calls. She also alleges she asked that someone call 911, but Manning told her no physician was available at that hour to provide an order for a hospital evaluation.
An ‘agonizing and painful’ death alleged 
In her lawsuit, Schultz alleges she and another CNA remained with Jacobs as he “pointed to his neck, coughed, gagged, struggled to breathe, and turned colors from the lack of oxygen, until he finally passed away. From Schultz’s direct observation of the resident, his death was agonizing and painful.”
Schultz alleges she and a fellow CNA were so traumatized by the death they had to excuse themselves from the facility and were standing outside the building in an “emotionally hysterical” state. The other CNA was “physically ill, to the point of vomiting,” when an ambulance crew arrived to confirm Jacobs’ death.
According to the lawsuit, after Schultz left the home at the end of her shift, she received multiple text messages from Blair that said, “Keep your mouth shut and keep your opinions to yourself,” along with instructions that she should not communicate with Jacobs’ family.
Later that day, Schultz was summoned to a meeting with Blair at Fonda Specialty Care. During the meeting, the lawsuit claims, Blair — who was allegedly was aware Schultz planned to call state regulators and report her concerns with Jacobs’ care — informed Schultz she was being fired due to “resident complaints.”
The lawsuit claims Blair also stated that Schultz had violated patient privacy provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act by calling a co-worker at home and asking for their assistance with Jacobs’ situation.
Schultz alleges she reported her concerns with Manning’s “actions and inactions” to both the Iowa Long-Term Care Ombudsman’s Office and the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing.
DIAL subsequently cited Fonda Specialty Care for “failing to ensure that a resident who needs respiratory care, including tracheostomy care and tracheal suctioning, is provided such care,” and fined the home $10,000. The penalty was then reduced 35%, to $6,500, due to the lack of an appeal in the case.
Manning was criminally charged with felony wanton neglect of a resident of a health care facility and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor wanton neglect. Last year, Manning entered into an agreement with the Iowa Board of Nursing in which she agreed to indefinitely suspend her practice of nursing.
In her lawsuit, Schultz alleges she was “fired for making a complaint to the ombudsman and the Iowa Department of Inspection of Appeals due to the suspected abuse and/or neglect of the resident … and not based on any resident complaints.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for wrongful termination. Care Initiatives has denied any wrongdoing and alleges that Schultz’s dismissal was based on legitimate, non-discriminatory, and non-retaliatory business reasons.
Inspectors detail events surrounding death
Some of the allegations in the lawsuit parallel the findings of state inspectors whose public reports describe the events leading up to Jacobs’ death.
According to the inspectors, an aide reported that Jacobs was sitting in his recliner when another worker noticed he appeared to be “in trouble” and instructed her to get a nurse right away. Jacobs was pointing at his neck, gasping for air, and mouthing that he could not breathe, the aide told inspectors.
The aide said she left the room to get the nurse and was absent for a few minutes. The worker who remained in the room later told inspectors Jacobs grew “really pale” and was gasping, so she, too, left the room and approached a nurse and said, “Would you please suction him? He needs to be suctioned.”
When the nurse entered the room, Jacobs was pale, but soon turned purple and then blue, the aide later reported. The nurse took his vital signs and told the aide Jacobs was having a heart attack. The aide explained to the nurse that Jacobs had been signaling he couldn’t breathe, at which point the nurse said, “Just a minute,” and left the room. The suctioning machine used to clear Jacobs’ airway sat idle on a nearby dresser, inspectors reported.
The nurse, later identified as Manning, told inspectors the “staff wanted me to suction him (and) I told the staff no. I was told that I would not have to do anything with the tracheostomy.” Manning allegedly told inspectors she first left the room to get supplies so she could check Jacobs’ blood pressure, pulse and oxygen levels and that when she returned, he was clammy and had an irregular pulse.
“I told the staff that I needed to go back to the nurses’ station and find out if the resident was a full code or DNR,” Manning reportedly told inspectors, referring to do-not-resuscitate orders that some residents have in place.
The inspectors allege that Manning told them that while she was checking on DNR order,  one of the aides approached her and said she was needed right away in Jacobs’ room. “I went back into his room and he had no blood pressure, no pulse, and no respirations. I pronounced him deceased,” she allegedly told inspectors.
She reportedly acknowledged her fellow workers had each told her Jacobs needed his airway suctioned and that he had been pointing to his neck and mouthing that he couldn’t breathe. According to the inspectors, Manning said that despite her colleagues’ comments, it never occurred to her to suction Jacobs’ airway.
Arbitration agreement blocks family’s lawsuit
Jacobs’ death is the focus of a separate lawsuit filed by his family against Fonda Specialty Care, Care Initiatives, Manning and the nursing home’s then-assistant director of nursing, Amanda Meyer.
According to the family’s lawsuit, when Manning arrived for work at the home on the afternoon of Feb. 18, 2023, she became aware Jacobs had a tracheostomy that would require suctioning at some point during the night and allegedly told Meyer and others she was unwilling or incapable of performing the work. Meyer allegedly told Manning to “watch a video and figure it out” and left the facility for the day, the lawsuit claims.
After the death, the family’s lawsuit claims, Manning falsely informed Jacobs’ son, Scott, that his father “went quickly and peacefully.” Scott Jacobs only learned of what actually transpired after being contacted by an Iowa Capital Dispatch reporter, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit alleges that after speaking to the reporter, Scott Jacobs called Jennifer Blair of Care Initiatives “to confront her about the (state’s) investigation and true facts of Pete Jacobs’ death.” According to the lawsuit, Blair “admitted to withholding information” from the family and not informing them of the state’s investigation and its findings.
Technically, the family’s lawsuit remains active, but all activity in the case has been stayed due to a judge’s finding that when Marvin Jacobs was admitted to the home, his son reviewed for 34 seconds an agreement that requires disputes over resident care to be settled through arbitration rather than the courts and then signed the document.
“The admittedly brief time he spent going over and eventually signing the arbitration agreement does not affect its validity or enforceability,” District Court Judge Michael D. Huppert ruled. Last week, the Iowa Supreme Court declined to review Huppert’s ruling.

House Bill 121, sponsored by Rep. Roy Daryl Adams, D-Jackson, would limit both trades from  saying they provide insurance claim services. The legislation also prohibits public adjusters from performing construction work in connection with the claims they handle. 
Adams’ bill cleared the House in a 96-0 vote Tuesday without debate. His proposal is one of dozens filed, with the backing of insurance companies, that seek to lower homeowner’s policy premiums in the state.
The measure, as amended on the House floor, would prohibit residential construction contractors from advertising or soliciting work as “insurance claims specialists,” a term that sometimes appears in their advertisements. 
In an April 23 hearing of the House Committee on Insurance, Adams said he hopes his measure will stop contractors from going door-to-door after storms to talk homeowners into filing insurance claims for roof work.
The original version of the bill would have prohibited roofing contractors from assisting customers with their homeowner insurance claims. It also would have ended the use of contingency contracts, in which roofers agree to perform work only if the homeowner’s insurance company approves their claim. 
Roofers could be banned from helping customers with insurance claims

However, several roofers who testified against that iteration of the bill raised concerns that it could make it illegal to provide many of their routine services, such as communicating with insurance companies. Some customers want help dealing with their insurance companies and look to contractors to provide second opinions on an insurance company’s damage assessments, Josh Lovell with Gator Roofing in Baton Rouge told lawmakers. 
Lovell told the committee he would be afraid to even say the word “insurance” in the presence of a customer if Adams’ bill became law. 
Some lawmakers have argued the proposal is necessary to prevent contractors from doing the work of public adjusters, who are independent claims assessors policyholders can hire for a fee to represent their interests. They are distinct from adjusters who work on behalf of insurance companies. 
After hearing roofers’ concerns, Adams amended his bill to remove many of its restrictions and applied the prohibitions specifically to advertising and soliciting. At the same time, the amendment expanded the measure to apply to all residential contractors — not just roofers. 
When asked about the proposal Tuesday, Louisiana Home Builders Association lobbyist Michelle Shirley said her organization has taken a neutral position on Adams’ bill.
The other goal of the legislation is to prevent conflicts of interest for public adjusters who are also residential contractors. It would prohibit them from doing any kind work related to the insurance claims they handle. In short, they would no longer be able to adjust an insurance claim and then pay themselves to do the repair work for that claim. 
Adams’ proposal is now pending in the Senate.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers advanced an amended proposal Wednesday to slow annual increases to Nebraska’s minimum wage down to a fixed rate, rather than using the inflationary bumps that voters approved in 2022.
Legislative Bill 258, from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, advanced 33-16 with a “compromise” from State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney setting annual increases to the state minimum wage at 1.75%. Voters in 2022 approved permanent cost-of-living increases each Jan. 1, starting in 2027, based on a calculation of inflation for the Midwest region from the prior August.

Nebraska’s minimum wage will rise to $15 on Jan. 1 regardless of LB 258.
LB 258 would increase the state’s training wage for teen workers and limit it to workers aged 16 to 19 at 75% of the state minimum wage this September, rather than 75% of the federal wage (which is $7.25 and hasn’t changed since 2009). That wage can be paid for up to the first 90 days of employment.
As a result, workers aged 14 or 15 would get a new youth minimum wage beginning at $13.50 next January and increasing every five years by 1.5%. The training wage would rise by 1.5% each year. 
Under LB 258, the new youth wage would not get above $15 until 2065, according to a Nebraska Examiner analysis.



LB 258 heads to a third and final round of debate. It advanced again with Raybould, a Democrat, joining 32 of 33 Republicans to advance the bill. State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, a Republican, again opposed the measure.
‘Certainty’ is amendment’s goal
Raybould said her bill provides predictability and that Clouse’s suggestion was a “reasonable compromise.”
Average inflation for the past five years, as provided under the voter-approved language, was 4.18%, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Midwest. Over the past 10 years, it was 2.63%. And over the past 25 years, it was 2.39%. 
Of those 25 years, inflation was less than 1.75% a total of 11 times. The Midwest region faced deflation twice, in 2009 and 2015.
Clouse said the amended LB 258 would give wage earners and businesses “certainty,” rather than “rolling the dice” on whether there would be a wage adjustment.

State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln again led opposition to the measure she said would “undercut the will of the people” and prevent hard working Nebraskans, particularly those who would be subject to the new “youth minimum wage,” from fully realizing the “intent” of voters just a few years ago.
Conrad said the “heart” of the debate is economic justice and that senators needed to “see the poor” who help keep the economy abuzz and “not look down our nose at them.”
“This isn’t a few kids working for bubble gum,” Conrad said. “These are our neighbors who deserve us to hear them and see them, to provide them with an opportunity to keep their head above water.”
‘Improve your outlook’
State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney, who supported Raybould’s measure, said lawmakers and workers faced a “never-ending chase” between mandated cost increases on businesses and increased prices on consumers. He predicted more lost jobs and automation.

Strommen also is lead sponsor of a bill amended into LB 415, from State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, to weaken paid sick leave protections that voters approved just last fall.
“We’re never going to be satisfied,” Strommen said of the minimum wage cycle. “We have to come up with a better way to handle this.”
State Sens. Mike Moser of Columbus and Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area said that if workers wanted a higher wage, they needed to work for it.
Moser said the debate surrounded “class warfare” when he said the minimum wage was not a “living” wage. Kauth said it was a “safeguard against people being abused too much.”
“If you’re struggling in your family, do your best to get a different job, get an education,” Moser said. “See what you can do to improve your outlook.”
Kauth agreed, adding: “Change yourself rather than asking the government to do it for you.”
A ‘setback,’ not a ‘stepping stone’
State Sens. Dan Quick of Grand Island and Ashlei Spivey of Omaha said that inflation affected all Nebraskans and that the best way to support youths is to invest in them and their families.

State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha said Raybould’s bill was a “setback,” not a “stepping stone” to getting more young workers hired, as Raybould has suggested.
Fredrickson said young people aren’t working just for a “slush fund” or “extra cash” but instead work to help with household expenses, college savings, gas, food and to “make ends meet.”
“We cannot tell them that their efforts are less valuable or that fairness and equality of wages can wait another year until they’re a year older,” said Fredrickson, asking if industry-specific wages were next.
State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue said that when he was young, and before he went into the U.S. Air Force, he saved wages he earned as a teen to help his mother, including from a low-wage construction job.
“I put a lot of money up in the left back corner of my top drawer in the dresser,” Rountree said, telling his mom that if she ever needed it, it was there.


Minimum wage types

Federal minimum wage: Created in 1938, now $7.25.
Nebraska minimum wage: Created in 1967, now $13.50.
Nebraska tipped employees minimum wage: Created in 1970, now $2.13. Wages plus gratuities must equal or exceed the Nebraska minimum wage under state law.
Nebraska training wage: Created in 1991, now $5.44 (75% of the federal minimum wage) for up to the first 90 days of employment for a worker younger than 20 years old.
Nebraska student-learners minimum wage: Created in 1987, now $11.25 (75% of the Nebraska minimum wage) for workers who are part of a vocational training program.
Nebraska youth minimum wage: Does not currently exist.



‘Will of the voters’
Much of the debate surrounded the “will of the voters” that opponents said Raybould and supporters of the changes were undercutting.
“If we pass this bill, we are telling Nebraskans that their vote only counts when it’s convenient for us,” said State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha. “That’s not a democracy. It’s not a public service, and it’s not the role of a citizen’s Legislature.”
State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse said that was flat wrong and that supporters were “free and well within our authority” to amend the language, so long as they had at least 33 votes under the Nebraska Constitution.
“I guess if you say things long enough, you might begin to believe it yourself,” Hallstrom said. “Maybe some other people will believe you, but that doesn’t make it any more true.”
This round of debate was less personal than the first for Raybould, a longtime grocery store executive whose family owns and operates Super Saver and Russ’s Market. Raybould continues to serve as vice chair of the company’s board. She filed a conflict of interest statement on LB 258.
The change came in part because Raybould urged lawmakers Wednesday to move away from “personal attacks.”
“Even when it’s couched with words like ‘my dear friend,’ it gives permission for others to direct their anger and their hatred toward that person, and that can have very unfortunate consequences,” Raybould said, citing recent political violence in Pennsylvania.
A call back to 2007
During the debate, Raybould and Hallstrom walked through LB 31 of 2007, from Conrad during her first year as a lawmaker. As introduced, Conrad’s bill, her first in 11 years of legislative service so far, would have increased the minimum wage over time for all workers 17 years old or older, while younger workers would have been subject to the federal minimum wage.
Hallstrom, as a paid lobbyist 18 years ago, opposed LB 31.
Raybould asked Hallstrom if the Conrad of 2025 would have supported LB 31 of 2007, which Raybould and Hallstrom said seemed an odd position.
“I don’t think I’m qualified to speculate or define as to what now Senator Conrad, formerly Senator Nantkes, might have done differently,” Hallstrom said. “What I do know is that I do not criticize her for having a change of heart or a change of mind on the issue.”
A version of Conrad’s bill passed later in 2007, in line with federal minimum wage bumps. Conrad helped lead the successful 2014 ballot initiative that raised the state wage.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha called out the “tone deafness” of LB 258’s debate, such as the exchange on the floor of the Legislature between Raybould and Hallstrom, a former paid lobbyist, being used as justification for the measure’s necessity.
Conrad said the heart of her work has always been to put more money in people’s pockets.
“If you’d like to ask me about my intentions,” Conrad responded, “I’m happy to yield for questions so that other senators don’t have to guess as to my intentions from 15 years ago.”



Eligibility for the Nebraska, federal minimum wage
The federal minimum wage did not apply to most workers until 1978:

In October 1938, the wage went into effect for employees engaged in interstate commerce or in producing goods for interstate commerce.
Beginning September 1961, at a slightly lower rate than interstate commerce employees, the wage extended to workers of large retail or service enterprises, as well as those in local transit, construction or gas stations.
By February 1967, state or local government employees in hospitals, nursing homes and schools, as well as workers in laundries, dry cleaners and large hotels, motels, restaurants or farms were covered. Between 1970 and 1978, farm workers were paid at a lower rate.
Beginning January 1978, the federal minimum wage extended to most nonexempt workers at one minimum wage, $2.65 at the time.

Nebraska created a state minimum wage in 1967, applying in that case to workers not covered by the federal minimum wage until 1978. The Nebraska minimum wage has now surpassed the federal minimum wage and must be paid to all workers in businesses employing four or more employees. For smaller businesses, the federal minimum wage must be paid.

That’s despite the state Senate voting last week to remove state Treasurer Curtis Loftis from office for his role in a $1.8 billion accounting blunder. The error involved almost no actual money but went unreported for nearly a decade.
House Democrat calls for SC treasurer’s impeachment over $1.8B accounting debacle

But as the clock runs out on the 2025 legislative session, House GOP leaders said their chamber won’t take the matter up this year.
“We’re going to concentrate on passing legislation now, and then we’ll make a decision after session concludes on the path forward with the treasurer,” House Speaker Murrell Smith told South Carolina Public Radio in an interview that aired Wednesday.
In the House on Wednesday, Republicans shut down a last-ditch effort by a House Democrat to initiate impeachment proceedings on the state’s banker.
Rep. Heather Bauer, D-Columbia, rose from her seat to ask her colleagues to take up the bill she introduced in January and start the process. The request required unanimous approval by the chamber.
But Rep. Bill Taylor, R-Aiken, quickly objected, halting the attempt without further explanation.
Just four days remain in the 2025 legislative calendar. By state law, the regular session must end at 5 p.m. May 8.
In the Public Radio interview, Smith said the House has not totally ruled out taking action, but work remains on what that process might look like.
“This is the busiest time of the legislative session and so we’re going to have to get through our legislative business,” the Sumter Republican said.
Meanwhile, Loftis has said he plans to run in 2026 for a fifth term in office.
“I am ready to turn my focus back to doing the people’s work — to stabilize our state’s financial system and put this unfortunate chapter of fighting baseless claims by a few politically-motivated senators behind us,” the Republican treasurer wrote in a late Tuesday statement.
SC Senate votes to remove state treasurer over $1.8B accounting error

Loftis stands accused of “willful neglect” of his duties after he and other financial officials failed to alert the General Assembly of the accounting issues in the state’s books. The Senate voted 33 to 8 for his removal.
The error in question stemmed from the changeover from the state’s legacy accounting system to a new one.
During that process, a series of electronic ledger entries made it appear the state had $1.8 billion sitting untouched in a fund with no record of where it was supposed to go.
A forensic accounting firm hired by the state ultimately found the entries were made in error, and all but $200 million of the money was never real. Their work cost taxpayers $3 million.
Loftis has continuously said he did nothing wrong, as no money went missing, and has instead laid the blame for the problem outside his office.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Curtis-Loftis-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

Two consecutive committee chairs getting overruled by their committee members signifies a growing rift among California Democrats about how to address the housing crisis.


One of the most controversial housing bills of the year has lived to be voted upon another day, but only by surviving the Legislative equivalent of two back-to-back prison breaks. 
Last week, Senate Bill 79, a bill by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener to boost apartment and commercial construction around major public transportation hubs, passed the Senate Housing Committee over the strenuous objections of its chair, Sen. Aisha Wahab, a fellow Democrat from Fremont.
That was a notable development in its own right. Chairs tend to get their way on the bills that pass through their committees. When a majority of a committee’s members decide to buck legislative decorum and tradition and steamroll that committee’s chair, it’s often taken as a sign that California’s dominant Democrats are unusually divided over an issue; that the issue at hand is especially contentious; that the legislators either aren’t receiving clear guidance from legislative leadership or are willing to ignore that advice; or some combination of all of the above.
Fast forward to this week and it happened again. 
In the Senate Local Government Committee, Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Los Angeles Democrat, urged a no vote on Wiener’s bill. 
She didn’t get her way. The bill passed with the backing of all the other Democrats on the committee. Durazo voted “no” with the two Republicans.
A chair getting “rolled” is an unusual spectacle in Sacramento. In the typically arcane and perfunctory proceedings of the Legislature, this bit of human drama pops up once or twice a year. For it to happen twice in a row for the same bill is without any obvious precedent. 
“Extra unique” is how Chris Micheli, a longtime California lobbyist and public commentator on the Legislative process, described the situation. “Beyond the particular bill at hand, it could give an indication that there is a philosophical split in the caucus.”
So far Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Santa Rosa Democrat, has refused to comment publicly on where he stands on the divide within his caucus, whether the two chairs speak for him and whether he plans to intervene to smooth things over.
For some advocates, like Jim Wunderman, president of the Bay Area Council, which co-sponsored SB 79, the silence from McGuire has been deafening. 
“Close watchers of the legislative process have taken note of the differences between the two houses’ treatment of the housing topic this week…The Assembly seems to recognize the urgency of this moment,” Wunderman wrote to McGuire late last week, referencing another major housing bill that easily passed an Assembly committee last week.  “As ‘one of our own,’ a member of the Bay Area Caucus, and President Pro Tem of the Senate we feel compelled to write to you to share our deepening concern that the progress that we need on housing may ultimately stall in the Senate.”
McGuire’s office did not respond to a request for interview before this story was published.
After the caucus, Wiener downplayed the idea that there are irreparable divisions within the party.
“You have two chairs who have just a different perspective and that’s normal and, you know, I appreciate that we’ve been able to go through this process very respectfully,” he said. “We’re all grown ups.”
As for McGuire: “He’ll weigh in when he needs to weigh in,” said Wiener. 
McGuire is termed out of the Legislature next year, an expiration date which may limit his influence.
The increasingly public philosophical split within the Democratic caucus was apparent in both committee hearings. Wiener is a prolific housing legislator whose views align with the broader “Yes In My Backyard” movement that sees California’s housing affordability crisis as the product of an overall housing shortage. For that group, which includes Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Assembly Appropriations Committee Chair Buffy Wicks, making it easier to build more homes more cheaply, quickly and densely is the policy north star. Wicks said as much at a recent legislative hearing. 
“’I’m like a one-trick pony,” she said during a debate over a statewide rent control bill. “We’ve got to make it easier to build more housing in California and that has been really my sole focus since I’ve been here.”
Wahab and Durazo represent a different faction of the Democratic Party. Both have stressed that they aren’t opposed to new housing construction and that they share the view that the state faces a severe housing shortage. But they are more skeptical of the private development that tends to be a byproduct of the YIMBY movement’s proposed legislation, and believe state law that encourages it should come with terms and conditions. 
Wiener’s bill would allow housing developers to build apartment, condo and mixed-use towers on or near train, subway and light rail stations, ferry terminals and at the intersection of heavily used bus lines, regardless of what local zoning or building design rules specify. It would also remove barriers to transit agencies that want to do the same on their own land. 
“If we leave decisions about what to build up to market-rate developers who do not have the broader public interest in their minds, it’s the wrong way to go,” Durazo said. “While I want to help members move their legislation forward, sometimes bills go against our core values and amendments won’t address that.”
“We are aligned on the vast majority of issues,” Wiener said in response. “In this one, unfortunately, we are deeply not aligned and I do not believe that building more housing near public transportation, housing of every variety, goes against our core values.”

The bill doesn’t require private developers to set aside a share of units for low-income residents. Last week, Wahab called the lack of an explicit affordable housing requirement a “sweetheart deal” for the housing industry. Some affordable housing and anti-gentrification activists have turned out to oppose the bill, arguing that expanding opportunities for private development would come at the expense of affordable housing opportunity and turbocharge displacement.
The bulk of studies that have looked into the question have found that new market-rate housing reduces neighborhood rents and tends to ease displacement pressures.
Wiener has stressed that apartments and condos are inherently more affordable than single family housing and that the bill would not preclude other state and local affordability requirements that developers might be subject to from applying. In the committee hearing today, Wiener said that he is “exploring the possibility” of including a minimum affordability requirement.
The bill is also opposed by many local governments and neighborhood groups that resent the state’s usurpation of their land use authority and opponents of dense development. Ditto the State Building and Construction Trades Council, an umbrella group representing many unionized construction workers, who regularly oppose housing bills that lack stringent labor standards, and some environmental justice advocates.
Another Wiener bill, Senate Bill 607, which would make it easier for urban multifamily housing projects to avoid environmental review — a priority of many Assembly Democrats — also survived, despite Durazo’s “no” vote.
Both bills are now scheduled to go to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
This latest legislative kerfuffle could be a sign of things to come. This year, Assembly Democrats have put forward a vast package of housing bills aimed at speeding up development. Though some are eye-glazingly technical, others may incite the same Dem-on-Dem infighting that broke out over Wiener’s bill.
“(SB 79) could foreshadow tough sledding for some of the Assembly bills,” said Micheli.

Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, listens to a filibuster over a bill to overhaul sex education and make public schools teach “sexual risk avoidance” and abstinence on April 29, 2025 in Montgomery, Alabama. (Alander Rocha/ Alabama Reflector)A bill seeking to make Alabama’s public schools teach “sexual risk avoidance” and abstinence likely won’t become law this year.
A Democratic filibuster over the General Fund budget Tuesday pushed debate over SB 277, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, to the last couple of minutes before midnight, when the legislative day ends. The late debate meant senators could not vote on the measure. 
Shelnutt made his unhappiness at the prospect clear.
“We’ve only got 10 more minutes. Y’all wasted the whole day. So, let’s just waste the last 10 minutes. I know you want to waste the last 10 minutes,” Shelnutt said at around 11:50 p.m. when Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, asked if he would be willing to delay the bill until next year to allow them to work on something together.
There are four days left in the 2025 session of the Alabama Legislature. Starting on Thursday, bills originating in the Senate that have not yet passed that chamber need unanimous consent to be sent to the House. A single senator’s objection can kill a bill.

“Senator?” Figures asked after a few seconds, following a question about whether he had been in contact with the Department of Education to learn about the current sex education curriculum.
“You’ve read the bill. You know what the bill does. There’s no sense wasting my time answering your questions. Y’all want to stop it, so just you got the mic. Go,” Shelnutt responded defensively.
“Senator, I am sincerely asking you questions about this bill,” Figures responded.
Shelnutt remained defensive during the debate, maintaining that “this is a good bill” and that he didn’t want “teachers, left-wing, crazy people, teaching my kids about stuff that I don’t ever want them to hear about.”
“If you got a problem with it, you got a problem with it,” Shelnutt said to Democratic senators.
The bill would change sex education programs to include information about the “financial cost of pregnancy and child care, abortion, and adoption,” as well as “instruction about parenting responsibilities.”  It explicitly prohibited “providing a referral to or information about how to acquire an abortion,” “misrepresenting the efficacy of or demonstrating the use of contraceptives,” and “using images that are sexually explicit.”
“I don’t want my kids taught that crap. I mean, it’s crap,” Shelnutt said on the floor.
The bill also tried to prevent local boards of education from using services from any individual or organization “that does not endorse sexual risk avoidance or that advocates for or performs abortions.”  It also mandated that parents or guardians be given a 14-day notice before any sex education instruction and granted them the right to opt their children out of such programs.   
Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, spoke briefly after Figures and pushed back on the claim that Tuesday was a “wasted day.” Instead, he said, it was an opportunity to compromise.
“It’s only a waste when you don’t care about things that we’re trying to address for the people that we represent. So, if I’m categorized as trying to represent the people that I represent, and someone wants to call it a waste, then so be it,” Smitherman said.

Ramirez defeated Republican Bernie Hayes on Tuesday for the seat representing parts of Cedar Rapids with 79% of the vote, according to results from the Iowa Secretary of State’s website.
Speaking with the Iowa Capital Dispatch Wednesday, Ramirez said the significant margin of victory in the special election is because Iowans do not appreciate actions taken by both the Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress, as well as Iowa’s GOP trifecta at the state Capitol.
“I believe that through the election, it’s been clear that our communities believe that progress isn’t partisan, and that they believe in a mission to stand up and deliver for Iowans,” Ramirez said. “And given the context of this federal administration and what this state administration has been doing, I think the fact that our community showed up for this campaign is even more of a stance — that they do not want to put up with what’s been going on on a state and federal level, that they harshly disagree with it, and they are ready for something new.”
Ramirez is a community organizer who serves as the co-founder and executive director of Our Future, a nonprofit fellowship program focused on youth leadership and climate activism. Ramirez also works as a Youth Peace Project Facilitator for Kids First Law Center, an organization providing free or low-cost legal representation for children in custody and divorce proceedings. She is the first Latina elected to the Iowa Legislature. The first Latino elected was Rep. Mark Cisneros, R-Muscatine, in 2020.
While the nearly 80% win for Ramirez represents a strong showing for Democrats in the state, it is not a flipped seat victory like Sen. Mike Zimmer’s win in January in a special election to replace Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer in the Senate. The House District 78 seat was formerly held by Scheetz, a Democrat, who resigned April 1 to serve on the Linn County Board of Supervisors. In the 2024 general election, Scheetz won reelection in an uncontested race.
There has been one other Iowa special election in 2025 — Republican Blaine Watkins won a tight victory against Democrat Nannette Griffin in a March 11 race to fill the House District 100 seat after Rep. Martin Graber, R-Fort Madison, passed away in January because of a sudden heart attack.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart released a statement celebrating Ramirez’s win, saying the victory still shows the strength of Iowa Democrats heading into 2026 and future elections.
“I’d like to thank Ramirez for her readiness to represent her constituents, and to stand up for the rights and prosperity of all Iowans,” Hart said. “The scale of our victory tonight shows that as long as Democrats run candidates who understand and fight for their communities, we can win elections across the state. There’s more work to be done, but tonight we can rest assured that things are looking a little brighter. We won this election in good shape. Tomorrow we get ready for the next.”
Republicans have maintained their trifecta of control after the special elections, holding 67-33 in the House and 34-16 in the Senate.
When she gets to Des Moines, Ramirez said she plans to advocate for protecting low-income and other marginalized communities, funding public education, while pushing back on state GOP policies that she said are “giving tax cuts to corporations and big ag.” Ramirez also attributed her election success in part to Iowans’ frustrations with Republicans, who she said are focusing on divisive cultural issues instead of the financial and community struggles many people currently face.
“People are tired of the anger and the division and sort of the performative outreach that dominates our state administration right now, with the Republican-led Legislature and governor,” Ramirez said. “So our community believes that we can do better, and that’s been clear throughout different special elections, but especially this last one with me as the candidate.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Facetune_04-09-2022-00-56-03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) The North Dakota University System says it is reviewing records for violations of policy or law related to sex crimes committed by former state lawmaker Ray Holmberg. 
State Board of Higher Education Chair Tim Mihalick read a statement at the start of Wednesday’s board meeting that said members learned at the same time as the public “that individuals previously affiliated with our institutions or board, may have had a connection to the criminal investigation of former Sen. Holmberg.”
A review began immediately, he said.

The board also has urged anyone with information about a university system employee or board member who failed to report misconduct to file a report to the institution’s Title IX office or the university system’s Office of Compliance and Ethics.
Holmberg represented Grand Forks, home to the University of North Dakota, in the Legislature for 45 years before resigning his seat as an investigation was underway. Holmberg, 81, was sentenced in March to 10 years in prison for traveling to Europe with the intent to pay for sex with underage boys. 
Holmberg served on the Legislature’s interim Higher Education Committee for several years, including as past chair. As chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Holmberg held a key position to make funding decisions that affect state universities. He also served on the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. 
A former University of North Dakota graduate student who became a cooperating witness in the case against Holmberg spoke at the sentencing hearing about Holmberg’s abuse of power.
UND President Andrew Armacost on Tuesday sent a letter to the UND community addressing recent media reports about Holmberg and investigative documents released Friday.
“What I read sickened me, both in the criminal actions of Holmberg and in the inaction of those who had direct information about his misdeeds,” Armacost wrote.
Armacost acknowledged the documents mention several former UND employees connected to Holmberg.

“While they have not been accused of criminal action, we will ensure that they have no connection to our university community,” Armacost wrote. “Furthermore, we have shared our concerns with external organizations that interface with UND to make certain these people no longer represent these organizations.”
Investigation documents released Friday showed Holmberg sent emails about his visits to Prague in the Czech Republic to Bruce Gjovig, CEO of the University of North Dakota’s Center of Innovation in Grand Forks. 
“What think of my twink?” Holmberg asked Gjovig in one 2011 email, using a slang term that refers to young, slim men.
“Too young for me, but thanks,” Gjovig replied.
“No one is ever to young… remember Prague,” Holmberg wrote back.
Gjovig’s lawyer, Cash Aaland, said in a statement that Gjovig was not aware of Holmberg’s crimes and believed his comments to be exaggerated “locker room talk.” Gjovig retired from UND in 2017 and no longer has an official role with the university, said university spokesperson David Dodds.
Holmberg in 2016 emailed a former state senator, Nick Hacker, about a sexual encounter he had with someone in Taiwan. At the time the email was sent, Hacker was a member of the State Board of Higher Education. Hacker said the email was unsolicited and that he did not reply. Hacker said he provided the message to the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation in 2022.
Jim Poolman, a former legislator from Grand Forks and state insurance commissioner, this week issued a public statement after social media posts linked him to Holmberg.
“Holmberg’s behavior is indefensible, awful, and beyond comprehension. I never received any communications, electronic or otherwise, that would indicate that he was conducting himself in such a manner. He did not talk about his horrible crimes to me,” Poolman wrote.
Poolman said that about 19 months ago, he was interviewed by Homeland Security about Holmberg. He said he fully cooperated with investigators and answered all their questions.
“Since then, I have heard nothing from federal law enforcement because I was not involved, knew nothing of his heinous activities and have done nothing illegal,” Poolman wrote.
North Dakota Dems push for new mandatory reporting laws in response to Holmberg emails

Poolman announced Tuesday that he was resigning as chair of the UND Alumni Association and Foundation board of directors and from the Forever UND fundraising campaign committee. 
His written statement said the resignation “is in the best interest” of UND. 
“There are so many great things going on at UND and the last thing there needs to be is a distraction. I do not want to be that distraction,” Poolman wrote.
On Wednesday, Poolman declined to comment beyond his statements.
Armacost started as president at UND in June 2020, about two years before Holmberg resigned from office. 
Armacost in his letter to campus also provided a list of resources to those who have been impacted by Holmberg or have experienced trauma unrelated to this case
“If you witness such behaviors, please report them, and we will respond quickly to any allegations of abuse or mistreatment,” Armacost wrote. 
When asked earlier this week if UND planned to investigate whether employees knew about criminal activity, a UND spokesperson said, “If a report is filed with the university, it would be investigated.”
In his message to campus, Armacost said, “The university will take action based upon facts from authoritative sources.”

Kevin Stitt speaks outside the U.S. Supreme Court building Wednesday after the Court heard oral arguments Wednesday over the constitutionality of a religious charter school seeking to open in Oklahoma. (Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)WASHINGTON, D.C. — A seemingly divided U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday over the nation’s first religious charter school that aims to open in Oklahoma, putting the constitutionality of a state-funded Catholic education to the test.
An Oklahoma state board approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.
The nation’s highest Court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.
Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the Court is expected by the end of June.
The Court’s liberal justices — Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson — appeared doubtful that previous rulings support the idea that a charter school could constitutionally adopt a religion. Kagan also wondered about the nationwide implications of permitting publicly funded religious schools.
Kavanaugh, part of the Court’s conservative majority, said disapproving a charter school solely on religious grounds “seems like rank discrimination against religion.” Opening charter school funding to faith-based institutions would “be expanding the options, not contracting the options” of school choice in public education, he said.
“All the religious school is saying is, ‘Don’t exclude us based on religion,’” Kavanaugh said.
Jackson and Kagan, though, pointed to ways St. Isidore’s founding contract differs from that of other charter schools. The school pledged to comply with state regulations and non-discrimination laws only to the extent that Catholic doctrine allows.
The Court made prior decisions that religious schools can’t be excluded from government grants and state-funded tuition assistance programs. In those cases, Jackson said, a religious school wasn’t changing the terms of a government program.
“It seems to me you are not seeking the same public benefit as everyone else,” Jackson said.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.

“We are grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court heard our case and now entrust it to their wisdom,” Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley and Tulsa Bishop David A. Konderla said in a statement Wednesday. “Of course, we pray and hope for a decision that stands with religious liberty and the rights of Oklahoma families to make their own decisions in selecting the best educational options for their children.”
Both the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. Oklahoma’s attorney general has led the legal battle against the school.
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore.
Both contended charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.

After leaving the courtroom, Campbell said he found the justices “very receptive to the arguments we were making.”
“The law is on our side,” Campbell said. “The First Amendment says when you create a program and invite everyone in but tell only religious groups that they can’t come, that violates the Constitution.”
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
Charter schools bear all necessary resemblance to traditional school districts to be considered public, Garre said. The state can open and close a charter school, unlike a fully private institution. They are subject to the equal academic standards as Oklahoma public schools and most of the same regulations, though they have more flexibility over teaching methods and employee hiring.
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Laws in 47 states, including Oklahoma, and federal law all define charter schools as public schools and forbid them from religious affiliation.
Like all public schools, Garre said, charter schools must comply with church-state separation.
Kagan seemed to agree.
“When I look at Oklahoma and its charter schools program, they look like regular public schools,” she said. “These charter schools, except for some things on the margin, are equivalent to public schools. So why shouldn’t we take the state at its word (that they are public)?”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state.
Drummond contended St. Isidore would create a “slippery slope” leading to charter schools teaching faith systems that most Oklahomans would disagree with — a position Alito said “seems to be based on hostility to certain religions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt has been a vocal advocate of opening St. Isidore. Standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Stitt said the school “expands choice and freedom,”  and the government shouldn’t stand in the way.
“I think the Supreme Court is going to rule with us because it’s just common sense,” he said.
  National Alliance of Public Charter Schools President and CEO Starlee Coleman, front, said a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of a Catholic charter school could upend programs across the country. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Charter school advocates feared a ruling in St. Isidore’s favor could cause a widespread closure of charter programs in states that won’t abide taxpayer-funded religious education.
All of a sudden, “we won’t know what the rules are for charter schools anymore in 47 states and the federal level,” said Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.
“This is going to shut down the charter school program in many states where there is simply no appetite by state lawmakers to fund religious schools,” Coleman said after oral arguments. “States like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois where there are millions of children attending charter schools today.”

(Courtesy of Smith Entertainment Group)The Utah Hockey Club wrapped its first season in a temporarily modified Delta Center this year. Now, Smith Entertainment Group, which owns the state’s NHL franchise, unveiled how it would remodel the arena to permanently accommodate hockey and basketball.
One of the main events in the transformation is the implementation of a retractable seating system in the arena’s lower bowl “that accommodates a nearly 12-foot variance in elevation between rink and court endlines to offer optimal sightlines for both the NBA and NHL,” according to a news release. It’s a first of its kind in a dual-use arena, Smith Entertainment Group said of the feature. 
With the hockey configuration, there will also be added capacity behind the goals and above and around the event tunnels on the north and south side of the lower bowl. For basketball, the riser system will have 29 rows of retractable seats that are able to extend over 28 feet.

Ryan and Ashley Smith, co-founders of Smith Entertainment group, said in a statement that while adding an ice rink inside an arena designed to host basketball is challenging — since the rink must be nearly double the size of a basketball court — they are excited to get started on the challenge. 
“This transformation will create the most compelling, welcoming, and exciting experience for hockey fans, while also allowing us to maintain the steep vertical seating for basketball that has made Delta Center such a dynamic venue with its loud atmosphere that energizes our players night after night,” the Smiths said. 

With these renovations, the Delta Center is expected to increase its seating capacity from 11,131 to about 17,000 for hockey, and from 18,206 seats to nearly 19,000 for the Utah Jazz. 
This is a major part of what SB272, a 2024 bill that created a sports and entertainment district in Salt Lake City’s downtown, intended. The legislation allowed the city to start collecting a 0.5% sales tax increase for 30 years to raise about $900 million for the arena’s renovations as well as redevelopment for three blocks of the neighborhood. 
SLC Council approves sales tax increase proposal for sports and entertainment district

Smith Entertainment Group estimates that $525 million will be used on the remodel of the Delta Center and $375 million will go to cover costs to develop the district. While the deal with the state and the city includes a participation agreement in which the company committed to fund programs and spaces for the public, Salt Lakers remained divided on whether taxpayer dollars should be used for this endeavor. 
Ultimately, the city signed onto the agreement. And, after the 2025 legislative session, the state created more tools to fund renovations to the Salt Palace Convention Center, also a landmark of the downtown district. 
On Tuesday, the Salt Lake County Council voted unanimously to approve selling 6.5 acres of county-owned property — between South Temple and 100 South, and 200 and 300 West — to Smith Entertainment Group.

The area hosts an exhibit hall space at the convention center and it’s surrounded by the Delta Center, Japantown, Abravanell Hall, the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art and City Creek Center, according to a release.
“This is more than a land transaction — it’s a catalyst for long-term growth, a stronger downtown, and significant benefits to residents across Salt Lake County,” Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson said in a statement. “The redevelopment of this property will generate millions in tax revenue, attract major national and international events, and ensure Salt Lake City remains a premier destination for sports, entertainment, cultural events and tourism.”
Construction starts this summer for the Delta Center remodel, but it will take multiple years to complete, with work being done during the summer when the teams are off-season. The plans also include an east-side entrance to connect with the downtown district, and a new parking garage at the back of the arena.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota ranks 46th in the nation for average teacher salaries — its highest standing since the National Education Association started ranking states in 1943, according to the South Dakota Education Association.
The state previously reached 47th in the 2019 report for the 2017-18 school year, after South Dakota lawmakers approved a half-cent sales tax increase in 2016. The effort poured millions of dollars into school districts with the intent of raising average teacher salaries.
The state fell to 50th by the 2021 report and ranked 49th in last year’s report.
South Dakota saw one of the greatest jumps in standing this year compared to other states, due to a 6% increase in salaries. During the 2022-23 school year, South Dakota’s average teacher salary stood at $53,153. In the 2023-24 school year, the average teacher made $56,328.


South Dakota Education Association President Loren Paul attributes that to increases in state aid to public education from state lawmakers. Legislators approved a 6% increase in 2022, 7% in 2023 and 4% in 2024. Those infusions were largely due to an influx of federal COVID-19 relief funds into the state budget.
Lawmakers also established a minimum teacher salary for districts and tied teacher compensation requirements to state aid increases during the 2024 legislative session. Both were “strong accountability measures” resulting in “meaningful gains,” Paul said in a news release.
Lawmakers approved a 1.25% increase in education funding this legislative session. The slight increase was approved due to lower-than-anticipated revenue and because COVID funding has run out.
Paul warns the slight increase could cause teacher pay to fall further behind inflation. Adjusted for inflation, South Dakota teachers make less than they did a decade ago.
“While we see moving up in rank as good news, we are concerned that lawmakers will take their feet off the gas and salary increases will stall, forcing many teachers to leave the profession because they can’t pay their bills,” Paul said.
Compared to neighboring states, South Dakota’s average teacher pay of $56,328 remains the lowest this year:

North Dakota: $58,581.
Minnesota: $72,430.
Iowa: $62,399.
Nebraska: $60,239.
Wyoming: $63,669.
Montana: $57,556.

States that rank lower than South Dakota are Louisiana, West Virginia, Missouri, Florida and Mississippi (there are 51 spots in the rankings, due to the inclusion of Washington, D.C.). Mississippi’s average teacher salary of $53,704 is the nation’s lowest, according to the report, just a 0.7% increase compared to the previous year’s salary.
California reports the highest average salary at $101,084 — a 6.2% increase from last year. Oklahoma saw the largest percent change in its salaries at 10.5%, increasing to 35th ($61,330) from 43rd in the rankings.
South Dakota’s ranking for average starting salary improved to 25th in the nation, at $45,530, which is up from 27th in last year’s report.

(Courtesy image)Two candidates have filed to be considered for New Mexico’s next lieutenant governor in the 2026 elections.
Current Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard — who is term-limited in that position — is running as a Democrat while Manuel Lardizabal, a former candidate for the New Mexico Senate, will seek the Republican nomination, according to state candidate filings.
In the November general elections, the governor and lieutenant governor run on the same ticket, but each office has separate party primaries in June. The lieutenant governor has both executive and legislative roles. Lieutenant governors are second-in-command and stand in for  governors during their absences. The lieutenant governor also serves as president of the New Mexico State Senate, overseeing the body’s business during the legislative session and determining issues of decorum or rules.
The lieutenant governor holds a tie-breaker vote, according to the state Constitution, but only in the Senate.
Garcia Richard announced her bid in March. She told Source NM this week that the pending federal cuts to New Mexico spurred her to run, noting the high percentage of New Mexicans on Medicaid, along with the state’s reliance on federal funds for special education. She said she hopes to enhance the office’s ombudsman role.
“We need to be leaning on statewide leaders to be showing the way for New Mexico in this time, pushing back on the federal government when it’s required, making sure New Mexicans are protected from federal threats,” she said.
Garcia Richard said she was inspired by former Democratic Lt. Gov. Diane Denish’s role on the children’s cabinet and the way current Democratic Lt. Gov. Howie Morales managed unemployment requests during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The office really can be a powerhouse for constituent services,” she said. “I’m really running to make the office more responsive and as an agent for positive social change for New Mexicans.”
Two Democratic candidates have announced gubernatorial runs in 2026: Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman and former Congresswoman and U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland.
Garcia Richard, who served for three terms in the New Mexico House of Representatives, said she is on good terms with both of the announced candidates.
“I have great relationships with them,” she said. “I feel like my skill sets could really complement theirs, and I understand that success is relationship-dependent.”
According to the latest campaign filings, Garcia Richard has a $32,528 cash balance on hand, a combination she said of a transfer from her campaign for land commissioner and recent donations.
Only one candidate, Democrat Juan Sanchez, has jumped into the race for Garcia Richard’s land commission seat. Statewide candidates have until Feb. 2, 2026 to file.
Garcia Richard also noted that a $600 fine assessed for a late filing from the New Mexico Secretary of State’s office was due to a clerical error.
“I filed under my previous office,” she said, and then transferred the account.
When reached by phone, Lardizabal told Source NM he’s only submitted the initial filing paperwork and would announce his campaign launch and website soon. Lardizabal reported no expenditures or contributions so far.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-30 20:55:57+00:00,CT Mirror,CT bill that would clear path for lawsuits against gun industry passes House,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/ct-gun-civil-liability-bill/,The gun industry could face civil damages for the misuse of firearms in limited circumstances in Connecticut under the bill.,"The gun industry could face civil damages for the misuse of firearms in limited  circumstances in Connecticut under product liability legislation passed by the House and sent to the Senate on Wednesday.
Passage of House Bill 7042 came on a largely party-line vote of 100 to 46 in the House, where Democrats have a 102-49 majority. Five Democrats were opposed and five Republicans in favor.
Republican opponents decried the bill as unfairly holding gun makers and sellers responsible for the actions of purchasers, while the Democratic sponsor described it as a reasonable effort to make an industry be more attentive to public safety.
The state legislation follows a narrow path left open by a federal law that generally protects the gun industry from damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearms or ammunition.
Exceptions to the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act include cases where harms occurred after a manufacturer or seller knowingly violated a law applicable to the sale or marketing of guns.
Nine states have passed similar laws, said Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, the lead sponsor of the bill. 
 He said the same exception was used by families of nine Sandy Hook Elementary School families to sue Remington over its marketing of the AR-15 style rifle used to kill 20 students and six educators in 2012. They agreed to a $73 million settlement in 2022.
The U.S. Supreme Court had refused to hear an appeal of a Connecticut’s court decision that allowed the families to pursue the case.
The families sued under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. A key element of the lawsuit was a claim that Remington knowingly marketed the rifle to young, at-risk males in advertising and product placement. One the ads featured the rifle and the phrase: “Consider Your Man Card Reissued.”
The measure requires the firearms industry to establish and enforce “reasonable controls” preventing persons ineligible to purchase a gun from obtaining one through a straw purchase or other means.
“What this bill would do is provide a civil remedy or a civil cause of action for victims of violence, victims of gun crimes, victims of those who are harmed by irresponsible actions by gun manufacturers, gun dealers and gun sellers,” Stafstrom said. 
Stafstrom is a trial lawyer, co-chair of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee and a long-time ally of a gun safety movement influential in Connecticut since the Sandy Hook school shooting.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, dismissed the bill as a windfall for the personal-injury bar.
“This is probably a trial lawyer’s dream. I don’t think it does anything to make Connecticut residents safer from gun violence,” Candelora said. “It certainly will make lawyers a lot richer.”
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said, “We are saying to the firearm industry, ‘You’re going to be held to a different standard.’”
Gun dealers complained at a public hearing that the measure would threaten their businesses. 
Edward Rando, the owner of Ron’s Guns in East Lyme, said he feared the bill would make insurance unavailable or prohibitively expensive. In the last 40 years, he said, the annual cost of insurance quadrupled from $5,000 to $20,000.
The measure also would prohibit persons convicted of violent misdemeanors outside the state from obtaining a carry permit necessary to purchase firearms and ammunition in Connecticut. Current law only makes those misdemeanors disqualifying if they occurred in the state.
The five Democrats opposing the bill were Jill Barry of Glastonbury, Pat Boyd of Pomfret, Michael DiGiovancarlo of Waterbury, Chris Poulos of Southington, and Kerry Wood of Rocky Hill.
The five Republicans in favor were Chris Aniskovich of Clinton, Devin Carney of Old Saybrook, Tina Courpas of Greenwich, Tom Delnicki of South Windsor and Tracy Marra of Darien.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7389-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-30 17:10:27.495238

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Donald van der Vaart—the state’s former environment secretary and a climate skeptic who was shortlisted for EPA administrator during the first Trump administration—has been appointed to the North Carolina Utilities Commission by Republican Treasurer Brad Briner.
Van der Vaart started his career in state government as a 20-year employee in the Division of Air Quality and was promoted to secretary of the Department of Environmental Quality by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in 2015. He was a proponent of offshore drilling and fracking.
The Utilities Commission regulates the rates and services of utilities like Duke Energy and companies that provide gas, electricity and drinking water. In that role, the commission oversees the state’s transition to renewable energy and is also responsible for ensuring the safety of natural gas pipelines.

“North Carolinians need a strong voice on the North Carolina Utilities Commission,” Briner said in a press release. “Don provides that voice, and his expertise and leadership will ensure that the citizens of North Carolina have access to low-cost, reliable energy.”
The appointment still must be approved by the state House and Senate.
Many environmental advocates oppose the appointment. Dan Crawford, director of government relations for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, called van der Vaart’s appointment “short sighted and a violation of the public trust. This appointment flies in the face of science and clean energy progress. It’s like letting an arsonist guard the fire station.”


Van der Vaart would earn roughly $150,000 as a utilities commissioner.
“I am deeply honored by Treasurer Briner’s confidence in me,” van der Vaart said in the press release. “I look forward to working to ensure that North Carolina’s energy future remains reliable, affordable, and ever cleaner—safeguarding both our prosperity and our environment.”
The treasurer did not have appointment power to the Utilities Commission until December, when the state legislature passed Senate Bill 382. The measure was ostensibly a disaster relief bill for communities devastated by Hurricane Helene, but also contained unrelated provisions that conservative lawmakers favored.
Then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, vetoed the bill, but the Republican-controlled legislature overrode it.
Before SB 382, the governor appointed the majority of the Utilities Commission—three seats. After the bill became law, one of those appointments went to the state treasurer. The bill also shrunk the membership from seven to five, starting in July: two appointments by the governor, one by the state treasurer and one each to the House and Senate leadership. The treasurer and legislative leaders are all Republicans, meaning the GOP will have control of the new five-member commission.
Earlier this month Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat elected in November, petitioned a Wake County court for a temporary restraining order to thwart the treasurer’s appointment power, arguing it violates the state Constitution. The filing names House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger as defendants.
A spokesperson for the governor’s office told Inside Climate News that “the parties are currently trying to work out a briefing schedule to get this dispute resolved as expeditiously as possible so that the Governor can continue the work that voters elected him to do.”
When Cooper was elected governor in 2016, van der Vaart could have lost his job as a political appointee. Instead, van der Vaart used his statutory authority to demote himself to a middle management position in the Division of Air Quality.
He held that post for a year until he co-authored a lengthy opinion piece in a national environmental law journal calling for the elimination of a key air quality rule, an opinion that contradicted the stance of the agency.
Shortly after then-DEQ Secretary Michael Regan placed van der Vaart on administrative leave, he resigned.
When Donald Trump won election in 2016, van der Vaart wrote him a congratulatory letter that earned him consideration for EPA administrator. In part, the letter read: “We must put an end to the idea that more regulation is always good, and instead allow state and local experts to improve the environment.”
The top EPA post went instead to Scott Pruitt, who named van der Vaart to the EPA’s Science Advisory Board.
In a 2018 opinion piece for The Hill, van der Vaart wrote that some environmental groups were “serving as proxies for the Russians,” and to protect the environment Trump should investigate those allegations.
Van der Vaart returned to state government in 2019 when Berger, the State Senate leader, appointed him to the Environmental Management Commission. The EMC makes environmental rules that DEQ must follow.
His ascent continued when the chief justice of the state Supreme Court named him the chief administrative law judge for the Office of Administrative Hearings.

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)WASHINGTON, D.C. — A seemingly divided U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday over the nation’s first religious charter school that aims to open in Oklahoma, putting the constitutionality of a state-funded Catholic education to the test.
An Oklahoma state board approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.
The nation’s highest Court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.
Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the Court is expected by the end of June.
The Court’s liberal justices — Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson — appeared doubtful that previous rulings support the idea that a charter school could constitutionally adopt a religion. Kagan also wondered about the nationwide implications of permitting publicly funded religious schools.
Kavanaugh, part of the Court’s conservative majority, said disapproving a charter school solely on religious grounds “seems like rank discrimination against religion.” Opening charter school funding to faith-based institutions would “be expanding the options, not contracting the options” of school choice in public education, he said.
“All the religious school is saying is, ‘Don’t exclude us based on religion,’” Kavanaugh said.
Jackson and Kagan, though, pointed to ways St. Isidore’s founding contract differs from that of other charter schools. The school pledged to comply with state regulations and non-discrimination laws only to the extent that Catholic doctrine allows.
The Court made prior decisions that religious schools can’t be excluded from government grants and state-funded tuition assistance programs. In those cases, Jackson said, a religious school wasn’t changing the terms of a government program.
“It seems to me you are not seeking the same public benefit as everyone else,” Jackson said.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.

“We are grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court heard our case and now entrust it to their wisdom,” Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley and Tulsa Bishop David A. Konderla said in a statement Wednesday. “Of course, we pray and hope for a decision that stands with religious liberty and the rights of Oklahoma families to make their own decisions in selecting the best educational options for their children.”
Both the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. Oklahoma’s attorney general has led the legal battle against the school.
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore.
Both contended charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.

After leaving the courtroom, Campbell said he found the justices “very receptive to the arguments we were making.”
“The law is on our side,” Campbell said. “The First Amendment says when you create a program and invite everyone in but tell only religious groups that they can’t come, that violates the Constitution.”
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
Charter schools bear all necessary resemblance to traditional school districts to be considered public, Garre said. The state can open and close a charter school, unlike a fully private institution. They are subject to the equal academic standards as Oklahoma public schools and most of the same regulations, though they have more flexibility over teaching methods and employee hiring.
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Laws in 47 states, including Oklahoma, and federal law all define charter schools as public schools and forbid them from religious affiliation.
Like all public schools, Garre said, charter schools must comply with church-state separation.
Kagan seemed to agree.
“When I look at Oklahoma and its charter schools program, they look like regular public schools,” she said. “These charter schools, except for some things on the margin, are equivalent to public schools. So why shouldn’t we take the state at its word (that they are public)?”

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state.
Drummond contended St. Isidore would create a “slippery slope” leading to charter schools teaching faith systems that most Oklahomans would disagree with — a position Alito said “seems to be based on hostility to certain religions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt has been a vocal advocate of opening St. Isidore. Standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Stitt said the school “expands choice and freedom,”  and the government shouldn’t stand in the way.
“I think the Supreme Court is going to rule with us because it’s just common sense,” he said.
Charter school advocates feared a ruling in St. Isidore’s favor could cause a widespread closure of charter programs in states that won’t abide taxpayer-funded religious education.
All of a sudden, “we won’t know what the rules are for charter schools anymore in 47 states and the federal level,” said Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.
“This is going to shut down the charter school program in many states where there is simply no appetite by state lawmakers to fund religious schools,” Coleman said after oral arguments. “States like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois where there are millions of children attending charter schools today.”

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)New reports highlighted by the Kentucky Education Association show that pay for public school teachers in the state fell in national rankings again this year. 
The annual reports from the National Education Association, the national teachers union, examine teacher pay nationwide. This year, Kentucky ranks 42nd in the nation for average public school teacher pay at $58,325 despite a 3.6% increase from the previous year. Last year, the NEA ranked Kentucky as 41st in average teacher pay. 
The national average teacher salary is $72,030, according to the 2025 data. 
In a press release, KEA President Eddie Campbell said the organization “is deeply concerned about the General Assembly’s lack of investment in Kentucky educators’ pay.” 
“Every school district across the commonwealth faces shortages of teachers, substitutes, bus drivers, custodians and office staff nearly every day of the school year,” Campbell said. “Properly investing in our teachers’ pay could help remedy this critical shortage and make Kentucky a competitive destination for educators working in our neighboring states. Until then, Kentucky will continue to struggle with staffing our public schools.”
The NEA data also put Kentucky at 48th in the nation for average beginning teacher pay. According to the report, average starting teacher pay is $40,161 after a 2.4% increase over last year’s average. Kentucky ranked 45th in average beginning teacher pay in 2024. Additionally, Kentucky classified workers — such as bus drivers, janitorial workers, administrative staff and cafeteria employees — were found to make an average salary of $28,088 per year, ranking 49th in the  country even though the average salary increased 3.7% over last year. 
Salaries for public school employees has long been a political football in Kentucky. Throughout both of his terms, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has called for the Republican-controlled General Assembly to approve raises for public school employees, most recently during his State of the Commonwealth address in January. 
At the time, Beshear said that Kentucky voters’ rejection of a constitutional amendment to allow the state legislature to fund nonpublic schools last fall was “a mandate to prioritize public education.” 
However, days later at the annual Kentucky Chamber Day Dinner, Republican House Speaker David Osborne, of Prospect, said the state legislature had provided a historic level of K-12 education funding.
“These are the same people that have not provided one single, substantive, creative, thoughtful, intentional policy change to improve education,” Osborne said. “Because let’s be clear, asking for more money is not big. Asking for more money is not bold. Asking for more money is just an ask — and it’s not working.”During the 2023 gubernatorial election, then Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron released an education plan that called for raising the base rate pay of new Kentucky teachers to an annual salary of $41,500. Cameron, who ultimately lost to Beshear, is now campaigning for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1237957061.jpeg,,,2025-04-30 17:10:27.495238

(Mia Maldonado / Idaho Capital Sun)A federal judge has blocked parts of a new Idaho immigration enforcement law while she evaluates a lawsuit challenging the law.
The Idaho Legislature created the new law through House Bill 83, which was modeled after a controversial 2023 Texas law.
Idaho’s law creates the new immigration crimes of “illegal entry” and “illegal reentry,” targeting individuals who do not have proper immigration authorization and those who have already been deported from coming to Idaho. Law enforcement would only be able to convict someone of those crimes if they are suspected for a different crime.
The law took effect immediately after Gov. Brad Little signed the bill into law on March 27. But hours later, the judge blocked Idaho from enforcing the law through a temporary restraining order that she later extended in response to a lawsuit by ACLU of Idaho.
Federal judge Amanda Brailsford on Tuesday issued a longer lasting preliminary injunction, blocking Idaho from enforcing two new crimes created through the bill: illegal entry and illegal reentry. 
In her ruling, the judge wrote the ACLU of Idaho showed it was likely to succeed on the merits of several of its claims, including arguments that the new crimes created through the bill violate the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution, that the new crimes are preempted by federal law, and that the groups and five anonymous people ACLU represents in the lawsuit “are likely to suffer irreparable injury” under Idaho’s new law. 
“We are pleased the court recognized that enforcement of this law is harmful and unconstitutional,” ACLU of Idaho Staff Attorney Emily Croston said in a written statement. “We are confident this lawsuit will succeed on its merits, and we hope it sends a message to Idaho’s lawmakers that passing anti-immigrant, unconstitutional legislation is not what Idaho needs.”
Hours after the governor signed the bill, ACLU of Idaho sued Idaho officials over the new law, including Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador and county prosecuting attorneys. 
“The Attorney General’s Office is reviewing the decision to determine next steps. We will continue to defend House Bill 83 in full,” Idaho Office of the Attorney General spokesperson Damon Sidur told the Sun in a statement.
Idaho’s new law also creates the crime of “trafficking a dangerous illegal alien,” or knowingly transporting an unauthorized immigrant who has previously been convicted of a crime in the U.S. or another country. The law grants immunity to law enforcement officers, meaning they are protected from lawsuits that could arise from the damages and liability they cause while enforcing the law.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)On July 25, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a radio address to 125 million Americans in which he coined the term “first 100 days.” Today the 100th day of a presidency is considered as a benchmark to measure the early success or failure of a president.
Mr. Trump’s 100th day of office lands on April 30 where the world has witnessed his 139 executive orders, 39 proclamations, 36 memoranda, a few Cabinet meetings and numerous press briefings. In summary, Trump’s cabinet appointments, tariff-related flip-flopping and arbitrary, capricious and erratic actions have created 1929-like turmoil in the stock market, utter confusion among our 184 international trade partners and confounded unrest with consumers, workers, small business owners and corporate CEOs. Interestingly, an UMass/YouGov poll found that 26% of the people who voted for Trump have lost their confidence and appeal for our 47th president (April 17).
It appears The New York Times was the first media agency to report on just the 18th day of Trump’s 2.0 presidency that he was creating a constitutional crisis. That claim has been reported by multiple major news agencies, spoken in town-hall meetings and observed in thousands of public protests with demonstrators from all political persuasions requesting Congress and the Supreme Court to stop our democracy turning into an authoritarian dictatorship.
On March 25, I sent an e-mail to authoritarian scholar Barbara McQuade (Professor – Univ. Michigan Law School; U.S. Attorney Eastern Michigan – 2010-2017; author: “Attack from within: How disinformation is sabotaging America) seeking her expert opinion on what citizens would most likely witness when a constitutional crisis has occurred and recommended action citizens should take.
Two days later, McQuade replied to my inquiry: “1) If a president were to deliberately violate a court order, I think we could consider that a constitutional crisis. 2) Citizens can do many things to push back against abuse of power, such as vote, write to their member of Congress or participate in a protest, but I think the most effective thing a citizen can do is to talk to their friends and neighbors to explain their concerns and rally support.”
Peter Wehner, Republican, who served as the speechwriter for three GOP administrations (i.e., Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) and senior fellow at Trinity Forum — an American faith-based nonprofit Christian organization — feels Trump has created not one, not two, but three crisis situations. Wehner stated in an April 19-20 Wall Street Journal article “It seems as if we are moving at a rapid speed toward a genuine constitutional crisis, a genuine separation-of-powers crisis and a genuine checks-and-balances crisis.”
All citizens of Utah — regardless of their political preference — can decide if any of the following actions and published repercussions put Utah and her fellow Americans in a precarious dilemma:

Trump has openly defied federal court directives, refusing to halt deportation flights to El Salvador and return an illegally deported Maryland man.
Trump has eliminated and/or dismantled federal agencies — like USAID — by executive order, bypassing Congressional authority.
Trump has claimed the right to withhold or redirect federal funds appropriated by law, undermining Congress’s constitutional power of the purse.
Trump has fired civil service-protected employees, a violation of federal law.
Trump is attempting to end birthright citizenship by executive action, a constitutional right under the 14th Amendment.
Trump has withheld funds from universities without legal justification.
Trump has revoked visas solely because of the holders’ expressed viewpoints, violating First Amendment protections.
Trump has attacked federal judges, questioning their legitimacy and authority, which erodes the independence of the judiciary.
Trump has created DOGE without Congressional approval, challenging the separation of powers.
Trump has set tariffs on our trading partners as opposed to Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution that grants Congress the explicit power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises” and to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.”

Polling by the revered and non-political Reuters/Ispos found 83% of Americans feel “Trump must obey federal court rulings even if he doesn’t want to” (April 20). Wall Street Journal polling has shown, “voters want to keep constitutional guardrails in place that constrain a president’s power” (April 4).
Keep in mind, as of April 26 there have been 211 legal challenges to Trump administration actions (Just Security – New York Univ. School of Law). Additionally, a probable Trump-related contempt of court opinion was issued by U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg which, if ordered, could lead to incarceration (Law News, April 23).
If you are concerned about Mr. Trump’s endeavors, consider the advice offered by law professor Barbara McQuade: participate in peaceful rallies, support political candidates committed to upholding constitutional democracy, communicate with your two senators and representative about your concerns and visit with friends about the trifecta crisis that is becoming more evident by political scientists, authoritarian scholars, constitutional law experts and registered voters like you and me.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/trumpjan272025-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-30 17:10:27.495238

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers on Wednesday fought over whether educators should be able to physically discipline disabled students before ultimately voting to send a bill prohibiting the practice to the governor.
Senate Bill 364 prohibits school personnel from “hitting, paddling, spanking, slapping” or using any other physical force on a student with a federally recognized and protected disability. Existing state law only prohibits schools from administering corporal punishments on students with the “most significant cognitive disabilities.”
“It’s really sad, the broad links people will go to to try to twist and turn words to continue to allow people to slap, choke, pull hair, cause bruises, push, shove, and anything else that they can do to a kid with special needs,” said Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, the bill’s author .
He said only a small percentage of Oklahoma districts — around 60 that he knows of — still allow corporal punishment. But Moore quickly ticked off a list of disabled children who have been choked or paddled by school personnel without parental permission. Moore said he was not going to publicly name the districts.
Nothing in the measure prohibits parents from administering corporal punishment on their disabled children, but schools could not, he said.
“I don’t think a kid with Down syndrome should be spanked,” Moore said. “I don’t think a kid with epilepsy should be beaten. I don’t think a kid with autism should be choked.”
Moore said he’s a devout Christian, a deacon in his church, and administers corporal punishment on his own children. But he said it is appalling that people cite the Bible to justify choking a child with special needs.
“It makes me ashamed to be someone that might be categorized with that person,” he said
House lawmakers have previously garnered national attention for refusing to put such a ban into state law. Administering corporal punishment on disabled children has been banned by the State Department of Education since 2020. Federal records show hundreds of Oklahoma children with disabilities were physically disciplined during the 2020-21 school year. 
Rep. Jim Olsen, R-Roland, said the language of the bill passed Wednesday is nearly identical to the previous measure that failed to advance out of the same chamber about two years ago. 
Olsen said the prior one didn’t advance because of concerns that the number of protected students was too broad and because it stripped away parental power and local control.
Those concerns remain, he said.
There are certainly children who should never have corporal punishment used on them, but Senate Bill 364’s prohibition is too broad because in addition to protecting the profoundly disabled, it also includes students who suffer from hearing, speech and visibility impairments and serious emotional disturbances, Olsen said.
“If you had a 10-year-old boy that was physically healthy, intellectually normal, and he couldn’t say his R’s correctly, under the provisions of this bill, he would be prohibited, even if the parents wanted it, he would be prohibited from having corporal punishment used on him,” he said. “No exceptions.” 
He said the Bible references that the “rod and reproof gives wisdom, but a child left to himself brings his mother to shame.”
“I have observed over the years that when we get to thinking that we’re smarter than the Bible that doesn’t turn out very well,” he said.
Rep. Cynthia Roe, R-Lindsay, said it’s appalling that lawmakers are having to have a conversation about “inflicting suffering on a child that has no idea what is happening.”
She said multiple studies show that students with disabilities have corporal punishment applied at disproportionately higher rates than their non-disabled peers. Multiple child psychology organizations oppose “beating a kid in school,” and most experts recommend non-violent methods to address inappropriate behavior in school, Roe said.
Roe, who is also a child abuse examiner, said corporal punishment signals to a child that the way to settle conflict is by inflicting physical force and pain and that it’s OK to “just slug somebody in the face because you don’t agree with what they’re saying.”
She said lawmakers talk about protecting their children from predators, but are not protecting vulnerable children from punishments they can’t understand.
“They don’t realize that the behavior they’re exhibiting is not appropriate, and they’re not understanding that getting their butt beat is because of the behavior they just exhibited,” Roe said.
But Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, said lawmakers are stripping parents of the ability to permit the use of an effective discipline method that they know will “get my child’s attention.”
The bill also does nothing to change the fact that children who aren’t diagnosed with a disability can still be subjected to physical discipline in school, he said.
West said lawmakers should be looking at school corporal punishment usage in totality, not just one part. 
The bill leaves the door open for a broad interpretation, and West said he fears that if a school district does allow corporal punishment, there’s a “very, very strong chance that a parent could sue, even if they had given permission.”
The bill, which awaits a decision from Gov. Kevin Stitt, passed 61-23.

The protest was one of over 1,000 planned across the country. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Lawyers for the federal government rejected immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra’s claim that she is being detained and targeted for deportation because of her political speech, and once again asserted that the case is moving through the incorrect jurisdiction.
The government “had an objectively reasonable justification to arrest (Vizguerra) and detain her — namely, she is not lawfully present in the United States and is subject to a reinstated removal order,” an April 29 filing reads. “The presence of such valid reasons for the arrest and subsequent detention means that her First Amendment retaliation challenge fails.”
The new filing came in response to an amended petition from Vizguerra’s lawyers, which alleged that her March 17 detainment was retaliation for her criticism of the Trump administration and national prominence as an activist, and therefore violated her protected First Amendment rights. The judge in the case, U.S. District Court Judge Nina Wang, issued a temporary block on any deportation efforts for Vizguerra before the court could consider the legality of her detainment.
The case centers on a reinstated removal order from 2013 that Vizguerra’s lawyers say is invalid.
But the federal government argued in its filing that legal precedent shows that noncitizens cannot bring challenges to their removal based on claims of selective enforcement. Lawyers pointed to a 1999 case where eight members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed they were being unconstitutionally targeted for their political beliefs. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately decided that immigrants without legal status do not have the defense of selective prosecution, because that argument only delays deportation proceedings in response to the violation of immigration law.
“The Court reached this decision even after the government admitted ‘that the alleged First Amendment activity was the basis for selecting the individuals for adverse action,’” lawyers wrote. “Here, (Vizguerra) brings a similar challenge to that brought by the noncitizens in (the 1999 case). She argues that (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)’s actions in arresting, detaining, and executing a reinstatement of a removal order against her were improperly based on retaliation for her activism. But she acknowledges that she has no lawful status in the United States.”
The new filing also questions the evidence Vizguerra’s lawyers used to argue that her detainment is retaliatory. Those include various social media posts celebrating her arrest from ICE, a public affairs official for the Department of Homeland Security and former ICE official John Fabbricatore. The posts are distinct in tone from other arrest announcements from the agency on social media because they specifically allude to her activist background and outspoken criticism of the immigration system.
“But she has not presented evidence that either the individuals controlling ICE’s X account or the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs were involved in the decision to detain Petitioner. Accordingly, these posts do not show retaliatory motive,” the filing reads.
The government also asserted that the correct venue for the case would be in the Court of Appeals. A similar case was filed in the 10th Circuit, but has not seen movement.
In a different filing Tuesday, Vizguerra’s lawyers asked the court to clarify that the restraining order against her deportation also includes the so-called reasonable fear interview process. That is a part of removal proceedings where federal officials determine if deporting someone to their country of origin would put them at a serious risk of harm.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began that interview process shortly after Vizguerra’s detainment and have “repeatedly failed to notify counsel in advance of interview scheduling, have repeatedly attempted to proceed with the interview without counsel present, and in at least one instance falsely advised Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez that her attorney had consented to and insisted that the interview move forward without counsel,” lawyer Laura Lichter wrote.
On April 14, USCIS made a negative reasonable fear determination after nearly a month of interview attempts that Lichter said violated due process.
“It is clear that Respondents DHS and ICE are directing USCIS as their agent or otherwise working in active concert or participation with the agency in forcing the conclusion of the reasonable fear process to facilitate, enable, and advance a removal that is temporarily enjoined,” Lichter wrote.
A hearing for the case has not been scheduled.
Vizguerra has lived in the United States since 1997. She was arrested in 2009 for having a fake ID and driving without insurance and was placed in removal proceedings. An immigration judge offered her the option of voluntary departure in 2011, which Vizguerra appealed. She then left the country in 2012 to see her dying mother in Mexico and reentered the United States without authorization in 2013. She was ultimately sentenced to ICE supervision and has been granted multiple stays of removal since then, the last of which expired last year. She gained national attention when she sought sanctuary in Denver churches to avoid deportation during the first Trump administration and was recognized as one of the 100 most influential people by Time Magazine in 2017.

An outside investigation found that last year’s leak of the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s order accepting a case challenging the state’s 1849 abortion law was “likely deliberate,” but was unable to determine its source. 
Last June, Wisconsin Watch published a story detailing the contents of the Court’s draft order agreeing to hear Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin v. Urmanski, the lawsuit challenging the validity of the abortion law. After the leak, all seven members of the Court condemned the order’s release, and the investigation began in August. 
According to a report released Wednesday, investigators interviewed 62 people and reviewed computer records in an effort to find the leak’s source. Despite the inconclusive findings, the report includes a number of recommendations for improving the Supreme Court’s security. 
The draft order was written on June 13 and Wisconsin Watch published its report on June 26. Investigators interviewed the 28 people who had “immediate access” to the draft. They included the seven justices, judicial assistants, law clerks and Supreme Court commissioners, as well as 18 people whose key card data shows they entered the justices’ chambers during that time period, interns and other office staff. 
Investigators requested computer usage data to determine what websites office staff visited during that time frame. The report states, however, that computer usage data from June 13 to 25 is missing. 
“The lack of complete website visitation logs for the period between June 13, 2024 and June 26, 2024 significantly hampered the ability to thoroughly examine the circumstances surrounding the leak,” the report states. “The issue underscores the importance of proper data management, retention, and verification procedures especially when such information is crucial for ongoing investigations.”
No evidence was found during the investigation that would show the leak was caused by an external breach of the Court’s network, according to the report. 
But the report also states that justices and Court staff often send confidential information to the justices’ personal email accounts and leave confidential documents unattended in printer trays. Unauthorized individuals have at times been able to access restricted floors in the Court’s Madison offices, the investigators also found. 
To improve the Supreme Court’s security, the report recommends a number of policy changes. Those include establishing better protocols for the handling of paper copies of confidential documents; stopping the justices’ use of personal email accounts; improving retention of computer history data; and using digital watermarks on confidential documents to ensure “the document remains traceable throughout its lifecycle.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Wednesday sent Gov. Kevin Stitt a measure that would allow teachers to use unused sick days to extend their existing six-week maternity leave.
House Bill 1601 would allow educators to use up to six weeks of banked sick leave hours to extend their leave.
“Sick leave must be used for recovery from childbirth, bonding with a newborn, or caring for a newborn,” according to the measure.
It would not require approval from the school board or employer, according to the measure.
Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, is the senate author.
He said it wouldn’t cost the state anything.
Mann, a former member of the Oklahoma City Public Schools Board of Education, said he would like teachers to have up to 12 weeks of paid maternity leave.
“But with the budget outlook we have right now, that is not possible,” Mann said.
Some private companies have significantly more paid maternity leave days, he said.
“So, we’ve got to do something because these young mothers, when they have a baby, they want to spend more than six weeks,” Mann said. “And quite frankly, brain research shows us that they need to spend more than six weeks with that newborn.”
Mann said the measure will help recruit and retain teachers.
Six weeks isn’t a lot of time, but it is better than what the state had been doing, which was requiring new mothers to take unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, Mann said.
“I would like to see male staff have at least a month off when they have a newborn,” Mann said. “There are some other things we can do that are pro-family, pro-baby, but I think this is a good, good step in the right direction.”
Senate Education Committee Chairman Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said he supported the measure, but said lawmakers were making some decisions for schools in terms of staffing.
“I’ve heard many times that we’ll just trust school boards and superintendents to do the right thing,” Pugh said. “But I think if you’ve heard from your teachers on this issue, that is not happening uniformly across every district in the state of Oklahoma.”
The measure passed the Senate by a vote of 39-5.

A five-member board of appointees would manage the state’s $127 billion in investments under House Bill 506. And House Bill 92 would give that board the power to invest up to 5% of the state’s portfolio in cryptocurrency.
The measures represent a concentrated effort to shift the state’s approach to investing. North Carolina’s pension system has a $16 billion deficit, and the fund’s investments have yielded lower returns in comparison to other states’ portfolios in recent years.
State Treasurer Brad Briner, a Republican elected in November, has thrown his support behind both bills. He currently serves as the sole final authority over the state investments. His GOP predecessor, Dale Folwell, had practiced a more conservative approach to the pension fund.

‘Investment authority’ would be appointed, require experience
The five-member North Carolina Investment Authority would include the treasurer and four other members. The treasurer, Speaker of the House, Senate President Pro Tem and governor would be able to appoint one member each.
Appointees would be required to have “expert knowledge of investments” and more than 10 years of “successful management” of pensions, endowments or other investments.
The board would appoint a chief investment officer — someone with similar, if not more extensive, qualifications to board appointees. That CIO would negotiate and execute third-party contracts on behalf of the board.
HB 506 passed the House with little discussion Tuesday, 110-3.
Pension fund could include Bitcoin
The bill to allow investment in cryptocurrency is backed by House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell).
It limits the investments to the crypto equivalent of mutual funds, rather than direct investments in specific currencies.
And it lays the groundwork for the treasurer and law enforcement to examine both a “strategic reserve” of digital assets collected by the state, as well as allowing state employees to invest part of their portfolios in crypto.
The bill’s supporters view it as another plank of proactive and wise investing — arguing that the state should utilize a growing corner of the market.
“We need to spread the allocation around,” said Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort). “Just like any good investment broker would do for you.”
But Democrats who opposed the measure warned of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ volatility — and cautioned against betting part of state workers’ pensions on them.
“I still have a lot of questions about this investment strategy and the level of commitment we’re making to it,” said Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake).
Opinions on the bill outside of the General Assembly have split. Gov. Josh Stein has said he supports the measure and allowing Briner to have more control over state investments. Representatives of the State Employees Association of North Carolina have expressed opposition.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — A seemingly divided U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday over the nation’s first religious charter school that aims to open in Oklahoma, putting the constitutionality of a state-funded Catholic education to the test.
An Oklahoma state board approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.
The nation’s highest Court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.

Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the Court is expected by the end of June.
The Court’s liberal justices — Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson — appeared doubtful that previous rulings support the idea that a charter school could constitutionally adopt a religion. Kagan also wondered about the nationwide implications of permitting publicly funded religious schools.
Kavanaugh, part of the Court’s conservative majority, said disapproving a charter school solely on religious grounds “seems like rank discrimination against religion.” Opening charter school funding to faith-based institutions would “be expanding the options, not contracting the options” of school choice in public education, he said.
“All the religious school is saying is, ‘Don’t exclude us based on religion,’” Kavanaugh said.
Jackson and Kagan, though, pointed to ways St. Isidore’s founding contract differs from that of other charter schools. The school pledged to comply with state regulations and non-discrimination laws only to the extent that Catholic doctrine allows.
The Court made prior decisions that religious schools can’t be excluded from government grants and state-funded tuition assistance programs. In those cases, Jackson said, a religious school wasn’t changing the terms of a government program.
“It seems to me you are not seeking the same public benefit as everyone else,” Jackson said.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.
“We are grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court heard our case and now entrust it to their wisdom,” Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley and Tulsa Bishop David A. Konderla said in a statement Wednesday. “Of course, we pray and hope for a decision that stands with religious liberty and the rights of Oklahoma families to make their own decisions in selecting the best educational options for their children.”
Both the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. Oklahoma’s attorney general has led the legal battle against the school.

Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore.
Both contended charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.
After leaving the courtroom, Campbell said he found the justices “very receptive to the arguments we were making.”
“The law is on our side,” Campbell said. “The First Amendment says when you create a program and invite everyone in but tell only religious groups that they can’t come, that violates the Constitution.”
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
Charter schools bear all necessary resemblance to traditional school districts to be considered public, Garre said. The state can open and close a charter school, unlike a fully private institution. They are subject to the equal academic standards as Oklahoma public schools and most of the same regulations, though they have more flexibility over teaching methods and employee hiring.
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Laws in 47 states, including Oklahoma, and federal law all define charter schools as public schools and forbid them from religious affiliation.
Like all public schools, Garre said, charter schools must comply with church-state separation.
Kagan seemed to agree.
“When I look at Oklahoma and its charter schools program, they look like regular public schools,” she said. “These charter schools, except for some things on the margin, are equivalent to public schools. So why shouldn’t we take the state at its word (that they are public)?”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state.
Drummond contended St. Isidore would create a “slippery slope” leading to charter schools teaching faith systems that most Oklahomans would disagree with — a position Alito said “seems to be based on hostility to certain religions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt has been a vocal advocate of opening St. Isidore. Standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Stitt said the school “expands choice and freedom,”  and the government shouldn’t stand in the way.
“I think the Supreme Court is going to rule with us because it’s just common sense,” he said.
Charter school advocates feared a ruling in St. Isidore’s favor could cause a widespread closure of charter programs in states that won’t abide taxpayer-funded religious education.
All of a sudden, “we won’t know what the rules are for charter schools anymore in 47 states and the federal level,” said Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.
“This is going to shut down the charter school program in many states where there is simply no appetite by state lawmakers to fund religious schools,” Coleman said after oral arguments. “States like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois where there are millions of children attending charter schools today.”

The township paid for the concert with national opioid settlement funds. (Photo courtesy of Irvington Township)Irvington officials have sued the New Jersey Office of the State Comptroller for defamation, asking a judge to block the fraud watchdog from releasing a forthcoming report they said wrongly slams the township for paying for an “opioid awareness concert” last year with national opioid settlement funds.
Mayor Anthony Vauss and other officials accuse the comptroller’s investigators of an abuse of power, harassment, racial discrimination, and “targeted character assassination” for a draft report the office shared with the township earlier this month for feedback.
While the report has yet to be released, township attorney Ramon E. Rivera teased its contents over 158 pages of briefs and other documents filed Tuesday in state Superior Court in Essex County.
The comptroller’s draft report raises allegations of fraud, contract improprieties, misuse of money, ethical violations and more related to the June 8 concert that drew over 3,000 spectators and featured R&B performers including Musiq Soulchild, Donell Jones, and Q Parker, Rivera wrote.
Investigators claim the township flouted public bidding requirements to give Taj Entertainment a $200,000 contract to run the concert, according to Rivera. He denied that claim, saying retaining high-caliber musical artists is a permissible exception to public-bidding requirements because it’s a service that’s “inherently qualitative and not amenable to traditional competitive bidding.”
Rivera said investigators contend — incorrectly — that the concert was not an “evidence-based” use of opioid settlement funds as required by the settlement agreements, the attorney general, and state law. The funds are part of more than $1.1 billion New Jersey and its local governments expect to receive through 2038 under agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors, and retailers for their roles in the deadly opioid epidemic.
The opioid awareness concerts, where township staff distributed the overdose-reversing drug Narcan and information about opioid addiction and treatment, are a proven community engagement model that other municipalities around the country have used to combat opioid addiction, Rivera wrote. They’re also particularly effective in Black communities, he added. Almost 80% of Irvington’s 61,000 residents are Black, census figures show.
“In its ongoing and increasingly personal crusade against the Township of Irvington, the OSC has not merely made recommendations or raised concerns — it has orchestrated a narrative designed to humiliate, mislead, and destroy public trust in a majority-Black community with an understanding of the needs of its residents,” Rivera wrote. “This is not negligence. It is not misunderstanding. It is not good-faith oversight. It is a pattern of reckless disregard for the truth, weaponized insinuation, and culturally incompetent analysis cloaked in bureaucratic language.”
A separate but related court fight now under way shines more light on the Irvington business dealings state investigators are probing.
The township hosted a similar opioid awareness concert in June 2023 and paid $168,500 to a business called Taj Lounge 973 to run it, without putting that contract out for public bid either, according to a complaint state prosecutors filed in March in Mercer County.
Taj Entertainment and Taj Lounge 973 both are owned by family members of Antoine Richardson, an employee of the township since 2014, the complaint says. Prosecutors said Richardson, who emceed the 2024 concert as “DJ Qua,” his son Tajsh Richardson, and another relative, Trennetha Green-Richardson, have not complied since last summer with subpoenas the comptroller’s office issued in its concert investigation, and they asked a judge to compel compliance. A hearing is set for May 7.
But Rivera, in Tuesday’s lawsuit, said those familial connections were long disclosed and investigators have not proven any “unlawful dual compensation or improper procurement.”
He also defended “the Township’s reliance on a non-traditional timekeeping system for remote employees — including Richardson,” saying no regulations required detailed timesheets for “public DJs.”
He complained that the office circulated its draft report to several state agencies for review.
“It has already weakened the Township’s credibility and has not even been released to the population at large,” he wrote.
Pamela Kruger, a spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office, said investigators are confident in their findings and aim to release the report “very soon.”
“As part of OSC’s standard due process procedures, we sent a copy of our draft report to Irvington and the involved parties to invite comment and correct any factual inaccuracies in the draft prior to publication,” Kruger said. “Irvington went to court in an attempt to further delay our investigation and reporting.”
Besides Vauss and Richardson, the plaintiffs listed in Irvington’s lawsuit are Musa Malik, its business administrator; Faheem Ra’oof, its chief financial officer; and Althea Headley, its director of purchasing.
They want a judge to bar the report’s release and declare that the comptroller’s office exceeded its authority and that their use of opioid settlement funds was lawful. They’re also seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.
The lawsuit is just the latest backlash against the comptroller’s office, which uncovers public fraud, waste, and abuse and recommends policy reforms. Lawmakers still have not confirmed acting state Comptroller Kevin D. Walsh, more than five years since Gov. Phil Murphy put him in the job. Senate President Nick Scutari suggested in January that the state should consolidate its watchdogs, even as public corruption continues to dominate the headlines.
The comptroller’s office has issued critical reports of Irvington’s fiscal management before, urging state leaders last year to appoint an independent monitor to safeguard public funds after township officials failed to remedy financial problems state investigators first uncovered in 2009 and 2011.
Irvington, in turn, has vigorously fought scrutiny of its operations. In 2022, Irvington sued an 82-year-old retired schoolteacher for her “voluminous” public records requests, and the following year, fought an attorney’s records requests and accused him of perjury.
Elouise McDaniel, now 85, beat Irvington’s case against her when the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey and CJ Griffin, an attorney who specializes in public records access, intervened pro bono on her behalf. Wednesday, she urged the comptroller’s office to continue its probe and not be cowed by Irvington’s lawsuit.
“They file a complaint against anyone who is concerned about the misuse of public funds,” McDaniel said. “It’s ridiculous. It’s about time that the mayor stopped this.”

They are subject to the equal academic standards as Oklahoma public schools and most of the same regulations, though they have more flexibility over teaching methods and employee hiring.
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Laws in 47 states, including Oklahoma, and federal law all define charter schools as public schools and forbid them from religious affiliation.
Like all public schools, Garre said, charter schools must comply with church-state separation.
Kagan seemed to agree.
“When I look at Oklahoma and its charter schools program, they look like regular public schools,” she said. “These charter schools, except for some things on the margin, are equivalent to public schools. So why shouldn’t we take the state at its word (that they are public)?”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state.
Drummond contended St. Isidore would create a “slippery slope” leading to charter schools teaching faith systems that most Oklahomans would disagree with — a position Alito said “seems to be based on hostility to certain religions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt has been a vocal advocate of opening St. Isidore. Standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Stitt said the school “expands choice and freedom,”  and the government shouldn’t stand in the way.
“I think the Supreme Court is going to rule with us because it’s just common sense,” he said.

Charter school advocates feared a ruling in St. Isidore’s favor could cause a widespread closure of charter programs in states that won’t abide taxpayer-funded religious education.
All of a sudden, “we won’t know what the rules are for charter schools anymore in 47 states and the federal level,” said Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.
“This is going to shut down the charter school program in many states where there is simply no appetite by state lawmakers to fund religious schools,” Coleman said after oral arguments. “States like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois where there are millions of children attending charter schools today.”

Lawmakers apparently are close to a deal to resolve one of Springfield’s most hotly contested issues this session: transit reform.

Public transit agencies in Chicagoland — a region with roughly two-thirds of Illinois’ population — face a collective $770 million budget gap in the upcoming fiscal year. Heads of the agencies have turned to the state to fill that gap, but lawmakers have consistently said that reform of the agencies’ government and better oversight are required before addressing funding.

If lawmakers don’t reach a deal to reform the northeastern Illinois transit system and introduce new funding before their May 31 adjournment, transit officials say it will result in significant cuts, which would result in a “nightmare scenario,” according to Regional Transportation Authority spokesperson Tina Fassett Smith.

Sen. Don DeWitte, R-St. Charles, told reporters this week that lawmakers in the Senate “are very close to agreed language on governance,” meaning a deal is close.

DeWitte, a longtime former mayor of suburban St. Charles and ranking Republican on the Senate’s Transportation committee, said the deal would leave in place the three “service boards” that operate transit in Chicago and the suburbs: the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra commuter rail service and Pace Suburban Bus.

The agreement, according to DeWitte, would provide new oversight powers to a “newly empowered” RTA, the agency that currently handles some financial oversight for the region’s transit agencies.

DeWitte was on the 16-member board of directors for the RTA for five years before joining the Illinois Senate.

Several proposals for reform have been pitched in recent months, with the plan outlined by DeWitte being similar to what he called the “labor bill” — a plan initially put forward by a coalition of organized labor groups and unions.

But the brief description has superficial similarities to a plan proposed by RTA chairman and former Republican state senator Kirk Dillard. That plan also would empower the RTA

A more aggressive reform plan, which would have dissolved the three service boards and consolidated them into one agency, was proposed by transit activists and environmentalists. That consolidation plan was formalized into bills presented by Chicago Democrats Sen. Ram Villivalam and Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado.

While DeWitte is familiar with the negotiations, others involved differ on how close lawmakers are to a deal.

Villivalam, who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee, said he and his colleagues are “continuing discussions” about the bill.

“As we head into the remaining weeks of our spring legislative session, I look forward to working toward a solution that provides safe, reliable, accessible, and integrated public transit to the northeastern Illinois region,” Villivalam said in a statement.

The House of Representatives might bring other hurdles to a transit reform deal as lawmakers barrel toward their expected adjournment.

Rep. Marty Moylan, D-Des Plaines, who chairs a House committee that would likely hear a transit reform bill, has said repeatedly that no bill will be called in his committee that doesn’t meet his standards, including addressing concerns about safety on trains and buses.

But he echoed DeWitte’s read on the situation that a proposal similar to organized labor’s pitch will win out.

“That seems to be the consensus of the General Assembly: Leave the boards in, have them do some reforms, and let’s move forward,” Moylan told Capitol News Illinois. “We’re making progress with some of the transit agencies. The RTA still doesn’t get it, but they will by the end.”

‘Irresponsible’ PR campaign

The RTA, to raise awareness and potentially influence negotiations in Springfield, launched the “Save Transit Now” ad campaign earlier this month. That campaign features television and radio ads in English and Spanish as well as ads on billboards, digital signs, newspapers and social media.

The campaign encourages RTA riders to write emails to their lawmakers with the subject line “Save Transit Now: Support $1.5 billion and an empowered RTA” and a prewritten message.

This frustrated several lawmakers involved in transit negotiations.

“To cry broke with one hand and drop three-quarters of a million dollars on a PR campaign with the other is wrong, and frankly, it’s irresponsible,” Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, wrote in the Chicago Tribune on Tuesday.

Buckner chairs the informal “working group” responsible for negotiating transit issues in the House.

Moylan, meanwhile, said the agency was “wasting all kinds of money” on the campaign, which isn’t going to make the General Assembly change its policies.

“It’s not how it works,” Moylan said. “It may have worked years ago, but not now.”

Fassett Smith, the director of communications at the RTA, said the $750,000 price tag was an upper estimate of the cost and said it is the agencies’ “obligation” to make sure transit riders were aware of the RTA's dire financial straits.

Another potential wrinkle as lawmakers wrap up negotiations comes from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who is in Springfield this week to meet with lawmakers about the city’s legislative priorities. Among them: transit funding.

“The city of Chicago deserves its fair share, and we're going to continue to advocate for that, as I've already done,” Johnson said at a Tuesday news conference.

Johnson has a strained relationship with lawmakers in Springfield after several perceived missteps since he took office, including dragging his feet in funding migrant aid last year, arriving late in legislative sessions to discuss budget matters, and publicly clashing with Gov. JB Pritzker and other lawmakers over hemp regulation earlier this year.

Johnson has repeatedly in recent months pointed out that Chicagoans make up the majority of ridership among the three transit agencies that make up the RTA. When asked Tuesday whether that means Chicagoans should also be funding a majority of public transportation in the region, Johnson didn’t rule it out.

“That’s a conclusion that one could draw,” Johnson said.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A tax restructuring plan that would increase income taxes for about a quarter of South Carolina filers and cut them for more than 40% advanced Wednesday in the House.
While the plan is expected to clear the House in the session’s waning days, the Senate’s highly unlikely to take it up. That means the only change in the tax code this year will be a state budget that shaves $290 million in revenue — fulfilling the final cut of a 2022 law.


Tax change impacts
In the first year of the proposed change, the shift in liability would cause:

42% of tax filers to pay, on average, $488 less
24% of filers to pay, on average, $266 more
33% of filers to see no change

Source: S.C. Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office


House Republicans hope sending the tax restructuring plan over to the Senate next week will enable it to reach Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk early in 2026 — in time to be included in the next budget process.
Republicans have long wanted to reduce the state’s top marginal rate to make South Carolina appear more competitive. With the soon-to-be 6% rate still the Southeast’s highest — even though the effective rate is about half that — Republicans contend the state needs to bring it down to keep attracting companies and their executives.
The House’s chief budget writer said it’s about removing the “sticker shock” for businesses.
“We looked out of line with the way we treat our actual tax base,” said Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister.
But Democrats question the need altogether, noting the existing tax structure hasn’t hindered South Carolina from being one of the nation’s fastest-growing states.
“If we are competing for people, we are certainly winning,” said House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, D-Columbia. “The question then lies, who is it that we are competing for that we’re not winning? And why is it that we’re not winning?”
The proposal approved Wednesday by the House Ways and Means Committee on a mostly party-line 17-6 vote is very different from what was initially announced a month ago by GOP lawmakers with much fanfare. After an analysis showed 60% of tax filers would pay more, the pushback prompted House Republicans to put their bill on hold and ask the state’s fiscal experts for a review of options.
“When you get resistance like that, you pack up and try a different path,” said Bannister, R-Greenville.
The new plan selected by his committee no longer moves immediately to a single, flat tax rate (which the bill did as introduced). Rather, it collapses the state’s three tax rates into two — eliminating the bottom rate, which resulted in zero taxes paid, and reducing the top two tiers.
Another reason Republicans give for restructuring the tax code is that it results in 44% of tax filers paying zero state income taxes. Meanwhile, 10% of filers pay for 65% of the state’s total income tax collections.
Republicans say that’s inherently unfair.
“Let’s have a larger percentage of people paying, and let’s lower the burden on everybody,” Bannister said.
Under the changes advanced Wednesday, more than one third of tax filers would still pay zero income taxes.
As the original bill did, the amended version would decouple South Carolina’s income tax code from the federal system.
By being one of just five states to tax “federal taxable income,” South Carolinians start their state tax forms with less income to tax, compared to what they’d file if they lived across the state border.
Taxing adjusted gross income as most states do would make South Carolina’s taxes truly comparable to its neighbors. Republicans contend it would also put South Carolina back in control of state tax collections, instead of being tied to the whims of Washington politics.
Under the proposed two-tier plan, taxpayers would pay 1.99% on the first $30,000 of their taxable income, after all applicable state exemptions and deductions are taken. Every dollar after that would be taxed at 5.39%.
The plan would reduce tax collections overall by $400 million in year one — almost double what the initial bill would have done.
Republicans said that will only reduce anticipated increases in revenues. They contend no cut in state services would be necessary.
The plan calls for eventually reaching a single tax rate of 1.99%. Potential annual cuts would depend on estimated income tax collections rising by at least 5%. Doing so slowly rather than all at once is expected to cause less of a tax shift.
It’s impossible to make structural changes to the tax code without creating winners and losers, said Frank Rainwater, director of the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, which makes the revenue projections legislators use in crafting a state budget.
“There’s a consequence for every action you make,” Rainwater told the committee.
The bill still calls to eventually eliminate income taxes at some point.
Members of the uber-conservative Freedom Caucus have called for immediately eliminating income taxes. But that would require slashing state spending by nearly half.
Last fiscal year, income tax collections totaled $6.1 billion, accounting for nearly 45% of the state’s general fund revenues, according to the state’s fiscal experts.
Rep. Brandon Newton, chairman of Ways and Means’ tax policy subcommittee, said phasing in cuts based on projected revenue increases will avoid cutting essential services.
“This is, in my mind, a responsible way to get rid of the income tax and, in reality, the only rational way to get rid of the income tax,” said the Lancaster Republican.
Of the seven Democrats who sit on the Ways and Means Committee, only one voted to advance the plan: Rep. Leon Stavrinakis of Charleston, who chairs the economic development subcommittee.
Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, the longest-serving legislator in the House, said if the state’s tax code is really making business executives hesitant about locating here, then the problem might be marketing, not the tax structure itself.
She cautioned against pushing through a major change that might result in unintended consequences.
“I just think there are a lot of implications that we may or may not be thinking about,” said the Orangeburg Democrat, who’s also first vice chair of Ways and Means.
She again pointed to the state’s last huge tax swap as a cautionary example.
The 2006 law known by its number, Act 388, increased the state sales tax by a penny on the dollar to reduce homeowners’ property taxes, creating a host of unintended consequences for real estate, business property taxes, and school district budgets that Cobb-Hunter said they’re still feeling two decades later.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/income-tax-newser-wideshot-1024x763.jpg,,,2025-04-30 17:10:27.495238

Patrick Morrisey has approved a Democrat-sponsored bill requiring utility companies to create plans to notify customers of outages and another bill establishing procedure for filling vacancies to state offices.

In November 2023, a gas outage affected about 1,000 residents on Charleston's West Side for weeks. (Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)Gov. Patrick Morrisey has approved a Democrat-sponsored bill requiring utility companies to create plans to notify customers of outages and another bill establishing procedure for filling vacancies to state offices.
House Bill 3263 was introduced in response to a November 2023 gas outage that left more than 1,000 residents of Charleston’s West Side without heat and the ability to cook for weeks. The outage was caused by a “significant sustained water leak” that infiltrated 46 miles of the company’s natural gas distribution system, according to Mountaineer Gas. 
The bill requires that such communication plans at least include a way of notifying customers in advance of planned service disruptions, methods of communication and include an estimate of the duration and end of the outage. The plans are to be filed with the West Virginia Public Service Commission. The bill is effective July 10.
“We would think that utilities would already be required to effectively communicate with their customers during these types of situations and during outages, whether they’re planned or unexpected,” said Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, a West Side resident and sponsor of the bill. “One would think that would already be the law. What we found out in late 2023, is that was not the case. 
“The rate payers, the customers over on the West Side, were not well informed,” he said. “We were getting our information from the media. We weren’t getting updates from the utility.”
Pushkin originally introduced the bill during the 2024 legislative session. It had unanimous support in the House, but stalled in the Senate, he said. 
The bill codifies a requirement the Public Service Commission already has for utility companies. In an October 2024 order, the PSC mandated that the utility companies and cable companies have text and email messaging in place to notify customers of outages.
The legislation is one of two with Democratic lead sponsors that Morrisey signed this year, Pushkin said. 
The governor also signed Senate Bill 586, which requires that when filling vacancies of state officials, justices, judges and magistrates, the appointment be made from the same party that originally held the seat at the time of election, not the party to which the official may have switched before he or she resigned. 
“This is a bill about fundamental fairness and ensuring the will of the voters, and not the party in power, is reflected in filling vacancies in the Legislature,” bill sponsor Joey Garcia, D-Marion, said in a news release.
The bill has been called the “de Soto bill,”  a reference to Joseph de Soto, whose seat in the House of Delegates was vacated after he was arrested on charges of threatening to harm and kill lawmakers. De Soto was elected in November as a Republican then switched to the Democratic party hours before he was arrested. Morrisey appointed a Republican to the seat. The Democrats filed a legal challenge, arguing that House Republicans didn’t follow the proper Constitutional procedure in vacating his seat and that there was legal precedent that the seat should go to Democrats due to de Soto’s party switch.
In 2014, former Sen. Daniel Hall switched parties from Democrat to Republican just days after the election, shifting the control of the body to the GOP. He resigned from the Senate in December 2015, leaving some questions as to which party should fill the seat. The next year, the state Supreme Court ruled that Republicans should replace Hall. 
“The Supreme Court got it wrong in 2016, when they ignored the will of the voters in their decision to allow Daniel Hall’s seat to go to a Republican, ignoring the fact that Hall was elected as a Democrat,” Pushkin said in a news release Wednesday. “The Republicans in the Legislature got it wrong in 2018 when they codified this bad decision into law because it benefited them politically to do so. We knew it was a bad law when earlier this year the Republicans twisted themselves into knots in order to ignore the law they passed in 2018 so they wouldn’t have to fill the vacancy they created in House District 91 with a Democrat. We applaud Sen. Garcia for righting this wrong and restoring the voice of the people to this process.”

(Photo courtesy of New Jersey Assembly)New Jersey’s Department of Labor is unlikely to see its federal funding cut through the end of the U.S. government’s October-to-September fiscal year, but officials remain concerned about the prospect of future cuts, state Labor Commissioner Rob Asaro-Angelo told Assembly lawmakers Wednesday.
“In my mind, we are status quo through the end of September. At that point, we’ll see what Congress does,” Asaro-Angelo told the panel. “It’s hard to predict what’s going to happen, clearly. I think most of the cuts being talked about are not in labor. Traditionally, workforce development has been more of a bipartisan issue.”
Federal dollars account for a significant portion of the department’s annual budget. In the coming July-to-June state fiscal year, the $603.2 million in federal monies the department expects to receive would account for 48.5% of its proposed operational budget.
The impact of federal funding on department staffing is greater. Such monies are set to fund roughly 72.6% of the department’s 3,184 positions in the coming 2026 fiscal year, including all positions administering unemployment insurance, according to budget materials and the commissioner’s testimony.
The department, along with all others receiving federal dollars, faced a federal funding freeze earlier this year under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that called for the U.S. government to stop to all disbursements of federal financial assistance.
“Remember, the week after inauguration, basically our access and many departments’ access to federal funding ceased,” the commissioner said. “It was, no doubt about it, the craziest time in our department since COVID.”
That order has since been paused under a preliminary injunction issued by a Rhode Island District Court judge.
New Jersey’s unemployment fund is still recovering from record-high jobless claims seen during the pandemic. Asaro-Angelo said the state’s Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund had a balance of $1.6 billion, which he expected would rise to roughly $2 billion after unemployment taxes billed in the first quarter of 2025 were collected.
“We’re very healthy. I give major credit to the folks around me, but also to be clear: We’re healthy because we have ever-increasing employment in New Jersey,” the commissioner said. “These contributions come from workers who are working and employers who are employing people, and as I said in my remarks, we have more workers than ever before, more businesses than ever before.”
Still, the department, in separate responses to lawmakers, cautioned that employers’ unemployment tax rates would remain elevated through fiscal 2027.
It said rates would have been lower in both fiscal 2026 and 2027 were it not for a 2020 law that phased in employer unemployment tax increases in a bid to defray the tax impact of high joblessness.
The overall health of the unemployment trust fund determines the range of employer unemployment tax rates used in a given fiscal year, while an individual employer’s use of unemployment benefits determines their rate within that range. Rates for fiscal 2025 ranged from 0.6% to 6.4%.

An Oklahoma state board approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.

The nation’s highest court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.
Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the court is expected by the end of June.
 Publicly funding religious schools or expanding school choice?

The court’s liberal justices — Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson — appeared doubtful that previous rulings support the idea that a charter school could constitutionally adopt a religion. Kagan also wondered about the nationwide implications of permitting publicly funded religious schools.
Kavanaugh, part of the court’s conservative majority, said disapproving a charter school solely on religious grounds “seems like rank discrimination against religion.” Opening charter school funding to faith-based institutions would “be expanding the options, not contracting the options” of school choice in public education, he said.
“All the religious school is saying is, ‘Don’t exclude us based on religion,’” Kavanaugh said.
Jackson and Kagan, though, pointed to ways St. Isidore’s founding contract differs from that of other charter schools. The school pledged to comply with state regulations and non-discrimination laws only to the extent that Catholic doctrine allows.
The court made prior decisions that religious schools can’t be excluded from government grants and state-funded tuition assistance programs. In those cases, Jackson said, a religious school wasn’t changing the terms of a government program.
“It seems to me you are not seeking the same public benefit as everyone else,” Jackson said.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.

Konderla said in a statement Wednesday. “Of course, we pray and hope for a decision that stands with religious liberty and the rights of Oklahoma families to make their own decisions in selecting the best educational options for their children.”
The school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. Oklahoma’s attorney general has led the legal battle against the school.
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore.
Both contended charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.
After leaving the courtroom, Campbell said he found the justices “very receptive to the arguments we were making.”

“The law is on our side,” Campbell said. “The First Amendment says when you create a program and invite everyone in but tell only religious groups that they can’t come, that violates the Constitution.”
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
Charter schools bear all necessary resemblance to traditional school districts to be considered public, Garre said. The state can open and close a charter school, unlike a fully private institution. They are subject to the equal academic standards as Oklahoma public schools and most of the same regulations, though they have more flexibility over teaching methods and employee hiring.
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Laws in 47 states, including Oklahoma, and federal law all define charter schools as public schools and forbid them from religious affiliation.
Like all public schools, Garre said, charter schools must comply with church-state separation.
 Should religious charter schools receive taxpayer dollars?

Kagan seemed to agree.
“When I look at Oklahoma and its charter schools program, they look like regular public schools,” she said. “These charter schools, except for some things on the margin, are equivalent to public schools. So why shouldn’t we take the state at its word (that they are public)?”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state.
Drummond contended St. Isidore would create a “slippery slope” leading to charter schools teaching faith systems that most Oklahomans would disagree with — a position Alito said “seems to be based on hostility to certain religions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt has been a vocal advocate of opening St. Isidore. Standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Stitt said the school “expands choice and freedom,”  and the government shouldn’t stand in the way.
“I think the Supreme Court is going to rule with us because it’s just common sense,” he said.

Charter school advocates feared a ruling in St. Isidore’s favor could cause a widespread closure of charter programs in states that won’t abide taxpayer-funded religious education.
All of a sudden, “we won’t know what the rules are for charter schools anymore in 47 states and the federal level,” said Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.
“This is going to shut down the charter school program in many states where there is simply no appetite by state lawmakers to fund religious schools,” Coleman said after oral arguments. “States like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois where there are millions of children attending charter schools today.”

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)State tourism officials plan to spend nearly $1 million to promote Rhode Island on the HISTORY Channel through next July as the network commemorates the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States.
The Rhode Island Commerce Corporation has partnered with the HISTORY Channel to air commercials promoting the first state to declare independence from Great Britain as part of the networks’ “History Honors 250” campaign. The deal is the network’s first with any state, according to the corporation’s April 25 announcement.
“You can’t tell the story of America without telling the story of Rhode Island,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement. “Showcasing Rhode Island’s rich HISTORY through this partnership with the HISTORY Channel not only honors our state’s heritage — it drives tourism and strengthens our local economy.”
“History Honors 250” will share Rhode Island’s role in American HISTORY through specially produced segments to air on the cable network, along with ads during select prime-time shows.
But the Commerce Corporation is keeping hush on what historic moments will be featured in the $965,000 campaign. Spokesperson Matt Touchette said ads were still being developed by a third-party company as of Tuesday afternoon. He declined to name the third party company, saying the terms of the contract are confidential.
“When we’re ready to release more details, I’ll be sure to let you know,” Touchette said in an email.
Meanwhile, in response to an inquiry from Rhode Island Current, McKee’s office offered via email: “The Governor is excited to see the rich history of Rhode Island showcased nationally—including the legacy of Roger Williams and the Burning of the Gaspee.”  
Rhode Island’s partnership with the HISTORY Channel will include themed editorial articles and video content posted online, as well as social media engagement through branded posts and influencer collaborations, Touchette said.
The Rhode Island Commerce Corporation will hold a sweepstakes, which the HISTORY Channel will promote on social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook along with an interactive trivia unit to highlight the state’s historic milestones, cultural contributions, and notable figures.
The ad campaign is scheduled to kick off May 22 and run through July 5, 2026.
“Rhode Island holds a pivotal role in the rich tapestry of our nation’s HISTORY, and we are excited to craft engaging content that not only resonates with audiences today but also inspires future generations,” Niki Mandell, vice president of media solutions at A+E Global Media, HISTORY Channel’s parent company, said in a statement.

(Ethan DeWitt | New Hampshire Bulletin)A federal judge in New Hampshire ordered the Trump administration to restore the immigration record of a Dartmouth College student from China, weeks after it was deleted without warning.
In an order released Tuesday, Judge Samantha Elliott of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), requiring that the student’s record be put back and stopping it from being eliminated again. The injunction will last for the duration of a lawsuit filed by the student, Xiaotian Liu.
Liu, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science, received an email from the college on April 4 informing him there was no longer a record of him in the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), the DHS database that displays the immigration status for international students. Liu’s visa was not revoked and he did not face deportation, but the deletion of the record forced him to stop his doctoral research, and stop earning a salary from the college.
Initially, the department did not provide a reason. Liu later sued to restore the record with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and Ron Abramson, an attorney for Shaheen & Gordon. He claimed the record deletion violated the Administrative Procedure Act, as well as his Fifth Amendment right to due process, as there was no warning and no way to contest the decision. 
DHS later suggested in an affidavit that the record was deleted in part due to an incident at the Detroit Airport in 2022 in which Liu encountered an administrative error with his study visa and was required to return to China temporarily. And lawyers for the government sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that DHS had authority over the database and that Liu had not proven that he was irreparably harmed, since he could still transfer to Ph.D. programs in other countries. 
But Elliott disagreed, writing that Liu’s inability to continue his research “has significant and irreparable consequences for his academic trajectory.” She noted that Dartmouth policy caps funding for doctoral research to five years, and said the record deletion could put Liu in a position where he could fail to finish his Ph.D. 
Elliott also noted that if he were blocked from his research for a substantial length of time, Liu could be found to be out of compliance with his student visa requirements, which could lead to his immigration status being terminated. That, in turn, could lead to deportation. 
“… The termination of Liu’s F-1 status and SEVIS record exposes him to the possibility of removal,” Elliott wrote. “The threat of removal constitutes irreparable harm in this case because of the interplay between Liu’s immigration status and his academic and professional development.”
The order came after the Trump administration announced Friday that it would restore the SEVIS status for thousands of students whose status had been effectively suspended when the records were deleted. But in Liu’s case, Elliott’s order guarantees that his status will remain unchanged and his SEVIS record intact for the duration of the trial.
The order does not end the legal fight; lawyers for both sides are now moving into the discovery phase of the lawsuit, and will eventually return to the district court for a trial.
“We are thrilled that this court ruling means Xiaotian can continue researching what he loves — computer science — right here in New Hampshire,” said Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire, in a statement. “The court made clear today that no administration can circumvent the law to unilaterally punish students who have followed all of the rules and strip them of their legal status, disrupt their studies, and put them at risk of deportation.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Xiaotian-Liu-press-conference-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-04-30 16:07:16.842236

(Photo: Aire images/ Getty)Forgoing a moratorium on new artificial turf fields, lawmakers are recommending the state still study the effects they could have on public health and the environment. 
The members of the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee who were present for a work session Wednesday afternoon unanimously endorsed an amended version of LD 1177. The bill will next go to the Maine House of Representatives and Senate for approval.
Originally, the bill sought to place a three-year moratorium on the installation and reinstallation of synthetic turf athletic fields while the Department of Environmental Protection conducted a study to determine how those materials interact with the health of local environments and the people who recreate on those fields. 
However, the amended bill backed by the committee nixed the moratorium and narrowed the study to look at how synthetic turf affects ambient air, groundwater and surrounding organisms, as well as disposal options once the fields reach the end of their life. The study would also evaluate any release of microplastics from the fields and the effect of that on the surrounding environment and human health. 
The department would need to submit a report to the Legislature with its findings in the study by January 2028.
Commissioner Melanie Loyzim said the department is comfortable with the amended proposal and feels it is within their expertise and jurisdiction. However, she said it will require additional resources so the bill will likely end up on what is called the “special study table,” where legislative leaders determine which studies will get funded. 
If the department used an environmental consulting firm to assist with the study, Loyzim said it could cost around $100,000 to $200,000, but the department would look to use students and research resources from the University of Maine, potentially, to bring those costs down. 
Sen. Denise Tepler (D-Sagadahoc), who co-chairs the committee, said it was interesting to hear conflicting science on the issue, so she thinks an analysis of existing literature and any new research would be helpful for future decision making. 
Her fellow co-chair, Rep. Vicki Doudera (D-Camden), echoed the sentiment, describing the turf issue as “tricky.” 
“I really am in support of studying this further and getting a handle on what’s going on,” Doudera said.

(Photo courtesy of Andy O'Brien/ Maine AFL-CIO)When Scott Surette left the U.S. Marine Corps after serving in the Gulf War, with tours in Iraq and Kuwait, he took a job at the U.S. Postal Service. 
Like millions of other veterans, he was drawn to the stability of federal employment and benefits, including the military buy back program that allows veteran workers to count military service as a credit towards their retirement. 
Now, he says, “the contract we make as a country with veterans is currently being broken.”
During a news conference in Augusta on Tuesday, Surette, who serves as president of Branch 122 of the National Postal Mailhandlers Union Local 301, spoke alongside state and national union leaders who highlighted the disproportionate impact that federal cuts will have on veterans. 
National AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said she’s travelled the country to hear from workers impacted by federal cuts. Asked about what she’s heard from union members who supported President Donald Trump, she said that his recent executive order that ended collective bargaining rights for federal unions was a wake up call for many. 
“And so whether you’re in the federal sector, public sector, the private sector, this injury to one is an injury to all is really starting to take hold within our labor movement,” Shuler said. “And I think working people broadly see what’s on the horizon.” 
Cynthia Phinney, president of the Maine AFL-CIO, pointed out that with an estimated 106,000 veterans, Maine has the highest concentration of any state in the nation. And nationally, roughly one in three federal workers is a veteran. 
She said widespread federal worker layoffs, including the Trump administration’s reduction in force plan to return staffing at the Department of Veterans Affairs to 2019 levels, which could cut more than 80,000 jobs, is a “betrayal of the promise we made to men and women in uniform.”
Pointing out those layoffs would amount to 15% of the total staff of the VA, Surette said, “We know what that will mean. It’ll mean delays in veterans seeking care. It will mean delays in receiving benefits. It’ll mean harm to veterans. It’ll mean a decline in the quality of care veterans receive. It will mean a promise broken. And as a veteran, that is just plain wrong.”
Liz Harkins, who works in the Veterans Benefits Administration and serves as tri-state president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 2604, representing more than 1,600 employees across New England, said VA employees are “essential workers” who deliver critical health care, essential benefits and other services to “ensure that every veteran receives what they have rightfully earned.”
She said since the 2022 signing of the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins (or PACT) Act, which expanded health care coverage and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances like Agent Orange and open-air burn pits, the agency has seen an “unprecedented surge” in the number of veterans being served.
Noting that VA staff are “already operating under staffing constraints,” Harkins said the proposed layoffs “will have devastating consequences,” causing further delays in both health care and processing services. 
The event Wednesday came on the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. It also marked the conclusion of a two-week long listening session organized by the national AFL-CIO.

(Photo courtesy EVHS)A teacher at an Española high school recently sounded the alarm after a principal requested teachers fill out a database of student information, including citizenship status, as part of an abruptly announced standardized test. 
The 11th grade teacher called a representative with the National Education Association teachers’ union, which sent a cease-and-desist notice to the district superintendent and also told its members not to comply with the information collection, a union spokesperson told Source New Mexico. The spokesperson also said the school where this occurred is Española Valley High School. 
“It came to our attention that a request was made to our educators in Española to determine the immigration status of students in order to, supposedly, register them for a standardized test,” National Education of New Mexico President Mary Parr-Sanchez said in an email. “The request fell outside the scope of our Collective Bargaining Agreement, and our members were informed that they need not to comply.”
The teacher, who declined to comment to Source New Mexico, posted April 21 on an educators’ forum on Reddit that administrators were seeking student citizenship status as part of the rollout of WorkKeys, a job skills assessment run by the same company that does the annual ACT exam for high schoolers preparing for college.
“It is a test that no one at the school has ever administered before and from the way admin explained it, it sound[s] like our new superintendent kind of just sprung it on us out of the blue,” the teacher posted. “(It’s worth noting that we have only 5 weeks of school left, so to introduce an entirely new assessment so late in the year seems highly odd.)”
The request for citizenship status in the Española school occurs amid widespread fears among Hispanic and immigrant communities about federal raids and how citizenship status databases could be used to aid in mass deportation. The Legislature this session passed legislation, which the governor signed, aiming to prevent citizenship status data collected locally from being sent to federal immigration authorities. 
NM advocates call for statewide immigrant data protections amid fear of mass deportation

“Especially given the political climate, this seems like data that is highly improper to request from students,” the teacher wrote. 
Española Superintendent Eric Spencer told Source in an email Friday that he got an email from the NEA “regarding their concern related to testing.” He said his staff has made contact with union leadership and is working with them on the issue. 
“The district takes all matters of student confidentiality seriously,” he said. 
Spencer did not return emails and calls seeking further comment this week. Members of the Española School Board also did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
According to the union, the emailed letter from the union cited the 1982 Plyler v. Doe U.S. Supreme Court case that guarantees the right to a free, public education for all children, regardless of their immigration status. 
“Children, regardless of their immigration or citizenship status, should be free from worry that the educators and administrators tasked with their instruction, safety and well-being would ever seek to cause them harm,” Parr-Sanchez said in a statement to Source NM. 
NM immigration, civil rights groups back enhanced digital privacy protections

Following the back-and-forth with the union, the superintendent has “responded to our cease and desist letter and informed us that the behavior has stopped,” NEA-NM spokesperson Adell Medovoy told Source. The union declined to provide the letter, calling it “internal communications,” she said.
The union is unaware whether the request for citizenship status went to other schools in the district, “although we are on the alert,” Medovoy said. 
A lawyer for the union involved in the cease-and-desist actions, Todd Wertheim, told Source in a brief phone conversation Monday that it was possible a second letter would be necessary soon, though he did not elaborate and did not respond to follow-up phone calls.
Also unclear is why administrators would have tied the ACT’s WorkKeys standardized assessment to a request for student immigration status. The company describes the assessment as a way to determine job-readiness for certain industries, evaluating students’ on “a range of hard and soft skills relevant to any occupation, at any level, and across industries.”
Juan Elizondo, a spokesperson for the ACT, told Source in an email Tuesday that his company has no clue why anyone taking the exam would be asked for immigration status. 
“We cannot speak to why any examinee would be asked about immigration status in connection with an ACT exam,” he said. “This is not a requirement for taking our exams and is not information we collect or use in any way.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/evhsfront_1000.jpg,,,2025-04-30 16:07:16.842236

(Getty Images)A recent policy change by the largest private insurer in New Mexico could result in patients with severe asthma facing additional delays for care.
So says Dr. Michelle Harkins, a pulmonary critical care doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital, in response to a new policy rolled out earlier this month by Blue Cross Blue Shield that mandates asthma patients on a class of injectable drugs self-administer those drugs at home unless their doctors receive prior approval from the insurance company.
“Delaying care by constantly doing prior authorizations is always concerning, not just for asthma, but for the many other specialty medications,” Harkins said. “We want to be able to provide the appropriate care to the right patient in a timely fashion to improve their quality of life.”
The change — which was effective immediately — applied only to patients in New Mexico, Texas, Illinois, Oklahoma and Montana, where Health Care Service Corporation operates Blue Cross Blue Shield, and excludes patients on Medicare, the public health insurance for people 65 and older or Medicaid, which insures low-income people and families, the company said.
The company’s officials declined an interview with Source NM.
“Health Care Service Corporation is committed to expanding access to quality, cost-effective physical and behavioral health care. We updated medical policies for some medications that are FDA-approved for self-administration,” Business Manager Amanda Douglas said in a written statement. “Our policy revision was made with the interests of our members in mind — promoting access to treatment that is convenient and effective.”
Douglas further wrote that patients can contact the company with questions using the number on their member ID or log in to the website Blue Access.
The policy change applies to four medications all in a class of complex drugs called biologics that are expensive to produce and in high demand for treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and other inflammatory conditions. A year of treatment can cost tens of thousands of dollars for monthly or semi-monthly injections.

New Mexico’s asthma rates
Asthma, a chronic lung disease characterized by inflammation and hyper-reactive airways that can cause shortness of breath, coughs, wheezing and chest tightness, affects about 25 million adults and children nationwide.
New Mexico’s asthma rate is about equal to national levels, according to Deyonne Sandoval, a coordinator and evaluator for the state Department of Health’s Environmental Public Health Tracking program.
“Asthma is a complex, highly prevalent costly health condition that affects people in New Mexico statewide,” Sandoval told Source, noting that in 2023, 9.7% of New Mexico adults — about 162,000 people — reported having asthma, and an estimated 1 in 13 children is diagnosed with asthma in the state.
Numbers aren’t broken down by severity, Sandoval said.
A variety of factors can cause asthma, including: genetics, allergies and exposure to certain types of chemicals or other elements that can prompt asthma over time at home or in workplaces.
“In New Mexico, adults and children living in households making less than $25,000 tend to have a high prevalence and poorly controlled asthma,” Sandoval said. National health research attributes high prevalence of asthma to lower-quality housing, which can harbor more triggers, such as mold, poor ventilation and various allergens.
The New Mexico Department of Health recommends anyone diagnosed with asthma to immediately work with a doctor to explore medications, reduce potential triggers and create an asthma management plan.
Additional delays
The insurance changes target medications for patients with very severe asthma, Harkins said.
Patients manage asthma with a variety of medications, depending on the severity, with some medicine used as-needed, daily medication or other long-acting medications to open up airways. But even then, that may not be enough.
“Typically, when a patient is on full therapy and they’re still having problems — needing the rescue inhaler several times a day, or they’re waking up at night or their asthma is not well-controlled — then I may start to look at using a biologic,” Harkins said.
Harkins established UNMH’s severe adult asthma clinic; has assisted the state with its health study on the rate of disease in adults and children; and currently treats patients with asthma.

Has the recent Blue Cross Blue Shield change on biologics affected you? Email reporter Danielle Prokop, or call or text (505) 226-2663. 

She said these drugs can be “a game-changer” for people with severe asthma. Biologics already requires insurance companies permission to prescribe, so the new requirement adds additional red tape.
Harkins said she and her office staff have to spend a significant amount of time justifying the use of biologics in current patients: printing out notices, submitting for review, potentially appealing a denial.
“Sometimes it’ll take three or four times before the use of a drug is approved,” she said.
Biologics not only require permission for initial prescription, they require renewal every year.
Harkins said she understands these are expensive treatments, and that insurance companies want to ensure patients actually need them.
“But then to ask for yet another prior authorization on top of the prior authorization for medications is always a concern, because so much of our time in the clinic is spent justifying why this patient deserves this medication, why we think it’s the best,” Harkins said.
Side effects from biologics are often minor: rashes, dry eyes, joint pains or irritation at the injection site. But very rarely, this class of drugs can cause anaphylaxis, a life-threatening tightening of the airways that can lead to cardiovascular collapse.
This rare, severe reaction usually happens at the beginning of treatments, so Harkins said she always starts new biologics patients on injections in the office. Since the treatments can last years, some patients subsequently opt to take them at home.
“For those patients that take their biologics at home, I have prescribed them an EpiPen, something to treat anaphylaxis, in case anything happens, they can self-administer,” she said.
Harkins said the changes have not caused an impact for her yet, but she’s had several patients undergoing the prior authorization process just to access the medication. She worries they’ll face further delays in receiving care.
“These kinds of decisions take the decision-making between the doctor and the patient away,” she said.

The $2.4 million in terminated Vermont grants funded positions that focused on “everything from housing placement services, food security, to job training, to after school programming” and flood recovery, said Philip Kolling, who oversees AmeriCorps programs in the state.

Photo courtesy of Erin Riley, AmeriCorps program director at the Vermont Housing and Conservation BoardThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.Soon after floodwaters inundated Montpelier in July 2023, the city tasked its Parks and Trees Department with running a central hub for flood response. That meant Marek Zajac, an AmeriCorps member serving with the department, spent long hours under a tent in the capitol’s downtown. The now 32-year-old kept track of which neighbors needed their homes mucked and gutted — and dispatched available volunteers. With City Hall flooded, “there was nowhere to go to interact with the city — except for us,” Zajac said. “We became both an emotional support…and a way to find help.”Now, Zajac’s job — which involves managing street trees and a community farm when the city isn’t experiencing a disaster — is on pause. That’s due to the latest round of federal cuts to the independent government agency that funds the service position they have held for nearly three years.Last week, AmeriCorps began terminating nearly $400 million in grants across the country that funded thousands of jobs like Zajac’s, including about $2.4 million in funding for service positions in Vermont. An April 25 grant termination letter sent to Philip Kolling, the executive director of SerVermont — which oversees the bulk of the state’s AmeriCorps members — said the state’s grant “no longer effectuates agency priorities” and demanded that recipients “immediately cease all award activities.” The $2.4 million in terminated Vermont grants funded positions that focused on “everything from housing placement services, food security, to job training, to after school programming — and then, importantly, these days, flood recovery,” Kolling said. The grants flow through five state entities, including the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps, and the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation. The terminations impact about 200 AmeriCorps positions, Kolling said. About 70 are currently filled, with many slated to begin this spring and summer, he said. Some are government positions, like Zajac’s, and many others are at nonprofits. Several days after that notice arrived, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a multi-state lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s termination of AmeriCorps grants and positions. The suit, filed on April 29, argues that the administration’s efforts to gut the congressionally-created agency violate the separation of powers enshrined by the U.S. Constitution. “I’m suing to stop the Trump Administration from dismantling AmeriCorps — which the executive branch lacks the authority to do — and prevent the further degradation of Vermont’s workforce and housing,” Clark said in a statement on Tuesday.The funding cuts constitute about 40% of the roughly $6 million Vermont receives annually for AmeriCorps programs, Kolling said. Positions that focus on anti-poverty initiatives and programming for seniors are not impacted by the terminations, he added.READ MORE





 


Vermont Habitat for Humanity programs lose AmeriCorps volunteers after federal cuts

A separate AmeriCorps program, focused on affordable housing and disaster recovery, dismissed its members earlier this month, ending their service terms early and sending them home. SerVermont does not oversee that program.The corps members under the SerVermont umbrella have not been officially let go. “None have been exited from service yet,” Kolling said. “We’re assessing the impacts, and in the meantime, they’re on pause.”AmeriCorps members receive a modest living stipend while they serve. Zajac relies on food stamps and a federally-funded phone program to get by, they said. While they wait to return to work, they’re worried about being able to make rent.“Already, housing can feel impossible to figure out, especially for someone without much means,” they said. “The commitments that I’m in in terms of a lease agreement…I don’t know how I’m going to be able to meet without being able to count on that regular living stipend.”For Jill DeVito, 51, who serves at the Bonnyvale Environmental Education Center in West Brattleboro, the main concern is maintaining health insurance if her teaching position disappears.“Each of us has our own personal lives upended in different ways,” she said.Erin Riley, the AmeriCorps program director for the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, said the pause in service will have an immediate impact on the daily operations of the organizations where members work. But the federal cuts are also emotionally devastating for the dozens of Vermont AmeriCorps members, many of whom have relocated here and have dedicated themselves to giving back to their host communities. “To have that ripped away, I think, is just heartbreaking and, honestly, infuriating,” Riley said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Feds cut more AmeriCorps programs, jeopardizing 200 positions in Vermont.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AmeriCorps_Riley-contributed_043025-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 16:07:16.842236

Data centers are driving near-term energy demand in the region, according to a new regional power forecast from the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. (Rian Dundon/Oregon Capital Chronicle)Demand for electricity in the Northwest could double by 2046, according to a new energy forecast from regional experts.
Over the next two decades, demand could increase by between 1.8% and 3.1% annually, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council heard Tuesday. The projected growth will come primarily from companies building more data centers in the region, more electric vehicles on roads, electrifying buildings, computer chip manufacturing and the production of “green hydrogen” created by running an electrical current through water to split the molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
Idaho doesn’t produce energy like it used to. How drought, renewables are changing our landscape.

Council staff presented the 20-year forecast for electricity demand in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana on Tuesday to the council’s eight, governor-appointed members. Each state’s governor gets to appoint two representatives.
 Energy demand from PNW data centers, EVs expected to drive load growth

“The data centers, naturally in our forecasts, are the very early load growth driver here. They’re the big driver of near term demand,” Steven Simmons, senior energy forecasting analyst, told the council.
Energy demand from data centers and from all electric vehicles in the region are expected to be equal by 2046, and demand from EVs is likely to surpass data center demand after 2046, Simmons said.
Residential and commercial demand, which includes forecasted energy demand for electric vehicle charging at homes and buildings, but does not include data centers, is expected to grow more gradually. Demand for residential and commercial energy in Washington alone will equal the combined demand from those sectors in Oregon, Idaho and Montana during the next two decades.
The energy forecast, part of the council’s forthcoming Ninth Northwest Regional Power Plan to manage demand, does not yet include some possible variables that could reduce future demand, such as improved energy efficiency in cars, buildings and some industries as a response to demand, as well as growing adoption of rooftop solar on residential and commercial buildings.
But rapidly growing demand now means electricity grids in the Northwest and across the U.S. are encountering transmission constraints, and scaling infrastructure to meet demand has been slow due to supply chain delays and issues, staff said.
Council staff expect the biggest growth in data center and computer chip energy demand will occur in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and the Portland and Boise metro areas, based on historical trends and announced projects.
There are more than 100 data centers in Oregon, and there are eight in Iadho, according to the company Data Center Map. There are more than 5,000 data centers throughout the U.S. according to Statista — the most in any country.
Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and X, formerly named Twitter, have massive data centers in eastern Oregon as well as in The Dalles, Hillsboro and Prineville.
 What’s next? Windfarms, solar installations, battery storage and other forms of energy to play a role

To develop its next power plan, the council will evaluate supply side resources, including the potential for more regional windfarms, utility-scale and small-scale solar installations, better battery storage and more geothermal and fracked gas sources, among other options.
The council has published regional power plans about every five years since 1983, to lay out how the region will maintain an affordable and adequate power supply. A draft of the plan, an update from the last one that was published in 2021, is expected to be ready for public review and input by July 2026 and would be finalized by late 2026, according to council spokesperson Peter Jensen.
The Northwest Power and Conservation Council was formed in 1981 following passage of the federal Northwest Power Act. That act directed the four states to work collaboratively on regional energy planning and to stop the decline of native Columbia Basin fish species that have suffered massive population losses over the last century, primarily from the development of hydroelectric dams in the region.
The council members from Idaho are Jeffery Allen, who was appointed to the council by Gov. Brad Little in 2019 after directing its Idaho office for 10 years, and Ed Schriever, the former executive director and longtime employee of Idaho Fish and Game.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek in February appointed two new Oregon representatives to the council: Margaret Hoffmann, of Bend, and Chuck Sams, of Pendleton. Hoffman is the former Oregon director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development program and energy adviser to former Oregon Govs. John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown.
Sams, former executive director of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, was most recently director of the National Park Service. Sams briefly served on the council in 2021 before he was appointed to run the Park Service.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The final priority for the 69th Montana Legislature — one many lawmakers campaigned on — passed both chambers on the final day of the session. 
Property tax relief for residential payers has been top of mind for legislators following historic increases in property values during the last few years, with more anticipated this year, according to Department of Revenue estimates. According to one representative, lawmakers debated at least 47 different bills related to property taxes this session. 
On Wednesday, the House took the final votes on a major property tax bills — House Bill 231 — passing it on a bipartisan basis with 69 representatives voting “aye.” 
The Senate on Tuesday passed HB 231, and a coordinated bill, Senate Bill 542, 28-22 and 29-21, respectively, with one Democrat opposing both bills and the GOP split. 
Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, sponsored HB 231 and was largely seen as the architect behind both bills’ final forms, as well as the state budget, working closely with the governor’s office and coalitions of lawmakers to push the massive pieces of legislation through.
“I came here to have residential, owner dwellings get a tax cut. This bill, in conjunction with 542, does that.” Llew on the floor, adding that he anticipated around 30,000 to 40,000 small businesses would also get a cut.

But many hard-line Republicans, especially in the Senate, decried the property tax bills as complicated and burdensome, and the Legislature still had time to come up with a better plan. 
“It’s unfair. It’s complicated. It’s expensive to implement,” said Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray of the two bills. 
“I’m all for providing property tax relief for residential taxpayers, but not with this bill. As I’ve said, this bill’s unconstitutional, it’s violated our rules,” Sen. Greg Hertz echoed. “There’s better ways to do this, and we can. I’m fine if you just kill this thing and Senate Bill 542, and come back in a special session. We need to get it right, and we’re not getting this right.”
A major sticking point for many detractors was that the bills don’t reduce overall property tax collection in the state, but merely shift the burden between different types of properties, an outcome supporters said is only realistic. 
The relief package contains a homestead exemption — championed by Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, that taxes second homes at a higher rate than owner-occupied homes. To prioritize residential homeowners, other shifts would result in higher taxes for some large businesses and utilities, and the bills were heavily opposed by the Montana Chamber of Commerce and energy and utility companies. 
But Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, said the outrage at the shift in taxes was hypocritical. He said that before the 2023 session, lawmakers received a memo from the Department of Revenue warning them that residential property taxes would increase if they didn’t take action. 
“We did nothing. There was a tax shift,” Flowers said. “In some cases — in my case — my taxes doubled in Gallatin County. Doubled. Where was the outrage on that shift? So there’s outrage now, because apparently the oil refinery is going to pay slightly higher taxes. But what about the shift that occurred in 2023 when our residents saw their taxes jack up? Where was the outrage?” 
“…(Our constituents) didn’t ask us to maintain exactly the same taxes on oil refineries.” 
In the House, Jones echoed the same sentiment, asking where the”scream of anguish” had been when taxes shifted towards residential payers. 
Jones said that when residential properties saw tax spikes upwards of 40%, centrally-assessed properties, like refineries and utilities, saw tens of millions of dollars of decrease.
Meanwhile, the average reduction for a median home value in Montana — $360,000 according to DOR revenue Jones cited — would see a $719 decrease in taxes from the previous year.
“I think that’s significant,” Jones said. 
After the new bills are implemented, those types of properties, and business properties, will still be lower than they were four years ago, Jones said. 
The two final property tax bills saw many changes during the last weeks of the session, including last-minute amendments made to HB 231 on Tuesday morning. 
Jones described the final changes as necessary to coordinate the two bills and ease implementation for the Department of Revenue, preventing delays in seeing results for homeowners. Another change also attempts to address an issue with city charters — namely in Sunburst and Billings — that have fixed mills and could potentially see large increases in property taxes.
The latter issue united many lawmakers from the Billings area — including one Democrat — against the bills, saying they’re “bad bills” for the Yellowstone County area.

But overwhelmingly in both chambers the consensus was that Montanans sent lawmakers to Helena to address high property taxes, with these bills as the best option. 
“It’s not a perfect product. I would posit there is no such thing as a perfect product, because the essence of the property tax relief is that somewhere, somehow, there are going to be tax shifts,” Rep. Dave Bedey, R-Hamilton, said in the House.
Bedey added that the disagreements and fingerpointing between various factions of lawmakers — including a Senate coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans who joined together on major pieces of legislation — prevented the Legislature from delivering property tax bills earlier on in the session, as requested by the governor. 
“Yeah, the cake might have been baked. It should have been baked. We should have had it out the oven earlier,” Bedey said. “And now we’re doing the best we can.”
In the upper chamber, Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, said legislators could go home and be proud of the work they accomplished on property taxes this session. 
An estimated 230,000 to 240,000 homeowners will be impacted by the tax cuts, according to Jones.
“(Those) homeowners will be helped, their rates will go down, their taxes will go down,” Dunwell said. “And you can tell your constituents that will happen.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Capitol_Night-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 16:07:16.842236

In June, a federal grand jury in South Dakota indicted Charles and Heather Maude, of rural Caputa in the western part of the state. The charge was theft of government property. The couple faced possible prison time and fines.
The indictment said the Maudes “did knowingly steal, purloin, and convert to their own use” national grasslands managed by the U.S. Forest Service, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The land in question, according to the indictment, consisted of 25 acres for cultivation and 25 acres for grazing cattle. 
The Maudes have said the prosecution was an overreaction to a property line dispute on land that their family has used for decades.
A federal prosecutor filed for a dismissal of the charges Monday without explanation, and a judge granted the dismissal, following pleas from Republican politicians and officeholders to President Trump’s administration. 
Some of those officeholders gathered with the Maudes on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., for a press conference. Speakers included former South Dakota Governor and current U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and several South Dakota politicians: U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and Gov. Larry Rhoden. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, also spoke.



South Dakota Searchlight reached out to the South Dakota lawmakers’ offices afterward. They did not know the future status of the federal land in question, or the status of the Maudes’ right to use it.
Some of the speakers alleged that the prosecution of the Maudes was politically motivated. The U.S. Department of Agriculture made that claim in a news release Monday, calling the case “a senseless politically motivated prosecution waged by the Biden administration.”
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for South Dakota, which brought the charges, did not respond when asked by South Dakota Searchlight. The U.S. attorney for South Dakota, Alison Ramsdell, was appointed during the Biden administration.
Rollins announced Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched a new complaint portal for farmers and ranchers “who have fallen victim to unfair and politically motivated lawfare originating under the Biden administration” to request an investigation.
Rounds highlighted a bill he’s working on that would establish a mediation process for land boundary disputes between private landowners and the U.S. Forest Service.

(Photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)Utah families struggling with their grocery bill will have a little extra relief this summer, with the “SUN Bucks” program looking to fill the void left by free school meals.  
Once the school year ends, families will be able to get an extra $120 per eligible school-age child to buy groceries. Sometimes called Summer EBT, the program is available for families that already receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits. Families on Medicaid or whose children already qualify for free or reduced school meals are also eligible. 
“SUN Bucks is a federal program to help combat childhood hunger,” said Muris Prses, director of eligibility at the state’s Department of Workforce Services, in a statement. “This is a great way for families to stretch their grocery budget during the summer.”
According to the Utah Food Bank, at least 1 in 8 Utahns, and 1 in 6 children, are food insecure, meaning they lack consistent access to enough food to live a safe and active life. 
That adds up to about 415,000 people in Utah who aren’t sure where their next meal will come from.
Despite opt-outs by GOP states, debut of kids’ summer food program seen as a success

Utah was among 13 states with Republican governors that opted out of the federal program last summer, opposing what they called “welfare” and signaling unwillingness to cover administrative costs. Even with some states choosing not to participate, the program was hailed as a success despite some challenges in its first year.
The Utah Legislature this year passed HB100 requiring that the state join Summer EBT, while also granting free school lunch to any students who qualify for reduced-price meals.
Summer EBT is expected to support an estimated 260,000 Utah children. 
According to data from Feeding America, San Juan County has some of the highest rates among young people, with about 26% of children there experiencing food insecurity — neighboring Garfield County is not far behind, at about 25%. 
With the SUN Bucks program, these families can buy foods like meat, fruit, vegetables, whole grains and dairy products at places that accept SNAP benefits, like grocery stores and farmers markets. The state’s “Double Up Food Bucks” program allows these benefits to earn an extra $2 for every $1 spent on fresh produce. 
Eligible children will be automatically enrolled in the program, according to the state — families whose children attend a school where students already receive a free lunch can apply at the state’s website.
SUN meals is a similar program offering free meals and snacks for school-age children, offering a to-go option for pickup or delivery in rural areas.

The legislation would have restored three words to the current bail bond statute — “a part of” — to allow judges to order defendants to pay percentage bonds to secure their release from pretrial detention, which was removed when the Legislature enacted the Bail Reform Act of 1993.
“All the bill does is add back three words to the code that were taken out a few years ago when we passed a bail reform bill,” England said to the committee during the meeting Wednesday.
The legislation passed the House with bipartisan support on April 15.
It is one of two bills aimed at changing the state’s bail system, and the only one that the Alabama Bail Bond Association publicly opposed as it made its way through the Legislature.
Chris McNeil, president of the Alabama Bail Bond Association and who owns a bail bond company, suggested that the bill, if enacted, would increase the rates at which defendants failed to appear in court for their cases.
England said that those figures are not a fair comparison.
England filed the same bill during the 2024 legislative session. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the legislation last year but it stalled in the Senate chamber.

But after Shekarchi got an email from a resident of Cranston’s Alpine Estates a month later, he questioned whether his day job might conflict with State House advocacy on a bill aiming to ease local restrictions on subdividing large parcels of land. 
“I thought it would be prudent to ask the Ethics Commission if it was appropriate to vote on the legislation,” Shekarchi said in an email Wednesday.
Good news for Shekarchi: The state ethics panel determined there’s no ethical conflict between his housing bill and his former client, Thomas Casale.
Because the Cranston developer is no longer Shekarchi’s client, there’s no way Shekarchi might benefit from the bill’s passage, concluded an advisory opinion written by the Rhode Island Ethics Commission’s staff. The nine-member panel voted unanimously to accept the opinion Tuesday, with one recusal and one member absent, to approve the staff opinion. 
Shekarchi hasn’t represented Casale since 2021 in his battle with municipal officials to develop a few acres of empty residential land in western Cranston, and has been paid in full by Casale for his work, Shekarchi wrote in his request to the ethics panel. Shekarchi also wrote that he does not anticipate a future business relationship with the developer.
Therefore, Shekarchi is free to discuss, advocate for, and vote on the legislation, according to the ethics opinion.
Shekarchi in a statement Wednesday said he was “pleased” with the ethics panel’s determination.
Shekarchi is one of nine Democratic co-sponsors on the subdivision bill put in by Rep. Cherie Cruz, a Pawtucket Democrat. The legislation had an initial vetting before the House Municipal Government and Housing Committee on March 11, with a slightly amended version advanced out of committee in a vote on March 20.
A floor vote has not been scheduled as of Wednesday, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for House leadership, said.
There is also no Senate companion bill yet.
Shekarchi’s work representing Casale has ended, but the high-profile dispute over residential development is far from over, with an appeal filed by Casale now pending before the state Superior Court, according to news reports.
The pending legislation does not specifically name Alpine Estates or his former client, Casale. But if signed into law, the bill could help Casale win the legal battle by easing restrictions on subdividing “oversized lots.”
Casale, who owns an auto body shop in Johnston, declined to comment when reached by phone Wednesday.
“I don’t really have anything to do with that,” he said of the bill before hanging up.
The legislation authorizes municipal zoning officials to grant exceptions to local zoning rules on residential development, including subdivisions, as long as the changes reflect the surrounding neighborhood.
The proposal drew praise from housing advocates, including the Rhode Island Coalition for Housing Providers and Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island, in written comments to the House Municipal Government and Housing Committee. Robert Azar, deputy director of planning and development for the city of Providence, also expressed written support for the intent of the legislation, but suggested a few tweaks.
No one from the city of Cranston or Alpine Estates wrote the House panel regarding the bill. 
Cranston city planning staff initially agreed to the requested zone change, filed in 2019, that would let Casale divide four open lots into eight. However, the City Council initially rejected the zoning change in 2022. After signing a consent order noting that the zone change was consistent with its long-term comprehensive plan, the City Council in 2024 approved a second application for the same zoning change. However, Mayor Ken Hopkins vetoed the council’s approval, and the council failed to garner enough votes to override Hopkins’ veto, sending the dispute back to the courts, where it remains pending, according to news reports. 
Nicholas Hemond, the outside counsel representing the city in the development dispute was not immediately available to comment on Wednesday. Zachary DeLuca, a spokesperson for the mayor’s office, acknowledged but was not immediately able to provide a comment Wednesday.
Christopher Millea, city solicitor, also did not immediately return inquiries for comment. 
Ethics Commission Chairman Lauren Jones recused himself from the commission’s vote Tuesday on the advisory opinion for Shekarchi. Commissioner Emma Peterson was absent from the meeting.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Starting in the 2025-2026 school year, public Iowa K-12 school districts will be required to set policies that, at minimum, ban the use of cellphones during class time under a law signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds Wednesday.
The ban on cellphones during instructional periods was one of the governor’s top priorities heading into the 2025 legislative session. At a ceremony signing the measure into law, Reynolds said House File 782 will help improve Iowa students’ learning and mental health.
“Smartphones and other digital devices have made information, media and entertainment immediately available at any time, any place, and this level of connectivity has changed the way that we live, learn and communicate,” Reynolds said. “And while the positive impacts are undeniable, we can’t ignore that our phones can also be a source of constant distraction in our daily lives, whether at home or at work or, especially for our kids, at school.”

Reynolds cited a Pew Research Center survey that found 72% of high school teachers say students being distracted by cellphones is a major problem in their classroom. Data also shows policies limiting cellphones and other personal electronic devices have a positive impact on student outcomes, Reynolds said, pointing to statistics on higher grades and lower disciplinary rates at Iowa schools that have already put cellphone policies in place.
The Ottumwa Community School District, which implemented a cellphone ban for the entire school day starting in the current school year, saw a 12% increase in A and B grades and a 60% decrease in failing grades for 8-12 students compared to the first semester of the previous year. Additionally, the district saw a 20% decrease in referrals for behavior issues.
Mike McGrory, superintendent of the Ottumwa Community School District, said “Ottumwa schools this year experienced firsthand how powerful a bell-to-bell cellphone policy can be,” and said the new law will help other schools across the district see improved learning and engagement with students.
“The results, as the governor was alluding to, far exceeded our expectations,” McGrory said. “They were truly profound … by eliminating those learning distractions for our students, it allowed the following three things: (for) our students to refocus on their learning, focus on their mental health, and also — this is so important — with building meaningful face-to-face relationships with each other.”
The Ottumwa school district’s policy of no cellphone use for the entire school day is a higher standard than what would be required under the new law. School boards are required to set a ban on cellphone use during class times by July 1, but have discretion on whether to restrict devices during other periods of the school day. The Iowa Department of Education is required to develop and distribute a model policy for use as boards develop their own policies.
The law requires that cellphone bans include exceptions, such as for students who are English Second Language (ESL) learners or who have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan that involves accommodations using a cellphone or other personal electronic device. Parents will also be allowed to petition a school district for their child to retain access of their cellphone during class periods, if they establish a “legitimate” reason related to a student’s mental or physical health that requires the device to be readily available.
Gabe Polich, a senior at Des Moines Hoover High School, also spoke on the measure, saying that he has seen improved grades as a result of not using his cellphone in class. Hoover High School implemented a ban on cellphones during class at the beginning of the 2024-2025 school year, which Reynolds said resulted in a 14% increase in A and B grades, a 12% decrease in students’ failure rate and decrease of out-of-school suspensions by 60%.
Polich said he is less distracted in class and that students are happier in school because of the ban.
“I wasn’t happy they were taking away our cellphones,” Polich said. “But now I can see that it’s really improved our school.”
Reynolds joked “my grandchildren weren’t very happy with me either” when she brought up the school cellphone ban, but that the measure will help other students like Polich learn and be more engaged in schools with the policy in place.
The governor said she believes the policy will help Iowa schools and students while including important provisions addressing concerns about students’ lack of access to phones. This includes the provisions allowing exceptions, as well as requiring schools update their safety and emergency plans, with guidance from the state departments of Education and Public Safety, to account for communications needs during these situations.
Reynolds also thanked lawmakers for their efforts getting the bill to her desk, saying she was happy to see it pass through the Legislature with bipartisan support.
“I think it’s a great example of how we can come together to support simple, common sense solutions that can make an overwhelmingly positive difference,” Reynolds said.

Despite her mounting health challenges, Susan took pride in keeping her check book balanced, and her bedside table stacked high with books.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Susan Rankin.","Born Sept. 8, 1948Hiram, MaineDied Jan. 3, 2025St. Johnsbury, VermontDetails of servicesThere will be a party in remembrance of Susan on Sat. June 7th 3pm in Peacham. To attend please contact Bess O’Brien at bobrien@pshift.com. A remembrance of Susan Rankin by Jasper CravenOn a perfect summer day in late August of 2022, I met Susan Rankin on the bank of the Passumpsic River, in St. Johnsbury. It was the first I’d seen her since the pandemic and we caught up for hours, seated at a picnic table with pizza from Kingdom Crust. I’d brought my then-new girlfriend, Lauren, on Susan’s insistence, even though the reason for our gathering was somewhat grim. We were supposed to discuss her obituary.Susan was then in her early 70s, and for much of her life she’d been sick. Shortly after she moved to Vermont, in the mid 1980s, she’d been in a bad car accident that left her with a brain injury. In the decades since, she’d struggled mightily with migraines and other comorbidities, yet remained insatiably curious and exceptionally witty. She was also deeply caring.For the first eight years of my life, Susan lived across my driveway, in an apartment she rented from my parents on Old West Road, in West Barnet. During my early childhood, she took care of me a lot. Nominally, she was my baby-sitter, but she always treated me like family. I don’t think she ever charged my parents for her services, nor did she gripe at any last-minute requests for care.I was an energetic flower child, prone to bursts of wild dancing in the nude and other forms of joyful chaos. Susan handled me with patience, letting my wild side thrive while also imparting some manners and responsibility. She had me haul things to her shed and help with other chores, but also spoiled me rotten. She read to me, took me to the playground, introduced me to figure skating. She also cooked for me a lot, reminding me at the river that among all the creative dishes she made I was most obsessed with a simple peasant meal: creamed tuna and peas.At Christmas each year, Susan would shower me with presents. But she also tempered my materialism by insisting we purchase presents and wrap them for less fortunate families. She also drilled into me the value of thank you cards — which has served me well through the years.As I grew up, Susan continued to be in my life. She read books to my elementary and middle school classes, picked me up after high school, and called regularly while I was in college. We talked about life, politics, television, and religion.Rarely would she dwell on her own acute medical issues. Instead, she wanted to know how I was doing, an instinct she turned to even during our riverside chat. I was there to learn more about Susan’s life so that, one day, I could properly chronicle it for her obituary. Still, she couldn’t help but spend the majority of our time discussing the particulars of mine, regaling Lauren with many tales of my mischievous youth.As the sun started to set, Lauren and I walked Susan to her car, said goodbye, and went our separate ways. We hadn’t discussed her obituary much, but I assumed we’d carve out another time to do so. We spoke a good deal more after that, but neither of us ever broached the obituary again, hoping, perhaps, that such evasion would forestall the inevitable. Then, on January 3rd 2025, Susan died at the age of 76.Susan P. Rankin was born on September 8th, 1948. She grew up in the rural hamlet of Hiram, Maine, with her parents Albert P. Rankin and Helen E. (Brown) Rankin. She also had a younger brother, Alan.Susan attended at Fryeburg Academy, in Maine, then spent in college before working for about a decade as a medical secretary. At age 30, Susan heard the call of the ministry.Susan then served at several churches under the umbrella of the United Church of Christ, a socially liberal mainline Protestant denomination with New England roots. Its flock came to encompass three of Susan’s favorite politicians: Barack Obama, Howard Dean, and Jim Douglas.In 1982, Susan served as the Interim Pastor at a church in North Haven — one of the Maine’s most remote islands, with a wintertime population of just 400. At the end of that year, she was appointed Associate Pastor at the First Congregational Church of Old Lyme, Connecticut. A news article announcing Susan’s appointment noted that she would be spending much of her time focused on youth programs. It was this work, she told the paper, that excited her the most.In October 1985, Susan landed as interim pastor at the United Church of Christ, in Greensboro, where she served for a year. She also served as an interim pastor at Hampden Congregational Church in Hampden, Maine. Before the first day of her dream job, settled pastor of the United Church of Strafford, Vermont, she was rear-ended in a motor vehicle accident and suffered a chronic brain injury. At the congregation’s behest, she struggled to serve as best she could until they could call another pastor, but she was never able to serve as a full-time parish minister again.Still, Susan remained active in the Vermont Conference of the United Church of Christ. She served as head of the Nominating Committee, and contributed significantly to the Ministerial Standing Committee, the Department of Mission, and Department of Christian Education.“I sometimes felt that Susan was a modern-day Job,” reflected her former pastor in Barnet, Reverend Howard Gaston. “She had lost so much in her life and yet continued to have a faith that she tried to share with others and for her own life struggles.”He concluded: “I know that like Job, ‘the lord has restored her fortunes and gave her twice as much as she had before’ in God’s loving presence.”Susan spent much of the 1990s volunteering in the community when her health allowed it. She was an active ally and, later, board member, for the Brain Injury Alliance of Vermont. She also helped lead support groups for people with head injuries at her two favorite hospitals: NVRH and Dartmouth-Hitchcock. (She would frequently illustrate for me the caring and humane staff she dealt with in both locales.)Susan’s brain injury made it difficult for her to grasp technology, but she loved keeping in touch with the ones she loved. And so, in the early aughts, she bought a newfangled email machine. Her most frequent pen pal was her brother, Alan, who, in 2004, became homeless in Boston due to a debilitating mental health condition.Alan corresponded with Susan from a computer in the library, which he visited often to check in on the season of his beloved Boston Red Sox. Like Susan, Alan was uncommonly kind and tender despite his struggles. He was quieter than she was, but nonetheless caring.Alan was often resistant to Susan’s help, though she convinced him to visit once a year or so for a “vacation” marked by hot showers, good food, and fun outings. Later the family of my close friend, Ezra Racine, offered Alan a job at Eagle Eye Farm, a residential care facility near Lake Willoughby.He worked there until his physical and mental health became too compromised to continue. Eagle Eye Farm helped Alan for months after he ceased to be their employee. The whole Alexander family — particularly John, the patriarch — was extremely kind and generous.Susan tirelessly coordinated efforts to keep Alan housed and cared for. After he had a stroke, she also expertly coordinated his care. Susan participated in the National Alliance on Mental Illness Family Support Group while Alan was alive. After he passed, in November 2017, she continued to provide support for others. She also wrote his touching obituary, and dusted off her pastoral skills to plan his funeral.The pandemic hit Susan hard. She was hoping to start a grief support group for people who had lost loved ones, but her own health was deteriorating. Among other things, she developed a tremor that interfered with her ability to use an iPad for video conferencing into meetings for the Brain Injury Alliance. “Susan was an advocate who tirelessly gave her support and unwavering resolve to make Vermont a better place for the brain injury community,” the organization recently stated.Despite her mounting health challenges, Susan took pride in keeping her check book balanced, and her bedside table stacked high with books. She loved to read, especially memoirs and biographies. She also subscribed to, and read, many magazines. If she caught wind that I was writing for a new publication, she would often subscribe to it. Once, when one of these publications didn’t pay me for months, she angrily canceled her subscription. I often joked that her voracious reading habits were single-handedly keeping my industry alive.I last saw Susan a few days before Christmas on a short stay in a rehabilitation facility. She was clearly weak physically, but maintained the funny spark I’d come to adore.She told my mother and me about the strangest new turn in her health struggles: hearing the same Christmas song play incessantly in her hand. She told it in her classic way, finding humor and resilience in an objectively terrible situation.Not long after, Susan returned home and died of natural causes in her own home, as she had wished.Susan is predeceased by her parents, her brother, Alan, her dog Clooney to whom she was devoted, and many dear friends. She is survived by close friends she considered family, including me, my folks, Kathy Gale, Betty Keller, Bob Hawes, Allyson Crawford, Jeanne Eisner, and her old neighbors on Old West.There will be a party in remembrance of Susan on Sat. June 7th in Peacham.Please contact Bess O’Brien at bobrien@pshift.com to attend.Donations in Susan’s memory may be made to Doctors without Borders and/or Brain Injury Alliance of Vermont.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Susan Rankin.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Obit-placeholder.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 15:12:31.307644

Matt Little, who is running for Congress in the 2nd Congressional District. Campaign photo. Former DFL state Sen. Matt Little is running for the U.S. House in Minnesota’s 2nd Congressional District, the seat soon to be vacated by U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who is running for Senate. 
Little, a resident of New Market Township, is a personal injury attorney and the former mayor of Lakeville. He is the first candidate to officially launch a campaign for the 2nd District, though businessman and internet poster Mike Norton is also exploring a run. Other potential candidates include state Sens. Erin Maye Quade and Matt Klein; GOP state Sen. Eric Pratt; 2024 GOP nominee Joe Teirab; and 2020 and 2022 GOP nominee Tyler Kistner.
“I’m running for every underdog out there, for every person working their tail off, chasing the American Dream,” Little said in a press release announcing his candidacy. “But, unless Washington D.C. wakes up, that dream will never be reality for many people. Groceries, child care, health care, assisted living, you name it — people are struggling to figure out how to pay for basics and have something left over.”
Little served two terms as mayor of Lakeville, then represented the area in the state Senate from 2016 until 2020, when he lost his re-election race to Republican Sen. Zach Duckworth. As a senator, he worked on prescription drug affordability, infrastructure funding and expanding Metro Mobility to his district.
Little was known as a forward-thinking DFL campaigner, aggressively employing TikTok and other novel ways of reaching voters before it became commonplace. 
The 2nd District, in the south Twin Cities metro, has been purple for the past decade, though Craig won by more than 13 percentage points in 2024. Craig has succeeded in the district as a moderate, splitting with the Democratic Party on issues like immigration and law enforcement. 
In the press release announcing his candidacy, Little touted his investments in public safety as mayor of Lakeville. Once, as a city council member, he offered to donate half of his small salary — around $4,000 — to offset the cost of adding a staff position to the police department. 
“I’m fighting for the health care my Mom needs, the retirement my Dad earned, and the future my daughter deserves,” Little said. “I’m running because if we don’t win back Congress, there will be nothing left of our country for my daughter to inherit.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mattlittle-1024x644.jpg,,,2025-04-30 15:12:31.307644

In lieu of flowers, gifts can be made to the Vermont Foodbank or to Vermont Public.Betsy Ann Berry passed peacefully on April 19, 2025 at her home in South Burlington, VT, in the loving presence of her two children.She was born in Montclair NJ, the only daughter of John N Berry II and Marian Chase Berry. Her early childhood was spent in New Hampshire and on her family ranch in Burney, in Northern California, where her most cherished childhood memories were forged. For the rest of her life she enjoyed a fondness for California poppies and the vast open land and wild terrain that expanded to the striking profile of Mount Shasta — a vision that forever captivated her imagination. Following her family’s return to New Hampshire, Betsy attended Wheelock College in Boston, where she received her Bachelor’s Degree in Education. She married and had two children, raising them in Burlington, VT as a member of the University of Vermont community, with her then-husband, Professor Garrison Nelson. She was a kindergarten teacher at Williston Central School for nearly 20 years, and over the years she enjoyed reconnecting with many of her former students who fondly recall their experience in Betsy’s kindergarten. She was a mentor to education students and student teachers at the University of Vermont. Later in her career, she served as an advisor to the Lily Foundation, providing grants that funded groundbreaking research and innovative programs in early childhood education throughout the U.S.She was both a writer and appreciator of the written word, particularly enjoying the poetry of Mary Oliver and Wisława Szymborska, the spiritual writings of Eknath Easwaran and Eckhart Tolle, as well as the poetry of her childhood friend of 75 years, Pat Whitney of Sunapee, NH.

Measles cases in Kansas jumped from 37 to 46 over the past week, with all cases located in southwest counties, according to Kansas Department of Health and Environment data released Wednesday […]","Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group, spoke recently at a University of Kansas Health System panel, addressing concerns about the measles outbreak. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from KU Health video)TOPEKA — New legislation may make it more difficult for public health officials to manage a measles outbreak, which has increased by nine cases.
Measles cases in Kansas jumped from 37 to 46 over the past week, with all cases located in southwest counties, according to Kansas Department of Health and Environment data released Wednesday morning.
KDHE spokeswoman Jill Bronaugh said the state agency is working with local health departments to communicate about measles and to educate the public.
But the Legislature’s passage of Senate Bill 29 may complicate the ability of local health officials to react to the increasing number of measles cases. This bill removed the ability of local health officials to ban public gatherings during infectious disease outbreaks and added the expectation that health officials show probable cause if they quarantine or isolate individuals during an outbreak.
The bill says those who are quarantined can file a civil lawsuit that must be heard within 72 hours if they believe the decision was unjust. Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed the bill, but the Republican-led Legislature overturned her veto.
“Taking away the authority of public health officials to prohibit public gatherings and issue quarantines, when necessary, contradicts effective, evidence-based health intervention advice, but we will do all we can to protect the health of the communities we are entrusted to serve,” Bronaugh said.
Sen. Bill Clifford, a Republican ophthalmologist from Garden City, expressed concern during hearings that not all cases of measles are being reported.
“This weekend I spoke to several pediatricians. In an affected family, one member is going in,” he said, speaking at a time when there were 31 reported measles cases. “In fact, they won’t allow them in the pediatric clinic. We have well babies there and we don’t want to infect them. That one family member is the signal case of what’s going on in the family, and the families are not coming in.”
 
Latest data
KDHE updated its measles dashboard Wednesday morning to highlight the number of cases and the affected counties: Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton and Stevens. In addition, it shows vaccination data, which indicates that 39 people with measles were unvaccinated, one did not have age-appropriate vaccinations, three did not have verified vaccination status and three were age-appropriately vaccinated.
One person has been hospitalized.
Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Kansas Health System, said fully vaccinated people can get the disease, but typically have fewer complications and overall less severity of illness. With one dose of the vaccine, people have 93% protection from measles, and after two doses, 97% protection, he said.
 
How we got here
Measles was considered eliminated in 2000 but has since popped up throughout the United States, typically in unvaccinated communities. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group, joined a panel of University of Kansas Health System experts to talk about how we got to where we are today and to address vaccine skepticism.
Poland explained what it means to eliminate a disease.
“You need a robust surveillance system. You need to know are you seeing cases, and are they measles,” he said. “Then what you have to have is documentation of interruption of indigenous transmission for at least 12 months. We are very likely going to lose that, and that is a real shame because achieving that in 2000 was a monumental public health achievement.”
Indigenous transmission refers to the spread of a disease within a population and is not coming from contact that began with someone outside the community, such as during a trip abroad.
 
Side effects of vaccination
Poland said the vaccine that has been available since 1968 is “well documented to be protective and to have minimal side effects.”
“It always bothers me when people say, ‘Well, isn’t natural immunity better.’ Before there was a measles vaccine in the U.S., essentially every child got it, so three to four million people a year. Forty-eight thousand of those kids ended up sick enough that they were hospitalized, 1,000 of them developed encephalitis, and 500 of them on average each year died. That’s what natural immunity gets you,” Poland said.
Side effects of the vaccine are a few cases of low platelets, transient fever and possibly a rash, he said.
No known deaths related to the MMR vaccine given to healthy people have been reported, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Rare cases of deaths from vaccine side effects among children are connected to those who are immune compromised, and it is recommended they not get the vaccine.
 
Distrust of science
Unfortunately, Hawkinson said, times have changed in terms of how much people listen to medical professionals and how they assess scientific research. Right now is different than in 2019, when the most recent measles outbreak occurred.
“There are major points and reasons why this is much different,” he said. “I think it is in the context of extreme disinformation and misinformation and mistrust of medicine and public health. Mistrust of science. We have to get back to knowing and understanding what is true, but it is just so difficult out there.”
Hawkinson pointed to an overall decreased willingness to listen to and adhere to medical guidance and recommendations.
“We don’t do that when we listen to our plumbers, our mechanics, our lawyers,” he said.
And, he said, overall vaccination rates have declined.
“Many areas locally here in Kansas and Missouri are down to 90% (of people vaccinated),” he said. “You will only see more patients developing this disease and, unfortunately, the complications that come along with it.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PolandScreenshot-1024x579.jpg,,,2025-04-30 15:12:31.307644

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America” passed in a last-minute scheduled committee meeting that lasted just over three minutes.
HB 247, sponsored by Rep. David Standridge, R-Hayden, previously failed to pass the Senate County and Municipal Committee Tuesday after Sen. Jay Hovey, R-Auburn, voted against the measure, resulting in a 4-4 tie. He said in the meeting he had an issue with the fiscal note when he voted against the bill, and he didn’t know it would end up in a tie.
With only Republican senators present at the meeting, the bill passed on a 6-0 vote.
“We’re in the middle of the waning days of our session and still have a lot of unfinished business. We got a significant education package of bills still out there looming. We just passed a lovely set of tax reform, tax relief bills in a committee earlier, so we still had a lot on our plate,” Hovey said, adding that he didn’t think it was a high priority bill.

The bill’s fiscal note states it would increase “administrative obligations” of state and local governments, but it does not state the amount. Hovey said Wednesday that he has “been assured” that it would “affect the state’s coffers minimally.”
“And so, I do have the opportunity to change my vote, and I would like to call for that vote,” he said.
The legislation, which passed the House on April 18, would have also mandated that reasonable efforts be made to update pre-existing resources, unless it imposes an operational or financial burden on the entities. An exception allowed the term “Gulf of Mexico” to be used in academic instruction for historical purposes in public K-12 schools and institutions of higher education.
The National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico announced plans to change its name to the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf in response to the bill and President Donald Trump’s executive order.
The bill moves to the Senate.

(Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)Public school districts have about three months to develop phone-free policies for students, an initiative passed during the recent legislative session and signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham this month.
Senate Bill 11, sponsored by Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte), requires all New Mexico school districts and charter schools to develop rules for students’ use during instructional time of cell phones, smart watches, tablets, laptops and gaming devices in an effort to limit distractions and improve student performance.
“This bill isn’t just about test scores. It’s about showing our kids that we care enough about their future to take practical steps forward when we can,” Brantley said in a written statement. “Reducing distractions helps not only academic outcomes but also our students’ mental health, safety, and focus.”
According to the bill, districts have until Aug. 1 to create and implement a “wireless communication device policy.” The bill also states that the Public Education Department will provide districts with guidelines for minimum policy requirements, and outlines possible requirements such as: limiting device usage during instructional hours; allowing teachers to grant students permission to use devices during instructional time; allowing students to use devices in emergency situations or for accessibility needs; and establishing consequences for violating the policy.
Lujan Grisham signed the bill on April 10, ahead of the April 11 deadline she had for taking action on legislation passed by the Legislature and sent to her desk. In a legislative message, Lujan Grisham described SB11 as a “first step towards meaningful regulation” of electronic devices in New Mexico schools. However, she called out lawmakers for amending the original bill and making participation in creating policies optional for districts. 
“The Legislature squirmed out of taking a meaningful step to improve education under the auspice[s] of local control,” Lujan Grisham wrote. “That is all well and good until this same body blames the Public Education Department—and now the local bodies—for poor educational outcomes of New Mexico students. I once again encourage the Legislature to hold local school districts accountable for educational outcomes. Our students deserve it.”
Kelly Jameson, director of communications for Las Cruces Public Schools, told Source NM in a written statement that the district supports the “intent of SB11 to create safer, more focused learning environments for all students.” She added that the LCPS Board of Education adopted a policy in 2009 concerning the use of electronic communication devices in school. The policy notes that having a device in school is “a privilege” that can be taken away.
The LCPS board also adopted a regulation in 2023 that outlines by grade level when students may use devices during the school day. For example, elementary students may only use devices before or after school. Middle school students may use their devices during lunch periods, but not during passing periods between classes and regulations for high school students are more lenient. 
Violating the LCPS policy can mean devices are confiscated; devices must be left in the school’s front office during the school day; or other disciplinary actions are taken with multiple violations.

File photo by Mike Dougherty/VTDiggerBENNINGTON — A jury convicted Max Misch in Bennington Superior criminal court after a one-day trial on Tuesday for two misdemeanor charges of illegal possession of high-capacity firearm magazines. A previously self-professed white nationalist, Misch had a central role in the racial harassment of a former Bennington representative. The case against Misch, 42, of Bennington, went before a jury after a Vermont Superior Court judge denied Misch’s previous attempts to challenge the charges on grounds that Vermont’s magazine restrictions were unconstitutional earlier this year. In 2018, the Vermont Legislature passed an update of the state’s firearm law, placing a 10 round limit on long guns and a 15 round limit on handguns. Gov. Phil Scott signed the provision into law, and it took effect Oct. 1, 2018. Two 30-round magazines for an AR-15 style rifle were seized from Misch’s apartment after a search warrant was obtained by Vermont State Police on Feb. 6, 2019, according to a state’s witness, James Wright, a detective sergeant with the state police.Misch’s ex-wife Lisa Shapiro testified that she drove him across state lines to New Hampshire on Dec. 1, 2018 — two months after the firearm law took effect — where he acquired the magazines and brought them back to his residence in Bennington. Shapiro said Misch used her debit card for the purchase of the magazines because Misch forgot his wallet. The duo had travelled to the sporting goods store in New Hampshire earlier in 2018 to purchase magazines, but Shapiro said the store was out of stock of the product Misch wanted at the time. Misch placed an order for the magazines to be purchased at a later date, but during her testimony Shapiro could not recall the exact date the order was placed.In the defense’s closing argument, public defender Fred Bragdon claimed that Misch and Shapiro should have “joint possession” of the magazines since they were purchased under Shapiro’s name and she helped transport Misch. READ MORE





 


Judge upholds state’s high-capacity firearm magazine ban in case against white nationalist

Bragdon claimed that because Shapiro could not definitively recall the date Misch placed the order, Misch could have sought the magazines before Oct. 1, 2018, the date of the law’s effect. For that reason, Bragdon claimed that there is a reasonable doubt to whether Misch’s possession of the magazines would constitute an offense under the timeline of the statute. In his closing arguments, Franklin Paulino, the attorney representing the State of Vermont, said that the evidence submitted by the state met the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Misch was guilty of possessing two high-capacity magazines.Once both the state and the defense rested their cases, the jury delivered a guilty verdict for both charges after deliberating for less than a half hour. Misch’s sentencing hearing is expected to be scheduled within the next 60 days, and the court has 45 days for post-trial motions. The presiding judge, Jennifer Barrett ordered Misch be released pending the sentence for the two charges, which each carry a potential maximum penalty for one year in prison and a $500 fine. In an interview after the trial, Misch said that he was disappointed by the result and planned to appeal. Even though he said any jail time he would receive through sentencing would likely be minimal, Misch said he was seeking a “moral victory” that was thwarted by the jury verdict Tuesday. An honorably discharged Iraq war veteran, Misch said in an interview he previously self-identified as a white nationalist but now considers himself a follower of Jesus Christ. Misch has faced several charges in the past, including aggravated domestic assault, a hate crime charge of disorderly conduct and repeated violations of his conditions of release. Misch also previously admitted to engaging in racial harassment and trolling against former Vermont state representative from Bennington, Kiah Morris. Morris was the only Black woman in the legislative body at the time and eventually resigned, in part, due to online attacks. The defense also cited the duplicity doctrine in the beginning of the trial, a constitutional provision that asserts that it is impermissible for states to divide a single offense into multiple counts. While the current statute places a charge on possession of each singular large capacity ammunition feeding device, the defense co-council lawyer Jeff Rubin said that the purchase of the two magazines in one transaction should be considered a single offense. Barrett said the court found the two charges are not duplicitous based on a “plain reading” of the statute, but the court would consider further discussion of the doctrine’s relevance to the case if the defense filed a post-trial brief on the matter after the conviction. Attorney General Charity Clark expressed gratitude to those involved in the conclusion of the jury verdict, which began six years earlier in February of 2019. “I want to thank the jury for their service in carefully considering the law and facts in this case,” Attorney General Clark wrote in a statement. “I also want to thank our law enforcement partners for their assistance with the investigation, whose work was instrumental in bringing this case to a successful resolution.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Max Misch found guilty for possession of high-capacity gun magazines.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/max-misch-2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 15:12:31.307644

Photo by Getty Images.Minnesota Republicans held a press conference last week claiming that a program allowing undocumented people to receive free or discounted health insurance would cost the state over $600 million over four years.
State data show the figure is a wild exaggeration, however. 
The Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2023 made undocumented immigrants eligible for MinnesotaCare — the state’s health insurance program for the working poor — as of Jan. 1, 2025.
Nearly 17,400 undocumented people have enrolled in MinnesotaCare. The program is fee-for-service, meaning the state only pays claims after services are administered.
The Department of Health in a statement said it had 3,378 claims for service, costing Minnesota about $3.3 million as of April 1 during the first quarter. The state budget office projects the cost for the next four years would be around $200 million — or one-third the GOP estimate. 
As for now, MDH says per-enrollee spending is below projections.
“The number of enrollees is currently higher than what was expected, however the amount spent per person is currently lower than what was originally expected,” a department spokesperson said. MDH cautioned that one quarter is not enough data to reliably predict expenditures for the next four years.
What is MinnesotaCare?
MinnesotaCare was created in 1992 to help close the gap in coverage for low-income families who make more than the income threshold for Medicaid, which is called Medical Assistance in Minnesota.
Uninsured Minnesotans who are not eligible for Medical Assistance and have an income at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines can qualify for MinnesotaCare. This applies for undocumented people as well, as of Jan. 1.
Some MinnesotaCare enrollees pay a monthly premium, and the program is funded by a combination of payments from the state, taxes on hospitals and other health care providers and enrollee premium payments.
Under the expansion, many undocumented people receiving MinnesotaCare pay a monthly premium, similar to other residents who receive health care through the program. The premium is based on income and the number of family members in the household. If a person fails to pay the premium, their coverage is canceled.
The federal government kicks in money to pay for MinnesotaCare, but not the portion for undocumented people. 
Minnesota hospital leaders have publicly supported expanding insurance access because it increases the number of paying patients and encourages people to seek preventative care before ailments become more costly, like if they were to seek emergency services.
Federal law requires hospitals to care for all patients who walk through their doors, regardless of whether they are able to pay or their immigration status. The Minnesota Hospital Association has said that revoking MinnesotaCare for undocumented people could make such care more expensive for hospitals across the state.
“Such a change won’t block health care for undocumented immigrants,” the Minnesota Hospital Association said in a February social media post.
Republicans are opposed to the program and have made cutting it one of their top priorities this session. 
“It’s wrong when a person takes an oath of office to serve their constituents and to help them, but they instead prioritize illegal immigrants over their law-abiding constituents,” said Rep. Jeff Backer, R-Browns Valley and co-chair of the Health finance committee, at a press conference last week.
Sen. Alice Mann, DFL-Edina and chief author of the 2023 MinnesotaCare expansion bill, said Republicans have lied to Minnesotans about the program. 
“Republicans are telling you that if we take away people’s health care, that’s gonna fix the problem. Those are absolute lies, and it was egregious what they said. They are taking our crumbling health care system and they’re blaming it on immigrants,” Mann said at a rally last week.
Leaders of the Health Finance and Policy Committee are deadlocked in budget negotiations, in part over the MinnesotaCare issue.
The Legislature is scheduled to adjourn May 19 and must pass a budget by June 30 or face a government shutdown.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/health-insurance-form-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-04-30 14:11:22.092590

At a giant dirt lot off a side road in Emmet County, the air smells sharply of pine. Enormous piles of logs and branches sit around the property.
Terry and Nancy Chamberlin drag pine branches out of the bed of a black pickup truck and a small trailer — trees from their five-acre property in Alanson.
“We got hit real hard on this. We went out here — I think this is our 10th double trip down here in three days — and we’re just having a ball doing this,” Terry said. “And then I can start in the woods, which is going to take me two years to clean up.”
Debris from a massive ice storm at the end of March was strewn across the region. A lot of it fell on power lines, causing widespread outages.
But now, the same debris that knocked out the power a few weeks ago could be used to make electricity.
 ‘Doing the best that we can’

Utilities worked to clear much of the debris from power lines, and it was up to local emergency management teams and road commissions to figure out what to do with debris piling up around right of ways along the road and on private land.
So some set up these drop off sites, where people can bring branches and trees that were damaged or destroyed by the ice.
Lindsey Walker, who works in outreach for Emmet County Recycling, said they were able to pivot to accepting wooden debris pretty quickly. Usually, a company will come through to grind wood people drop off at the county’s waste facility into wood chips.
“We have to justify mobilizing these very expensive grinders and haulers of this material. And so every two years, we’re normally grinding our wood waste,” she said. “We need to have about 5,000 cubic yards on the ground at any time, and now we’ve got about 10 times the amount of that.”
Some established drop-off sites have been open around the clock, receiving debris by truck, trailer and even dump trucks.
“Having sites that are free and ample space for the public to bring debris is really important,” Walker said. “So this site has plenty of capacity for further debris, and then once we get that material ground, then we’re hauling, and so there’s this process of cleaning up sites as they go along. This is like us doing the best that we can with the resources that we have.”

 Turning heat into light

Some of the woody debris might go to places like landscaping businesses to use as mulch. But they’re also selling it to biomass facilities nearby, which will turn that into energy.
“I like to use the little saying that we were green before green was cool,” said Thomas Clift, the director of biomass operations at NorthStar Clean Energy, a company that runs four such facilities, including one in Grayling. “We’ve been in the renewable power business for a long time.”
NorthStar is one of the companies buying and burning that wooden debris from the storm. It uses that to create electricity. In all, the facility powers up to 38,000 homes. It works with another company, AJD Forest Products, to source and organize deliveries.
“All wood is graded by different levels,” he said. “Biomass levels are really looking at the [British thermal unit] of the wood. If it’s a higher quality BTU product they’ll pay more because it will burn better.”
Clift said they’re not cutting down trees for wood to produce that power.
“Any wood product that we use here was either going to be left on the forest floor, to turn into methane and be released on its own, or it’s other materials that would have gone to the landfill,” he said.
Dealing with forest management and debris after natural disasters is something other areas of the country have been trying to figure out as well, such as places in the southeast hit by Hurricane Helene.
But officials say this is an unusual issue in northern Michigan, which hasn’t typically faced the same kinds of disasters. Having biomass facilities in the region make dealing with debris in this way easier.
 Not a new idea

Biomass refers to a range of fuels, from animal manure to trash to wood. Using biomass for energy has a long history. For instance, in the United States residue from wood pulp manufacturing has been a popular source of fuel for electricity over the decades, though that has declined, said Brent Sohngen, a professor at Ohio State University who studies the economics of forestry.
The relationship between biomass-fueled energy and climate is far from straightforward.
Public health researchers and environmental groups have raised alarms about biomass for years, pointing to pollution from facilities, health issues and harm to nearby communities, which are often communities of color or low-income communities, according to advocates. Critics say framing of biomass energy as better for the climate is misleading; it can rely on logging, and burning matter like wood also emits greenhouse gases. And some argue the focus should instead be on cleaner forms of energy, such as solar.
There are situations where biomass-fueled energy will emit more carbon than it saves, Sohngen said — for instance, logging old growth trees for fuel. But in circumstances like the ice storm, biomass could be considered a carbon-neutral energy option, because that wooden debris would otherwise decompose over time, emitting greenhouse gases.
“The nice thing about taking that material and using it for electricity is that it creates electricity, and if you’re creating extra units of electricity from that material, then you’re potentially offsetting some other source of electricity on the system on the grid,” such as coal, he said.
Removing woody debris from the landscape to burn for electricity poses other issues. One example: Dead and dying trees provide a wide range of benefits that should be considered before removing them.
“There’s huge numbers of bugs that will basically use that wood material for growing themselves, and there’s animals or birds or other kinds of things that’ll use the bugs for their own life cycle,” said Sohngen. “It’s really important that, you know, we can’t just take all of the dead material out of a forest and expect a forest to function well.”
There may also be an increasing interest in biochar following disasters like Helene, he said. Biochar is an almost pure form of carbon made from heating up materials like plant matter, and can be spread out in farm fields or forests.
“What we found is that this biochar material has such a long life that it’s a way to lock up a lot of carbon in the forest system for many, many years — millennia, even,” he said.
At another drop-off site in Emmet County, Lindsey Walker walked around yet another mound of logs and branches. Biochar is on her mind as well.
“We rank it by highest and best use,” she said of dealing with the debris. “In my world of worlds, we would be making biochar out of this, because biochar has such value for composting operations, for water filtration, for sequestering PFAS. I mean, the opportunities for biochar are endless.”
But such operations aren’t an option right now, she said, so they turned to biomass and other uses, like mulch for landscaping.
For now, some debris drop-off sites will be open until things slow down, though others are closing.
Local governments are asking people not to leave wood along right-of-ways. It’s also been a dry spring so far, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources recommends that people check on burn permits and conditions in their area.
The timber industry is facing a glut of wood following the storm. One Cheboygan road commission official told IPR they reached out to people in the industry to ask about selling the wood they’re collecting at sites. The only reply they’ve received so far came from a lobbying group, which said the wood chip market is flooded.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2437-min-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 14:11:22.092590

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)A North Carolina House committee advanced nearly a dozen bills in a two-hour session Tuesday afternoon as the General Assembly nears the crossover deadline for bills to pass at least one chamber of the legislature.
Many of the bills approved by the House Judiciary 2 Committee touched on controversial issues and drew concerns from members of advocacy groups during public comment, with bills prohibiting homeless encampments and requiring parents to be informed about minors’ health care garnering extended discussion.
Several of the passed proposals focused on criminal punishment and the state’s capacity for retributive justice. Lawmakers voted in favor of a bill that would once again allow for death by firing squad and electric chair in North Carolina with the aim of resuming death row executions that have been under effective moratorium since 2006.
Undocumented immigrants were a particular focus of Tuesday’s meeting, with the committee voting in favor of one bill aimed at increasing the level of felony convictions when the defendant is in the United States without authorization and another directing health and housing agencies, social services, and public universities to verify individuals’ immigration status.
The flurry of bills owes to the upcoming General Assembly crossover deadline of May 8. Bills that do not pass either the House or the Senate by that point are formally required to wait until 2027 for renewed consideration, though in practice, legislative maneuvers allow some bills to bypass this deadline.
The death penalty
The Judiciary 2 Committee advanced a proposal with the goal of bypassing the two-decade pause on executions in North Carolina, allowing death row inmates a choice between a firing squad, electrocution, and chemical injection.
House Bill 270 would repeal a section of the law abolishing the use of the electric chair and again make this the default method of execution in North Carolina, with inmates having the option to request one of the other two methods instead. The state banned the use of electrocution for capital punishment in 1998, and has executed no one since 2006, with the use of the death penalty postponed by lawsuits over the method of execution as well as racial bias in sentencing.
The proposal comes four years after South Carolina passed a similar bill reviving the use of the electric chair and firing squad, citing an inability for prisons to obtain the chemicals used for lethal injection. While that bill led to further legal challenges over whether these two methods of execution constituted cruel and unusual punishment, the South Carolina Supreme Court ultimately upheld their use in 2024, allowing executions to resume after a decade-plus pause.

“We know that there are court cases out there that are pending. Those court cases have been frozen in place for the last, you know, close to 20 years,” said Rep. David Willis (R-Union), a lead sponsor of the bill. “It’s time for these cases to be moved forward, either through resolution by action of this body or through the courts themselves.”
The move comes months after former Gov. Roy Cooper granted the most death sentence commutations in state history, converting 15 into life sentences. With the understanding that executions might resume in the near future, advocates pushed Cooper’s administration heavily to commute all death sentences in the state.
It’s unclear whether the additional execution methods would have an immediate impact on the unofficial moratorium. While the pause initially took effect because the state medical board barred doctors from participating in lethal injections, the Supreme Court struck down that prohibition in 2009. Since then, legal challenges have centered on objections under the Racial Justice Act, with death row inmates alleging racial bias in their convictions — a claim a Johnston County judge affirmed in February for Hasson Bacote, who received a commutation from Cooper.
In his pitch for the bill, Willis took aim at Cooper and other North Carolina leaders for enabling the pause on the death penalty. “We’ve seen no support from our attorney general. We’ve seen no support from our previous two governors. And it’s time for action on this,” he said.
  Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) (photo: ncleg.gov)
In a statement prior to the vote, Noel Nickle, the executive director of the North Carolina Center for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, said the additional execution methods would only cause harm to the officials asked to carry them out.
“It forces our already overburdened state employees to carry out executions using violent methods we know will be extraordinarily damaging to their mental health,” she wrote.
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) condemned lawmakers for advancing this bill at the same time the Senate was moving to end support for the state’s Innocence Inquiry Commission in its budget proposal.
“My heart goes out to those families who have lost someone and are watching the appeals go on and on,” Budd said. “But if we make a mistake and we take another person’s life, then twice we have committed a wrong.”
Concealed carry
The committee also approved a bill creating a “lifetime” concealed carry program and permitting schools to store less-than-lethal weapons like tasers and pepper spray for self-defense.
House Bill 674, titled the “Firearms Liberty Act,” creates lifetime permits to carry concealed firearms separate from the state’s existing five-year permits, allowing them to remain in effect indefinitely unless revoked by the state or surrendered by the gun owner.
  Rep. Jay Adams (photo: ncleg.gov)
Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) said the lifetime permit would have the same background check, educational, and training requirements as the state’s current temporary permits, and holders would need to notify their local sheriff’s department of any change of address. Unlike the temporary permits, the lifetime permits would not have “reciprocity” with other states, meaning they would only be valid for use in North Carolina.
The bill also allows for individuals who are ordered to surrender their guns, such as after incidents of domestic violence, to transfer them to the custody of a licensed firearms dealer while the order remains in effect, rather than with the local sheriff’s department. In what Adams described as a bipartisan element of the bill, gun owners may also enter into a “safety hold” with a licensed firearms dealer, temporarily storing their guns under the shop’s care such as if they are undergoing mental or emotional distress, or if they simply require more secure storage due to a period of absence.
Finally, the proposal would allow schools to keep “defensive devices” in biometric safes for school employees who have completed annual trainings for their use. This does not include guns or other lethal weapons like knives, but allows for the secure storage of tasers, pepper spray, and other less-than-lethal defense implements on school property.
Budd, the Democrat from Mecklenburg County, raised concerns that law enforcement could mistake someone using one of these less-than-lethal weapons as a threat. She also warned that allowing items like tasers and pepper spray on school property could cause a “slippery slope” toward the inclusion of more dangerous weapons in schools.
Susanne Duncan, a former schoolteacher with North Carolinians Against Gun Violence, said he finds the bill “very alarming” during public comment, warning that having more armed individuals in a crisis could add to the danger to students and staff rather than ameliorating it.
“I was once caught in a riot in a school of 4,000 students. I was pinned against a wall,” Duncan said. “I can tell you, if people had come running down that hall with tasers or with pepper spray or with guns, there would have been dozens of children and staff injured. It would have been a very dangerous situation.”
Immigration bills
Two bills advanced by the committee targeted undocumented immigrants, including a bill increasing criminal penalties if they commit felonies and a requirement for various state agencies to vet immigration status in the course of their public work.
The first, House Bill 261, raises the level of a felony conviction for any defendant previously found guilty of a crime related to reentry after removal by immigration authorities. It also enhances sentences for committing felonies and misdemeanors while conspiring to promote or further criminal activity among all defendants.
Lead sponsor Rep. Neal Jackson (R-Moore) said his local district attorney had requested the bill. The goal, he said, was to send a message that people cannot “come to North Carolina and commit serious crimes” or they will face greater consequences. “The effect of this bill will be that a person who is here illegally in the country and commits a crime will be guilty of a felony that is one step higher than what they were initially convicted for,” he said.
Mark Swallow, an advocate with Democracy Out Loud, said he believes the bill is “likely unconstitutional.” He argued that any requirement to increase felony status based on immigration status would violate the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, and federal civil rights laws. He noted that sentence enhancements targeting noncitizens had previously been found unconstitutional in federal court.
Sammy Salkin, a policy analyst with the ACLU of North Carolina, denounced the proposal as a “cruel attack on immigrant communities.”
“Penalizing individuals differently for the same offense based on their immigration status sets a dangerous precedent and raises significant equal protection concerns,” Salkin said. “Punishment should reflect the nature of the crime, not the immigration status of the accused.”
Chuck Spahos, general counsel for the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys, which backed the bill, said it was important to note the provision does not apply to all undocumented immigrants, only those with a prior conviction for a reentry offense. This, he said, means the law does not discern based on immigration status but instead on prior criminal record.
The second bill passed by the committee concerning immigration was House Bill 690, the “Citizens Support Act.” That bill directs the state Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Commerce, housing agencies, state public universities, and the unemployment service to vet immigration status before providing benefits and social services to North Carolina residents.
Jackson, who also sponsored this bill, said the goal is to ensure that state benefits are “provided only to U.S. citizens and noncitizens who are legally authorized to reside in the United States.” His co-sponsor, Rep. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson), said the verification measures were necessary as “accountability for tax holders’ dollars.”
Rep. Ya Liu (D-Wake) suggested that in emergency situations, such verification processes could prove life-threatening.
“So, say if a patient is very ill and actively dying in front of a hospital, a state-funded hospital, so the doctors will have to check their immigration status to verify if they are a legal resident before they render any treatments?” she asked.
Balkcom said food, emergency services, and life-saving care are exempted for protection under federal law and so would not be affected by the new proposed verification requirements.
Salkin, the ACLU analyst, warned that the new restrictions could deter mixed-status families from seeking benefits for children who are U.S. citizens. “This is likely to reduce benefit use among U.S. citizens and lawfully present immigrants. We urge you to vote no,” she said.
The sentence enhancement bill is scheduled before the House of Representatives for a floor vote Wednesday afternoon. The Citizens Support Act, Firearms Liberty Act, and death penalty bill all advance to the Committee on State and Local Government for further deliberation.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3140930-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 14:11:22.092590

Her organization is suing Missouri, arguing the state's parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions are unconstitutional (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).A reproductive health care nonprofit filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to overturn Missouri’s law requiring minors to get parental approval before getting an abortion.
The lawsuit contends the consent law is unconstitutional after voters passed an abortion rights amendment last year. Right By You, a nonprofit that helps young people navigate pregnancy decisions, including by increasing access to and awareness around contraceptives, prenatal care, abortion, parenting and adoption, filed the lawsuit in Jackson County Circuit Court
Missouri’s parental consent law, which remains on the books, requires that a minor attempting to access abortion receive at least one parent’s consent. The other parent must also be notified. If that’s not possible, they can also seek out a judicial bypass process.
Right By You is also challenging Missouri’s ban on aiding or assisting a minor seeking an abortion. 
“The laws bully pregnant young people without parental support into giving birth and threaten legal action against and undermine the core activities of Good Samaritans who seek to help young people effectuate their own decisions about their pregnancies with dignity,” the lawsuit reads.
Missourians in November narrowly voted to enshrine the right to reproductive health care, including abortion, in the state constitution. That language, known during the election as Amendment 3, includes a provision that prohibits the government from discriminating “against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care or assisting another person in doing so.” 
The amendment does allow the government to legislate abortion access if compelling governmental interest exists. 
The current parental consent requirements and ban on assisting minors seeking an abortion “enhance the information, guidance or support (young people) receive,” but does “disregard, burden and punish young people’s decision to end a pregnancy,” the lawsuit reads.
Abortion returns to Columbia, opening access for mid-Missouri for first time since 2018

Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, said most young people do involve a parent or trusted adult in conversations about abortion. It’s those who can’t whom she worries most about.
“It makes sense that folks that are in healthy relationships with their children have this instinct that they would want their children to come to them, but a law that forces that to happen in every case is not the solution to that problem, because it’s not possible for a law to legislate a healthy family dynamic.” she said. 
The impact of the law, Kraft Sheley said, is “not actually on the young person that you’re imagining who has a good relationship with their parent, it’s on a young person who’s very safety and well being would be compromised by having this conversation with a parent.”
Right By You is asking the court to strike down the parental consent law and to allow the group to begin funding and arranging logistics for minors seeking abortions, including transportation, hotel and child care costs. 
“Young people are shooting this really narrow gap, and then they’re navigating this obstacle course that’s just traumatic and harmful and doesn’t provide any corresponding benefit to them,” Kraft Sheley said. “I see it play out with a lot of confusion, a lot of turmoil, and in some cases, I see young people not able to access care.”
The state of Missouri and Attorney General Andrew Bailey are named as defendants in the lawsuit, as is the Jackson County prosecutor, who is being sued as a representative of the prosecutors across Missouri. 
A separate lawsuit challenging several of Missouri’s other laws regulating abortion is also playing out in Jackson County. The day after the November election, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the same defendants on similar grounds, arguing current targeted regulation of abortion provider laws were unconstitutional under Amendment 3. 
A judge temporarily struck down most of the TRAP laws, allowing some abortions to resume in Missouri. The full trial is set for early 2026. 
Meanwhile, Bailey is also suing Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which oversees clinics in Kansas City and Columbia, over allegations that the organization is transporting minors out of state for abortions. 
The lawsuit is based on a video filmed more than a year ago at the Kansas City clinic. In the recording, a man secretly taped an interaction for Project Veritas in which he pretended to be the uncle of a 13-year-old in need of an abortion whose parents couldn’t know. 
Planned Parenthood staff then directed him to their affiliate clinics in Kansas where they said he could “bypass” parental consent. When the man asked how often girls go out of state for abortions, the Planned Parenthood employee said it happens “every day.”
During a court hearing on Monday in Cole County, attorneys for Planned Parenthood argued the lawsuit should be dropped on the grounds that the video was “hypothetical” and that abortion is now legal. 
“I find that the right to reproductive freedom initiative does not address the issue of parental consent,” Boone County Judge J. Hasbrouck Jacobs said Monday. “And because of that, I’m going to deny the motion to dismiss.”
Kraft Sheley is also a co-founder of What’s Next, an Amendment 3 accountability group made up of organizers and activists who previously called for a constitutional amendment to appear on the Missouri ballot with no restrictions on abortion. 
Immediately after Amendment 3 was approved by voters, the coalition started calling on the state’s major reproductive rights groups to challenge Missouri’s parental consent law. 
“They haven’t done so,” Kraft Sheley said. “And we can’t sit and watch those people be left behind.”
The lawsuit also notes that current policy does not clearly state how or if minors in state custody or in the foster care system can access abortion through the current parental consent law.
A Missouri teen spent her life in foster care. Now she’s fighting the state to keep her baby

The Independent recently published a story detailing the journey of a young teenager in foster care who was denied an abortion in 2024 at the age of 15. After the state said abortion wasn’t an option, she spent her pregnancy and postpartum in constant fear of the state removing her baby, despite providing her with practically no resources to help her parent. 
“My fear is we’ll see more cases like (this one,)” which Kraft Sheley described as “my literal fear of what will become of young people who are forced to continue pregnancies. That’s what is proposed by these criminal involvement laws, and that is what this constitutional amendment explicitly disallows.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8628-2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-30 14:11:22.092590

In that role during the first Trump administration, he implemented a policy that required asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases pending in immigration court.Death in custodyThe top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, raised concerns about a 2010 death at a CBP station in San Diego that Scott ran.Anastasio Hernández Rojas was detained by CBP officers where he was beaten and later died from his injuries, Wyden said.Scott was later accused of covering up the death of Hernández Rojas, Wyden said.“Rather than following the agency’s own policy and immediately referring the incident to outside investigators, the San Diego CBP office began its own investigation,” Wyden said. “In the course of that investigation, the CBP officers taped over the only video copy of Hernández Rojas’s death and tampered with physical evidence, according to court documents.”The U.S. paid $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Hernández Rojas’ widow. The U.S. Department of Justice in 2015 declined to pursue federal charges against any of the officers or leaders involved in the Hernández Rojas case.Committee Chair Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho, defended Scott and said that U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote a letter to the committee to inform members that she reviewed the 2010 incident and that Scott’s work “was in accordance with his duties, the law and professional standards.”“Mr. Scott did not impede any investigation, nor did he take steps to conceal facts from investigators,” Crapo said Wednesday.Wyden argued that Noem was not head of DHS in 2010 and that he had spoken to officials who were present at the time of the investigation that took place surrounding Hernández Rojas’ death.“There have been these serious allegations made by the former heads of internal affairs about Mr. Scott's involvement and the cover up of the death of Mr. Hernández Rojas,” he said. “I don't believe this committee should take this letter on faith.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Talk to someone working in the service industry, or education, or any public-facing position, and you’re likely to hear story after story of callousness.
That’s not to say everyday kindness has disappeared altogether, but it is being overwhelmed by its opposites. And because we create our politics and not the other way around, nobody should be surprised by the state of things. Better angels have flown underground, abandoning the surface to an American primordial goop of endemic selfishness, cultivated prejudice, and practiced ignorance. And those are the exact ingredients necessary to conjure and animate somebody like President Donald Trump.
He is an American creation, through and through, inside and out.
Amid Trump’s inevitable era of sweeping cruelty, his supporters can be sorted into two buckets, albeit with some double-dipping. In one there are those who cheer each deportation, termination, and financial strangulation as independent victories in a too-woke world, and in the other are the “Reagan Republicans” who are willing to accept a degree of heavy-handed unpleasantness if it means furthering certain neoliberal aims when it’s all said and done.
Here in New Hampshire, for example, the MAGA bulldogs who serve in various leadership roles in the Legislature are in the first bucket, while Gov. Kelly Ayotte and her predecessor are among those in the second. 
The Democrats, meanwhile, have taken on a shaky dual formation with the shared goal of harm reduction: on one flank is moderation to the extreme (as exemplified by New Hampshire’s congressional delegation) and on the other a full-throated resistance movement calibrated for social media.
I’ve seen enough, in the left’s silence and its misdirected online fury, to say that the right holds no monopoly on callousness. 
Those are, generally speaking, the opposing political currents that we experience either directly or indirectly in our daily lives. But orbiting above all is the power that drives the tides now tossing us about — the force we sense but cannot see.
That American tidal power — and I’m talking about monied strength capable of moving policies and politicians like game pieces — has inflicted countless evils upon the modern world but there are two that stand apart: economic inequality and environmental degradation.
There is nothing about those two outgrowths of corporate and personal greed that should set regular people against each other, yet here we are like clockwork toy soldiers turned by an unseen hand. 
And the billionaires fiddle while Rome burns.      
What I’m saying is that you don’t have to dig very deep to see that America’s biggest divides are not natural divides. Economic inequality isn’t necessarily political nor is it theoretical — it is present in every hospital bill that can’t be paid, in every “For Sale” sign resulting from too-high property taxes, in every printed statement of unconquerable college debt. And if you think the price of environmental degradation isn’t paid by Republicans and Democrats alike then I invite you to read up on Saint-Gobain in Merrimack, Casella in Bethlehem, and the “National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System” in Manchester. Those are inconvenient stories in your backyard, stories that you can see, smell, and be poisoned by, but tell me: Are they “fake news” too?
It’s hard not to be angry today, and it’s harder still to do something meaningful with that anger. 
Over the years, I’ve talked to plenty of people who should be angry but somehow aren’t. One of them was Ellen Groh, who spent almost a decade as the director of the hopefully named Concord Coalition to End Homelessness before she retired in 2022. I’m certain that Ellen wouldn’t remember me or the group conversation we had in a newspaper conference room years back, but I think about that day now and then, and gratefully. She helped me better understand homelessness in the city where I spend so much time, which I’m sure is what she had set out to accomplish. But she also inadvertently taught me something about the limits of politics and policy, and the limitlessness of people. 
You see, we asked her question after question about the problem — its causes, its solutions, and everything in between. She listened with infinite patience and answered thoughtfully, because those were other ways that someone in her position could help. And I felt that more than anything else she was that: somebody who was trying to help. Because somebody has to.
The policy prescriptions we were asking her about mattered — and some of them mattered a whole lot. But whether they came to be or not, it seemed clear to me that the world would always need people like her — the steady ones who hold the broken pieces together, with two weary hands, even as the frenetic crowd bays at the moon.
In this nation governed by tidal powers, unseen but so harshly felt, I know we could use more Ellen Grohs to stand at the waves of fresh need, of new suffering. But things have gotten so far away from us, maybe it’s best to set the bar a little lower: “Don’t be (crappy) to the waiter,” Jason Isbell sings, “he’s had a harder day than you.”
Because I swear to God it’s the callousness that’s killing us. Bit by bit, year by year. And I know in a moment like this, with our politics mercilessly churning real bodies and real lives, that maybe, probably, less callousness isn’t enough. But here’s what else I know: I’ve been on the receiving end of enough kindness to know that it’s not nothing.
And that’s what we always seem to forget here in America: You have to take the first step first.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/barnflag-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-04-30 13:14:42.699398
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-30 17:06:18+00:00,CT Mirror,Clean Slate erasure of CT criminal records to resume in fall 2025,Maysoon Khan | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/clean-slate-erasure-ct-criminal-records-resume/,"After years of delays, CT officials are targeting fall 2025 to resume automatic erasure of most old criminal records under Clean Slate law.","After years of delays, state officials are now targeting fall 2025 to resume the automatic erasure of most old criminal records under Connecticut’s Clean Slate law.
The Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP), which is overseeing the law’s implementation, was approved for $10 million in state bond funding in April to put toward the project.
DESPP Commissioner Ronnell Higgins told lawmakers the funding is crucial for the department to deliver on its promise to erase the criminal records of the estimated 119,000 people in Connecticut who are believed to be eligible.
“Although I am troubled that we have not fully delivered, I can say that under my leadership and with this team, we have put the infrastructure in place to deliver on that promise,” he said.
Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in 2021 signed the Clean Slate law, which requires the state to automatically erase most low-level convictions after a period of time. The measure was seen as a major victory in criminal justice reform.
But it was stymied by ongoing technical challenges. Higgins told lawmakers during a legislative hearing in February that implementing Clean Slate is “likely the most complex IT project that the state of Connecticut has ever taken on.”
The state has missed a series of targets to begin automatic erasures. Most recently, Lamont said in December 2023 that the process to erase the vast majority of eligible records would finish in January 2024. But officials pushed back that deadline, blaming data quality issues and aging computer systems.
Lamont’s office has not responded to requests for comment.
So far, only about 13,000 people have had their criminal records erased, according to DESPP spokesperson Rick Green.
Connecticut Public reviewed hundreds of email messages between Lamont’s staff and managers working on the project, which it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.
Those emails, dated from November 2023 through February 2024, describe conversations that unfolded as the state geared up to fully implement the law, but failed to meet the governor’s stated timeline.
The emails show officials were on the precipice of getting erasures up and running, but discovered yet another category of data quality issues that needed to be fixed.
One of those email exchanges in November 2023 involved a group of high-ranking state officials, including Patrick Hulin, the governor’s deputy policy director; Jonathan Dach, a senior advisor to Lamont; and Marc Pelka, then the undersecretary for criminal justice policy and planning at the Office of Policy and Management.;
“I am frustrated about where we are,” Hulin wrote in a Nov. 21, 2023 message, “but it remains better to fully test the system than to rush it to hit the date the Governor gave last winter.”
The state later hired quality assurance company iLab Consultants to help resolve ongoing technical problems.
Green said the company has been testing and validating Connecticut’s systems to make sure people whose records are eligible for erasure aren’t being missed.
“It involves this cumbersome process of verifying old, flawed, data from computer systems that are 60 years old in some cases,” he said.
DESPP spent $5.8 million on Clean Slate in 2024. The department is expected to spend another $10.8 million this year and through 2026, according to Green. 
Advocates say patience is wearing thin for people who, despite completing their sentences, face hurdles in accessing secure housing, employment and education.
Matt McDermott, a member of Congregations Organized for a New Connecticut, which pushed for the law, said he’s skeptical Connecticut can hit its new target, given the number of deadlines that have already passed. The organization has met with state officials regularly to discuss Clean Slate’s progress.
“It’s extremely frustrating,” McDermott said. “We’ve heard other dates that didn’t prove true.”
Under Clean Slate, the state will erase eligible misdemeanors from people’s criminal records seven years after they complete their sentence, and eligible felony convictions after 10 years. Sex crimes and family violence crimes are not eligible for erasure.
McDermott said he wants to hold state officials accountable, and push them to implement the law as quickly as possible.

(Courtesy of South Dakota Humanities Council)The South Dakota Humanities Council is set to receive at least $200,000 from a national charitable foundation to keep it afloat after the federal government terminated nearly $1 million in grant funding awarded to the organization this year.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in February urging agencies to streamline the federal bureaucracy. The National Endowment for the Humanities, which provides funding to humanities organizations across the country, cited the executive order when it terminated $65 million in grants to all 56 humanities councils across the country and its territories earlier this month.
New York-based Mellon Foundation pledged Tuesday to provide $15 million to be divided among all 56 humanities councils. Each council will receive a minimum of $200,000, though the foundation will donate an extra $50,000 if the council matches that amount in local fundraising, said South Dakota Humanities Council Executive Director Christina Oey.
The nonprofit provides public education in literacy, civics, the arts and culture.
“It’ll allow us to continue going longer than we anticipated,” Oey said of the donation. “It was that light of hope we needed.”
The money will help keep the council’s programs running, including the annual Festival of Books and the Young Readers program. The Young Readers program distributes 15,000 copies of a book to South Dakota third graders each year.

The funding will help pay for shipping of the Young Readers books to schools, and allow this year’s Festival of Books to continue. The festival is planned for Sept. 26-28 in Spearfish.
But the donation is just a fifth of what was lost. The federal funding made up 73% of the council’s overall budget, Oey said.
Mellon Foundation President Elizabeth Alexander said in a news release Tuesday that although the donation won’t cover all the lost funding, she hopes it’ll help councils get by.
“At stake are both the operational integrity of organizations like museums, libraries, historical societies in every single state, as well as the mechanisms to participate in the cultural dynamism and exchange that is a fundamental part of American civic life,” Alexander said.

The University of Mississippi Medical Center’s Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery hosted a free oral, head, and neck cancer screening Wednesday at the Jackson Medical Mall as part of Oral, Head and Neck Cancer Awareness Week.
The event featured quick, noninvasive screenings aimed at catching cancer early — when treatment is most effective. Onyx Care provided free HPV vaccinations, while the ACT Center for Tobacco Treatment, Education, and Research offered resources on smoking cessation and free services.
“These screenings take about 10 minutes and can save lives,” said Dr. Gina Jefferson, head and neck surgical oncologist at UMMC. “The earlier a cancer is diagnosed, the better chance we have of curing it.”
Tobacco and alcohol use remain major risk factors for these cancers. However, physicians say an increasing number of cases are linked to HPV, especially among younger adults with no history of smoking or drinking. Dentists are often the first to spot early signs, which can include persistent sores, lumps in the neck, or difficulty swallowing.

Chung joins former special victims prosecutor Christina Hines, Pontiac Mayor Tim Greimel and Army veteran Alex Hawkins in looking to fill U.S. Rep. John James’ seat in Congress, as James (R-Shelby Township) forgoes a reelection bid to seek the governor’s office.
Chung grew up in Oakland and Macomb County, the son of Vietnamese immigrants, worked as an attorney bringing cases on behalf of children made ill by lead contaminated water and veterans who were denied benefits. 
Chung advised the Senate Judiciary Committee on the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. He also worked with the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice on issues of fairness and opportunity in education, and served as a senior lawyer at the U.S. Department of Commerce to help implement the CHIPS and Science Act, which aimed to bring manufacturing back to the United States. 
“I’m running for Congress to bring back an American Dream where every Michigander can provide for their families, and where the government makes our lives easier, not harder,” Chung said in a statement. 
“I saw firsthand how little Donald Trump and Elon Musk actually care about working Americans.The Trump Administration is gambling away people’s life savings by taking a chainsaw to job creation programs like the one I worked on, along with Social Security, Medicaid and public education. They’re playing games with unhinged shoot-from-the-hip policies. We need new leadership that can push back against their overreach,” Chung said.
If elected, Chung said he would take on the Trump administration when it abuses its power. He also promised to fight for good-paying jobs and lower costs to give all Michiganders a shot at the American dream. 
Michigan’s 10th district runs through Rochester, Rochester Hills and southern Macomb County in Southeast Michigan.

(Jill Hummels for Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Pulitzer Prize winner Edward Larson is convinced building blocks of the Scopes trial — a showdown between human evolutionary biologists and fundamentalists beholden to creationism — remains relevant as activists work to build national political movements long after dust settled in Dayton, Tennessee.
The highly publicized battle in the summer of 1925 between defense attorney Clarence Darrow and prosecutor William Jennings Bryan at the trial of high school teacher John Scopes was an international spectacle. Darrow worked on behalf of the forces of scientific inquiry and champions of the separation of church and state, while Bryan stood with Bible-thumping Christian creationists defending a Tennessee law banning the teaching of evolution in public schools.
Larson, who earned the Pulitzer Prize in history for “Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America’s Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion,” said Tuesday at University of Kansas the 100-year-old drama addressed broad cultural, religious and legal issues of the post-World War I and pre-Depression era.
Larson said the rhetorical style favored by Darrow and honed by Bryan had periodically resurfaced in American politics as folks sought to capture the public’s imagination about the risk of teaching human evolution in classrooms. It’s been a factor in debates about other issues blending politics, law, science and faith, including gay marriage, climate change and cloning, he said.
Moving forward, Larson said, old-fashioned strategy rooted in populism was being used to undermine public health ideas of mass vaccination tamping down disease threats. Robert Kennedy Jr., the antivaccination activist turned secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has challenged effectiveness of vaccines at a moment when the threat of measles escalated. 
“Most people I’m talking to agree it’s not evolution right now. They tend to say it’s the anti-vaccine,” he said. “Another one that could come back is gay marriage. Some states are beginning to play with laws and to test the Supreme Court on that one.”
Despite political maneuvering in a few states, Larson said, the fight over evolution lost some of its luster. In Louisiana and Tennessee, lawmakers sought to skirt constitutional boundaries set by the U.S. Supreme Court to advance legislation promoting religion. The creationist mantra is shrouded in statute urging critical analysis of all sorts of theories, including evolution.
“The 2008 Louisiana law expressly allows local school boards to promote critical thinking. Not only about evolution and the origins of life, but also global warming and human cloning,” he said. “The 2012 Tennessee act goes further by protecting and encouraging critical studies of such controversial scientific theories as evolution, the chemical origins of life, global warming and human cloning.”
Larson, who spoke 25 years ago in Lawrence on the Scopes trial, said a common question was why a small, rural community in southern Tennessee became the focal point of tension between religious fundamentalism and scientific theories regarding evolution.
In part, he said, the courthouse trial was a publicity stunt by locals to generate attention for Dayton.
He said the forum also placed on a legal scale literal interpretations of creationism found in the Bible and fossil evidence discovered by scientists that pointed to evolution of the species. The messaging was so alluring the trial was the first in the United States to be broadcast on national radio.
“The answer was, because this was every town,” he said. “Such actions generate legislation and lawsuits precisely because religion matters in America. Public opinion surveys invariably find that most Americans believe in God. It troubles many Americans that science does not affirm their faith and outrages some when their children’s coursework seems to deny their religious beliefs.”
He said people who embraced diversity often sought middle ground on controversial topics when possible, but the modern era dominated by social media demonstrated people continued to instinctively respond to stirring oratory.
People will be drawn to the likes of Bryan and Darrow when they persuasively delve into prominent issues of the times, he said.
“They tapped into a cultural device that deeply troubles our national house,” Larson said. “If history is any guide, to borrow from the title of Scope’s own memoirs, we remain in the center of the storm.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scopes-trial-100th-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-30 13:14:42.699398

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Former Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo isn’t ruling out a run for president in 2028. 
Asked by David Axelrod during an event Tuesday at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics whether she was considering a top-of-the-ticket campaign in three years, Raimondo answered directly, and succinctly: “yes”
“I care deeply about this country, I’ve dedicated 15 years to public service and if I think there’s a big way for me to serve again including running, I’ll do it,” Raimondo told Axelrod during the live audience event, a clip from which was posted by Axelrod to X.
 “But I also, if I thought somebody else would be better, or better able to win, I’d get behind that person in a minute.”
Her comments come months after she left her job as U.S. Department of Commerce secretary, which she held for nearly four years under former President Joe Biden. Prior to her ascendance to Biden’s cabinet, Raimondo served six years as Rhode Island governor, the first woman in the state’s top leadership role.
A former venture capitalist, Raimondo garnered a reputation for a pragmatic approach and moderate ideology, with a focus on economic development.
The Smithfield native and LaSalle Academy graduate returned to her home state Monday morning to attend the funeral Mass in celebration for the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. In an interview after the Mass, Raimondo confirmed she is still living in D.C., though she plans to return to Rhode Island after her son graduates high school in June.
Since leaving the federal administration in January, Raimondo has joined the Council on Foreign Relations in D.C. as a distinguished fellow and co-chair of a task force on economic security. 
In 2020, her name surfaced on a short list of candidates under consideration to serve as Joe Biden’s vice president, and again in 2024 for the vice president slot on a ticket with Kamala Harris.
Her appearance with Axelrod was billed as a conversation about “all things capital and commerce,” including AI, tariffs and the United States’ economic relationship with China. But Raimondo also addressed the challenges that lie ahead for the Democratic Party to regain control in D.C., along with remarks on the media landscape and higher education, according to news coverage of the event.

In an order issued late Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams wrote that Uthmeier will have to prove that he shouldn’t face legal consequences over his greenlighting of arrests under the law, which she had temporarily blocked as likely unconstitutional.
At issue is an April 23 letter Uthmeier sent to law enforcement declaring that he couldn’t stop them from enforcing first-degree misdemeanor penalties to suspects accused of entering the state as an “unauthorized alien.” The law adds heightened penalties for re-entry.
Tuesday’s order also extends the suspension of enforcement of the law through the remainder of the litigation. The defendants — Uthmeier, plus Florida’s statewide prosecutor and state’s attorneys — almost simultaneously filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
Williams scheduled a hearing to discuss sanctions for May 29 in federal court in Miami.
“Even prior to any formal discovery, there is evidence that AG Uthmeier has used his authority to encourage local law enforcement to continue making arrests under a law the Court has, for the time being, found unconstitutional,” Williams wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Violation of court order
U.S. citizen released from jail after arrest under Florida’s new anti-immigration law

Uthmeier took office as attorney general in February, after Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to fill the vacancy left by predecessor Ashley Moody’s elevation to the U.S. Senate (also by DeSantis). Before becoming the state’s chief legal officer, Uthmeier was DeSantis’ chief of staff.
The class action by the Florida Immigrant Coalition, The Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status came after DeSantis signed the law on Feb. 13.
Williams referred to Uthmeier’s letter as a violation of the court’s temporary restraining order barring enforcement of the illegal entry law, which she originally issued on April 4 and emphasized on April 18 that it applied to law enforcement.
The irritated judge said she found it problematic and was offended by Uthmeier’s April 23 letter, in which he wrote that he believed “no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce Florida’s new illegal entry and reentry laws.”
“Do I need to put a ribbon on it?” Williams asked during a Tuesday afternoon hearing, referring to what more she could do to make her order legitimate.
Even then, Williams said she wouldn’t make Uthmeier sit for a deposition, a request plaintiffs’ attorneys said they have considered as the suit goes on. Although she didn’t discourage plaintiffs from filing a motion to depose Uthmeier, she said his state of mind when writing the letter was clear.
Acting Florida Solicitor General Jeffrey DeSousa told Williams the state viewed Uthmeier’s letter as explaining the position the defendants are arguing in court rather than an invitation to disobey the temporary block on the law. Instead, DeSousa shifted blame for the dispute to the plaintiffs, saying they should also have sued the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Highway Patrol, sheriffs, and police chiefs.
The defendants asked the court on Wednesday to pause the suspension of the law.
“The State would suffer the sovereign harm of having one of its laws enjoined, while continuing to suffer from the effects of illegal immigration,” the defendants’ attorneys wrote in a motion. “Meanwhile, the individual Plaintiffs continue with their violations of federal and state law and the organizational Plaintiffs seek to further that unlawfulness.”
Judge’s rebuttal
Williams pushed back against the defendants’ position that law enforcement isn’t bound by the suspension because they’re not named in the suit and Uthmeier lacks authority to discipline them.
In the order as well as during the hearing, Williams zeroed in on Uthmeier’s posts on X, stating that he had directed FDLE and FHP to monitor protests at Tesla dealerships and FDLE and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to execute a search warrant at a Panama City Beach aquarium.
“Those statements by the party Defendant support a conclusion that he exerts a measure of control over state and local law enforcement agencies’ criminal enforcement efforts, including those related to immigration,” Williams wrote in the order.
Allowing arrests that state prosecutors would be barred from pursuing in court would raise grave constitutional concerns, Williams wrote.
Continued arrests following the suspension of the law had prompted frustration from Williams. In her order, she mentioned the arrest of a U.S. citizen in Leon County.
An FHP trooper arrested Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, on April 16. The case garnered national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reporting of the arrest without probable cause and Lopez-Gomez’s subsequent release from the Leon County Jail.

Iowa Board of Nursing records indicate Brandy Wicks, a registered nurse from Treynor, was working at an unspecified acute care hospital in 2023 when she admitted to pulling controlled and non-controlled medications from the electronic medication dispensing machine and placing the drugs in drawers in patient rooms for administration at a later time.
The board also alleged Wicks pulled a dose of oxycodone out of the medication dispensing machine and documented administering the drug to a patient who later said they never received it.
The board charged Wicks with misappropriating or attempting to misappropriate medications, failing to properly document or perform the disposal of medications, and failing to properly safeguard or secure medications.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
To resolve the case, Wicks recently agreed to a settlement with the board that will allow her to keep her Iowa license, although it we be placed on probationary status for two years.
Records from Nebraska’s Division of Public Health show that Wicks’ ability to practice nursing in that state was revoked in October 2024.
The division alleged Wicks was working for a Council Bluffs hospice agency, St. Croix Hospice, when a patient’s spouse noticed the patient’s morphine pills were missing after Wicks had visited. After the spouse inquired about the missing drugs, Wicks allegedly went back to the patient’s home and returned the drugs, saying they must have fallen off a table unnoticed into her bag.
Eight pills were missing from the patient’s supply after Wicks returned them, according to the division.
In 2023, the division alleges, Wicks was working with patients at Nebraska Medicine’s trauma center when she charted that she had given a patient Oxycodone, which the patient later denied receiving. A subsequent audit allegedly revealed that over 15 days, there were 52 discrepancies in medication records involving 17 patients cared for by Wicks.
According to division records, Wicks was fired from Nebraska Medicine and later failed to appear for a hearing on licensing charges. A hearing officer, Robert E. Harkins, revoked Wicks’ ability to practice in Nebraska, stating that her actions were “serious and constitute a significant risk to public safety.”
The decision was affirmed by the chief medical officer of Nebraska’s Division of Public Health.
Wicks told the Iowa Capital Dispatch she didn’t feel the Nebraska division fairly characterized her actions at the trauma center. “They made it out to sound, like, almost like I was taking the medications — which I was not,” she said. “That was not the case.”
As for the home-hospice client’s missing morphine, Wicks said, “I believe that was a set-up. I think the family took the medication and blamed it on me. I have never taken medications from a patient, ever.”
Wicks said she’s currently dealing with some personal issues, but plans to resume working as a nurse soon, possibly at a nursing home in the western Iowa town of Oakland.
Court records indicate Wicks is currently facing a charge of child endangerment, which, after nine continuances, is scheduled for trial on May 27. A related charge of domestic abuse assault was dismissed and a related charge of violating a no-contact order is currently “on hold,” according to court records, pending the resolution of the child endangerment case.
Iowa, Nebraska boards diverged in previous case
Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Nursing allowed another nurse to keep her licenses after her privileges had been revoked in Nebraska. In that case, the Iowa board charged Kristine Brammer of Clearfield in 2024 with misappropriating medications or property, having her license to practice nursing revoked or suspended by another authority, and unauthorized possession or use of a controlled substance.
The board alleged that while employed as a nurse at an unspecified care facility in May 2023, Brammer failed to complete the required medication counts and that narcotic medications were later found to be missing. While employed at a different care facility in June 2023, Brammer allegedly documented the administration of narcotic pain medications to patients who later denied receiving them.
On Aug. 30, 2023, the State of Nebraska revoked Brammer’s ability to practice there. The Nebraska records indicate that in 2022, she was fired or lost her privileges while working at two separate health care facilities and then failed to report those matters to the state.
In January 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing resolved its 2024 case against Brammer by issuing her a warning and advising her that if she failed to continue her participation in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, she may be subject to further discipline.
Separate board actions
Other nurses recently sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Nursing include:
— Judith Gonzales, an advanced registered nurse practitioner who works in the Des Moines area and is certified as a psychiatric mental health nurse. Gonzales was charged by the Iowa Board of Nursing with engaging in behavior which constitutes unethical conduct or practice harmful or detrimental to the public.
She was also charged with demonstrating professional incompetence by failing to meet state standards related to controlled substances, and committing an act which causes physical, emotional or financial injury to the patient or client.
Recently, the board resolved the case with a settlement agreement with Gonzales. In that agreement, the board says it charged Gonzales with professional boundary violations; prescribing or administering drugs in an unsafe manner by failing to accurately document the action and assess the patient; prescribing or administering drugs to individuals who weren’t patients or who were outside her area of specialty; and committing an act that caused physical, emotional, or financial harm to a patient.
The settlement agreement makes no mention of the charge of professional incompetence.
According to the agreement, Gonzales’ employer, who is not named by the board, received patient complaints that Gonzales was not maintaining proper physical or emotional boundaries with her clients and was oversharing her personal matters in their sessions.
Further investigation subsequently revealed Gonzales had not adequately documented her patient sessions or her prescribing of pharmaceuticals, the board alleges.
The board has placed Gonzales’ license on probation for two years, during which time she must complete three separate six-hour courses on professional boundaries, recordkeeping, and prescribing practices.
— Emma Fedler, a licensed practical nurse from Adel. Board records give conflicting accounts as to when Fedler was first issued an LPN license, with some documents indicating 2013 and some stating 2023. In 2023, Fedler’s license was placed on 12 months of probation after the board charged her with an excessive use of alcohol that might impair her ability to practice nursing. That charge was tied to a criminal conviction for second-offense drunken driving, according to the board.
On April 30, 2024, the board alleges, it received information that Fedler stole her co-worker’s prescribed Adderall and was fired from her place of employment, which the board has not named. The board subsequently charged Fedler with engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum, and being involved in the unauthorized possession or use of a controlled substance.
To settle the case, Fedler has agreed to submit to a multidisciplinary fitness for duty assessment that includes a substance abuse evaluation. Her license will again be placed on probation, this time for two years, and she will be required to submit to chemical screening.

A state board in Oklahoma approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.
The nation’s highest Court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.
Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the Court is expected by the end of June.

The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
Both the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling.
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore. Both contend states cannot exclude certain charter schools from education funding on the basis of religion.
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine, attend Mass and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.
Oklahoma and federal law have long specified that charter schools are public schools. State statute requires charter school programs to be non-sectarian and forbids charter schools from affiliation with a religious institution.
Charter schools are subject to most regulations that apply to traditional public schools in Oklahoma, but they have more flexibility with teaching methods and employee hiring. 
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Attorneys representing St. Isidore and the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, which approved the school in 2023, contend charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. 
Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion, the board and the school’s legal counsel said.
Supporters of the school cited recent rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court that found faith-based private schools can’t be excluded on the basis of religion from receiving government grants or state-funded tuition vouchers.

“The Court has made it clear time and again that you can’t open up a program to private organizations but then say, ‘But we can’t allow religious organizations into that program,’” Phil Sechler, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, told Oklahoma Voice.
Rejecting St. Isidore because of its Catholic faith is religious discrimination, Sechler said.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state, including Gov. Kevin Stitt and state Superintendent Ryan Walters.
Drummond said before the hearing he isn’t worried the Court’s conservative majority will rule against him.
“I think even conservative people such as myself know how to read the Constitution,” he said.
Charter schools are entwined with the government as public schools, Drummond said, so one becoming religious would violate constitutionally required church-state separation.
“St. Isidore, the charter school, would not exist but for the contract (with the state),” Drummond said. “The school is established by the state. The school can be closed by the state. The school must be open to all, free, subject to substantive oversight, subject to state control. This is not a private contractor.”

The attorney general said allowing a Catholic charter school creates a “slippery slope” to any faith group operating a school with state dollars. Oklahoma taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to finance religious schools that contradict their faiths, he said.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court agreed. The state’s justices found charter schools meet the definition of a “state actor” under two tests the U.S. Supreme Court established. 
They decided a charter school is sufficiently entwined with government control and that it provides a “public function” of free public education, a duty the Oklahoma Constitution gives exclusively to the state.

In the absence of federal funding and support, municipalities feel added challenges on their paths to net zero but many chug along with the state’s help in projects to decarbonize buildings, municipal fleets, and put up solar arrays. 
The post How these Massachusetts communities are pushing forward to meet state climate goals  appeared first on CommonWealth[...]","Around 3pm in the afternoon on a Monday, not long after school was dismissed, about forty kids were running around the playground and under the large solar panel awning over the parking lot next to Hosmer Elementary School in Watertown. There were electric vehicle chargers spaced out in the parking lot and a box sat in the back of the school containing battery storage. Out of the windows in one of the science classrooms, parts of the roof are visible and solar arrays line every free square foot. Inside the school, there is a constant hum of fresh air circulating, and the walls of the hallways are decorated with brightly colored infographics that lay out facts about the school’s green features. One reads: “1920 photovoltaic solar panels are located on the school property, which generate close to 800 kWh of energy.”  Hallway in Hosmer Elementary School with infographics about the school. (Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)One can imagine students who are just beginning to learn to read picking up the definitions of “fossil fuel,” “solar power,” and “renewable energy” as they walk through the walls.   Hosmer is one of two net-zero energy elementary schools in Watertown. The school, which has been open for about three years, consumes no more energy than it produces from the solar arrays on its roofs and over its parking lots.  Jess Donato, a third-grade teacher whose children attend Hosmer, said that the building makes the students more conscious of the climate and the environment. Her oldest son, who is now in middle school, still talks about how the school helped him learn to think about the environment and green solutions. He started thinking about “how much energy is being used, and different ideas like solar panels over parking lots. [He asked] why every school isn’t doing this? To him it seems so obvious,” Donato said. Teachers at Watertown’s net-zero Hosmer Elementary School.

(Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)The city is in the process of building yet another net-zero school — this time a high school that is going to incorporate geothermal energy along with solar panels. The high school is set to be built to LEED Platinum 4.0 standards — one of the highest certifications a building can receive for energy efficiency and sustainability. According to Watertown officials, it will be the first high school building in the country to both be net zero and LEED Platinum certified.  Watertown isn’t the only municipality in Massachusetts taking steps — and allocating scarce budget resources — to combat climate change. Cities and towns across state are funding programs to decarbonize their buildings, their municipal fleets, their schools, and contribute to the state’s climate goals. As the average global temperature rises, storms intensify, and droughts disrupt food production — and the federal government rolls back decades of climate policy — there is an added spotlight on these efforts as a way for decarbonization to continue in the state. “We can keep moving forward at the municipal level,” said Amy Boyd, the vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the Environmental Justice League of Massachusetts. “Municipal leaders can be responsive to their community’s concerns and desires to face the climate crisis head on and be ready and do what we can to protect our communities from the worst of it even if at the federal level, they’re rolling back such protections.” But most towns and cities — especially in the absence of a federal partner — remain reliant on the state to make major changes, and the state tends to move at a slow pace.  Massachusetts is a leader in climate policies, but environmentalists say that the state can do more to support municipalities in their efforts to decarbonize. The scale of the funding that the state can provide is much lower than what the federal government can. But as the Trump administration freezes funding for climate initiatives, lays off workers at the Environmental Protection Agency, and stymies offshore wind, the state will have to step in to decide what programs it can fund and what projects must be put on the chopping block.  Solar panels over library parking lot in Newton. (Photo by Laura Colarusso)Watertown, which was one of the first communities in New England to pass an ordinance requiring solar panels on most new buildings larger than 10,000 square feet or containing 10 or more residential units, has been committed to mirroring the state goal of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050. The city has a committee dedicated to environment and energy efficiency that works on pushing for green policies.  “Any city has to decide where they want to put [their] money,” said Jocelyn Tager, a resident of Watertown who has led the push for the city to invest in solar energy. “Some other school could spend $6 million on some fancy gym. And we spent it on solar arrays.” In 2017, the city had three elementary schools that needed to be replaced or renovated. Hosmer and Cuniff elementary schools were rebuilt as net-zero buildings. The third — Lowell School — was upgraded to be more energy efficient. These three projects cost about $170 million and were entirely funded through the city’s budget.  The new high school will cost about $220 million, most of which will be funded by the city, though the Massachusetts School Building Authority will kick in $50 million. The school, set to open in 2026, will serve just under 800 students. The under-construction new Watertown High School which will have solar panels and geothermal on site. (Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)“We have found … that it is a lot easier to convince a small group of local people that this is good thing to do — that our environment is important to us — than it is to convince the state to do something,” said Pat Rathbone, a member of Watertown’s environmental and energy committee. “Massachusetts has very good climate goals, and Massachusetts will do its best to meet them. But this is the kind of thing that you could do in a state … less progressive than Massachusetts. Every single town is able to take a step like this, and our town is enormously proud of these schools.”  Tager emphasized that Watertown isn’t a rich community in comparison to its neighbors but that it has still been able to achieve this major step.  Danvers, a town located in Essex County which has its own municipal-owned electric company, has a project underway to build solar arrays on top of an existing landfill. The system is expected to generate around 3,200 megawatt hours of energy per year — enough to power roughly 1,000 homes and reduce carbon emissions by 2.7 million pounds. The solar arrays are set to be installed sometime in the next two years, and the entire project is estimated to cost the town around $3.6 million.    In the northwestern corner of the state, Williamstown — which is home to Williams College — is building its new fire station with the aim of making it a net-zero carbon facility with onsite solar panels. It’s a part of the town’s goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In Newton, there are solar arrays operating at 19 city-owned parking lots, building rooftops, and a landfill. The city has a plan to add nine more by the end of 2026. Once the new arrays come online, 40 percent of the total electricity municipal buildings use will come from solar. Most of the planned projects will put solar arrays at public schools around the city on roofs and over parking lots.  Newton has pursued several other initiatives like converting its municipal fleet to electric vehicles as of 2022. As of this year, the city has 68 electric vehicles in its fleet program supporting 21 departments.   “Local government efforts in climate action are extremely important right now,” said Caroline Weiss, the climate action coordinator in Newton. “It’s important to continue to work on climate action in times where that’s not happening everywhere in this country. That really can still make a difference and empower residents.” Many towns choose to pursue climate initiatives not just because they are good for the environment but because they save money. Watertown owns the solar arrays on the schools, which means that the city has a locked-in cost of electricity and is therefore not subject to fluctuations in natural gas prices.  “Putting solar panels on a parking lot or on the roof [of a] school saves money for the town,” said Boyd. “That’s not an investment that’s being made just out of altruism or, love for the earth. It’s actually a good fiscal decision that saves money on the town’s power bills, which can then be spent on more books, more police officers, or whatever else the town needs to do.”  Solar arrays over Hosmer Elementary School’s parking lot. (Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)Towns and cities face tradeoffs when choosing to invest in climate initiatives because they often finance projects through their tax base, leaving less money for other priorities as inflation and the uncertainty around tariffs raise costs. And unlike the federal government, local governments can’t run a deficit to make ends meet. In Marblehead, a community on the North Shore, community leaders are also trying to decarbonize municipal buildings but face budget constraints.  In the town, residents have been frustrated that the restrooms have been closed down seasonally due to failing heating equipment. The town has chosen a climate-friendly way to solve this problem: install a heat pump system for the restrooms. The project used money from American Rescue Plan Act funding to put in the heat pump. But other climate projects are difficult for the town to afford. Marblehead has struggled to find the funds for a $13.8 million project to replace the deteriorating seawalls that protect the town from erosion and flooding, both of which are intensifying because of climate change. Town officials were counting on a federal PROTECT grant to fund the project, but that program was canceled. They’re pursuing another federal grant, but there is still uncertainty there on whether the town will get funding. It’s difficult to do climate initiatives with just town funds, according to Logan Casey, the town’s sustainability coordinator.  “Municipalities [are] cash-strapped, and that is very much the situation in Marblehead,” said Casey. “[For] a lot of other municipalities in Massachusetts there isn’t a lot of free cash just flying around ready to pick up for any capital project that you can imagine.” Federal and state funds are crucial to helping the town move forward on its climate goals, Casey added. Massachusetts’ Green Communities Grant program, established through a 2008 law, provides funding to municipalities that want to reduce municipal energy use and costs through clean energy projects. Municipalities must first be designated as a “green community” and pledge to cut municipal energy use by 20 percent over five years, support renewable energy, and promote energy efficiency in municipal buildings and transportation to qualify for the program.  Since 2010, the program has awarded more than $191 million for projects like installing high-efficiency lighting, upgrading energy management systems, and transitioning HVAC systems away from fossil fuels. In March 2025 alone, the state gave more than $7.2 million to cities and towns across Massachusetts to fund clean energy projects. Newton has received a total of $2.2 million in Green Communities grants since 2010 for projects like weatherizing public buildings and installing heat pumps. Weiss said that Green Communities and Mass Save, the state’s energy efficiency program for residential and commercial properties, are some of the biggest drivers of decarbonization in Newton. (Mass Save also offers rebates for converting HVAC systems and appliances to clean energy.)  State programs allow decarbonization to happen on a larger scale than a single community could afford, said Boyd “Larger towns that are able to have a sustainability professional on staff are going to be able to move farther and faster than towns that that can’t afford to have somebody whose whole job is focused on that,” said Boyd. “But every town [can decarbonize] if we can help them with state policies and provide some of the upfront funding … to get over the initial hump of the upfront cost of investment.” Michael Barrett, the Senate chair of the Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy Committee, emphasized the importance of the state providing financial backing to local projects that provide outreach to residents about utilizing the Mass Save program or state funding to decarbonize at the individual level. “There are all kinds of local activities for example that involve nonprofit, volunteer coaching in which somebody retired perhaps from a regular day job, but smart about heat pumps or solar panels participate in a community backed effort to offer advice to residents of the community that want to do the same thing,” said Barrett. “The reason that so many of these programs are appealing to state officials like me is that you get a lot of bang for your buck. [It is a] human capital extender — the effort is being expended by local volunteers with the help of a compensated coordinator or two.” One such program is the PlugIn program, a partnership between Acton, Ashland, Natick, Sudbury, Wayland, Westborough, and Framingham to do outreach to individual households on how to shift away from fossil fuels and transition to electrification. The program focuses on rooftop solar, community solar, and heat pumps. The program is run by the non-profit MassEnergize and has received funding from the Legislature.  Legislators set aside money in the state’s budget for programs like these to help municipalities. However, the environmental community argues that the state can do more to support municipalities in their efforts to decarbonize — especially for environmental justice communities that lack resources — in the absence of federal support. “Municipalities do not have the tools to raise the kind of revenue that they need to do a transition to a clean energy economy,” said Vickash Mohanka, head of the Massachusetts Sierra Club. “We can see that through energy efficiency and Mass Save program. If towns and small cities had to fund their own version of Mass Save, we wouldn’t have any energy efficiency in the state basically. It would be extremely difficult…So having the state step in is a necessary tool.”  Municipally-owned cars in Newton charging in the Newton City Hall parking lot. (Photo by Laura Colarusso)Local governments aren’t just limited by their lack of funds. In some cases, they require approval from the Legislature to take steps to decarbonize. For example, municipalities cannot adopt an ordinance that requires all new buildings or major renovation projects to be fossil fuel-free unless the Legislature approves it. This is a policy that many towns and cities across Massachusetts have wanted to adopt, but the state does not allow municipalities to regulate or restrict the use of fossil fuels in construction.  In 2022, the Legislature launched a pilot program that allows up to 10 communities to adopt such a policy. The communities are: Arlington, Newton, Acton, Aquinnah, Brookline, Cambridge, Concord, Lincoln, Lexington, and Northampton. The program is supposed to serve as a demonstration program for a fossil-fuel free mandate for new buildings.  The roll out has been slow for the program with communities getting approved nearly two years after the law passed. There are many communities including Salem, Boston, and Somerville that wanted to be a part of the program but couldn’t. Environmentalists say that the pilot program needs to be expanded. “The Legislature must act with urgency to facilitate the expansion of this program and allow an equitable adoption of this opt-in program so that more diverse communities are able to achieve cleaner air quality, along with lower construction and operational building costs,” said Lisa Cunningham, a co-founder of advocacy group ZeroCarbonMA. Municipalities have led the push on adopting strict emissions reduction standards for existing larger buildings through “BERDO,” or the Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure initiative. The policy sets declining emissions standards for larger buildings and sets fines for buildings that don’t comply.   Boston, Cambridge, and Newton have all adopted versions of BERDO with their own schedules for compliance. For Boston, the first compliance window began in 2025, and the city has created a fund aimed at supporting projects to reduce building emissions, especially for “communities disproportionately impacted by air pollution.” Watertown is in the process of drafting a BERDO ordinance. According to Boyd, communities like Boston adopting BERDO can serve as an example of a success story that other communities and the state can learn from. But outside of ordinances like BERDO, the energy profile of buildings is still largely regulated through state standards.  “There are other ways besides grants that state aid is hugely helpful to municipalities,” said Ann Berwick, the co-director of climate and sustainability in Newton. “Cities and towns can’t adopt their own building codes. So the state plays an important role in promulgating progressive building codes.” Another way that towns and cities have sought to green their energy portfolios is by setting up municipal aggregation programs. A municipality can negotiate a competitive rate for electricity pricing on behalf of the residents and businesses within a community and they can set how much of the energy mix is provided by renewable sources. These arrangements have been around in the state since 2000, but more recently, municipalities have begun to choose increasing amounts of renewable energy content. There are 199 municipal aggregation programs with around 1.27 million customers enrolled in them across the state, as of January 2024. The biggest one is in Boston where residents are automatically enrolled in a program that has 42 percent renewable energy unless they opt out. (Newton, for example, has a much higher base option of 95 percent renewables in which residents are automatically enrolled.) The cost of electricity through the Boston program is currently higher than the rate offered by the local utility company but given the fluctuations in fossil fuel-based energy, there are times when the negotiated price is lower than the rate offered by the utility company. The Department of Public Utilities is tasked with approving each municipal aggregation program and that has led to years-long delays for municipalities seeking approval. The state has made the approval process easier by creating a template and guidelines for municipalities to follow. That has reduced the delay significantly, according to Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance.  The country is entering a new era of federal climate policy where funding for decarbonization and mitigation programs is being frozen as the Trump administration rolls back state-level rules and other protections designed to avoid the worst of climate change.  Towns and cities are doing the best they can to decarbonize but they are looking to the state for more funding, more guidance, and more permission to be aggressive in their climate goals. The state’s climate chief, Melissa Hoffer, emphasized that a partnership between communities and the state will be crucial to meet the current moment.  “It’s not only important to think about individual projects in municipalities, but to think about how [we] can coordinate efforts across districts,” said Hoffer. “Instead of one-off projects and one-off planning, how can we coordinate that to address that risk and better coordinate the capital that is available…We’re in a capital-constrained environment now.” The question on many environmentalists’ minds is whether the Legislature will meet the moment.  “The [Massachusetts] Legislature definitely is [slow],” said Gandbhir. “I appreciate all the work that they’ve done so far, but there’s definitely a need of a jump start. There’s a lack of transparency with the Legislature and… that can really cause a loss of perspective and a loss of sight over what we really need to accomplish. There’s a lot that needs to be done moving forward, and we do really need to pick up the pace.” Sen. Jamie Eldridge, who sponsored the funding for the PlugIn program and has pushed for drought management policies and a plastic bag ban, said the Legislature can do more for municipalities. “The state certainly needs to step up and we need to pass a very robust climate bill, perhaps [with] more state incentives for electric vehicles, battery storage, [and] solar panels,” said Eldridge. “What are we doing to make it easier to put up solar, given the Trump administration’s hostility to offshore wind?” Eldridge is pushing this session for a bill that would create a climate change superfund that would collect money from companies that are responsible for the more greenhouse gas emissions to fund resilience and adaptation projects in communities that are most impacted by climate change. “It’s reasonable whether it’s going after multinational corporations or finding some progressive tax to find a dedicated revenue source to do climate projects, whether it’s energy efficiency, solar, geothermal [or to] help communities hire sustainability managers,” Eldridge said.  Barrett, the state senator from Lexington, added a note of hope for local efforts even in the face of federal hostility to climate policies. “When it comes to climate initiatives, Trump is torching the field,” said Barrett. “He is riding roughshod over the crop and really putting it to ruin, but he’s not really destroying the root system of the climate movement. We’ve got lots of local activists with [some] state and local government help available to preserve the … climate movements — the root system. We can keep things healthy and going even though he’s doing a lot of damage on the surface. … The more localized climate action is, the less likely is it that Trump can reach it and damage it.” The post How these Massachusetts communities are pushing forward to meet state climate goals  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HosmerOutFront-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Lawmakers gave wide final approval Wednesday to two measures designed to shrink the state’s looming budget deficit by $136 million.
The two bills are Legislative Bill 650, from State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, related to trimming business incentives, and LB 645, from State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, related to scaling back school retirement contributions based on how well funded the pension plan is. 
LB 650 passed 40-7. LB 645 passed 45-2.
Tax incentives pared back
LB 650 from von Gillern, who chairs the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, would reduce or defund various tax incentives with savings this biennium, including:

Buyer-based exemption for construction contractors to purchase materials tax-free if appointed to do so by a client ($12.9 million).
Credit for retailers collecting sales taxes (reduced, $11.7 million savings).
Renewable Chemical Production Tax Credit Act for local businesses producing renewable chemicals (defunded after 2025, $8.5 million savings).
Nebraska Relocation Incentive Act offering tax incentives for relocation expenses (reduced, $8 million savings).
Nebraska Advantage Rural Development Act for individuals or companies that increase economic activities intended to benefit rural Nebraska (reduced, $6.8 million savings).
Nebraska Biodiesel Tax Credit Act for retail dealers who sell and dispense biodiesel at a taxpayer’s retail gas station (reduced, $1 million savings).
Creating High Impact Economic Futures (CHIEF) Act for charitable contributions to community assistance or services helping to alleviate areas of chronic economic distress (defunded after 2025, $900,000 savings).
Nebraska Shortline Rail Modernization Act to offset railroad infrastructure maintenance and capital improvements for Class III railroads (reduced, $500,000 savings).
Food donation income tax credit for grocery stores, restaurants or agricultural producers that donate food to a food bank, food pantry or food rescue (defunded after 2025, $500,000 savings).
Cast and Crew Nebraska Act for qualifying film companies, productions and actors (defunded after 2025, $500,000 savings).
Reverse Osmosis System Tax Credit Act for the one-time installation of a reverse osmosis system at a taxpayer’s primary residence (reduced, $250,000 savings).
Urban Redevelopment Act designed to grow small businesses and generate investment in Nebraska’s urban cores (defunded after 2025, $101,000 savings).

School retirement changes
LB 645 from Ballard, who chairs the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee, would reduce annual contributions to the state’s school retirement pension plan — for all employees outside Omaha Public Schools, who have a separate retirement plan — depending on the actuarial funding level of the pension plan. The school plan is currently 99.91% funded.
The state currently gives 2% of statewide payroll for employees covered under the plan. School employees contribute 9.78% of their monthly payroll, while school districts match that at 9.88% of the eligible employees in their district.
  The following represents the scaling retirement contribution rates that would be in place under an amended LB 645 proposed by State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln. (Courtesy of Sen. Beau Ballard)
Under the amended LB 645, contribution rates would change each July 1 for all three groups depending on whether the plan is:

Less than 96% funded (employees 9.75%, employers 9.85%, state 2%).
Between 96% and 98% funded (employees 8.75%, employers 8.84%, state 0.7%).
Between 98% and 100% funded (employees 8%, employers 8.08%, state 0.7%).
100% funded or more (employees 7.25%, employers 7.32%, state 0%).

Multiple senators said the tiered system could offer a “cushion” in hard economic times. 
Teachers and other school employees could see an immediate take-home pay increase, and school districts could have a property tax reduction. However, if the plan’s funding level falls, closing the gap would fall back to the state, employees and school districts.
Ballard, at the urging of State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, earlier this week put in language to LB 645 protecting the state’s continued contributions of 2% of payroll for Omaha Public Schools employees to the separate district retirement plan each year. That amendment also said it isn’t the Legislature’s intent to pick up “any financial responsibility or liability” for the OPS pension, which the state now manages.
Budget impacts
With the passage of LB 650 and LB 645, and with Gov. Jim Pillen’s expected support — he included both measures in his January budget proposal — the state’s projected budget deficit would fall by $136 million. The state also would save $187.24 million in the following two-year budget cycle, based on current projections.
Lawmakers still would need to find $259.4 million over the next two weeks to balance the budget and meet a statutorily required reserve limit, according to estimates from the Legislative Fiscal Office.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., hopes to put the entire package on the floor for a vote before the Memorial Day recess begins.Nearly every one of the chamber’s 220 GOP lawmakers will need to vote to approve the 11-bill package in order to send it to the Senate, where Republicans will likely make changes to the legislation.The first three markups included some of the less controversial aspects of the package for Republicans, including plans to increase spending on defense by $150 billion, a $70 billion boost to border security funding and an overhaul of federal student loans and Pell grants.Homeland Security Chairman Mark E. Green, R-Tenn., wrote in a statement that GOP lawmakers on the panel ""advanced funding to give Border Patrol agents the tools they have long requested to accomplish their homeland security mission in the field while protecting our communities.”“Conversely, the actions of our colleagues across the aisle today proved what the American people have known for some time,” Green wrote. “Democrats would rather advocate for a radical, open-borders agenda than for the safety of their own constituents, or the CBP personnel who suffered through a historic border crisis under the Biden-Harris administration.”The panel voted 18-14 along party lines to approve the bill. Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., wrote in a statement after his panel approved its bill that the measures ""not only would save taxpayers over $350 billion but also bring much-needed reform in three key areas: simplified loan repayment, streamlined student loan options, and accountability for students and taxpayers.""""I’m proud of the Committee’s work today to finally stand up and end the status quo of endless borrowing,” Walberg wrote.That panel voted 21-14 along party lines to approve its bill.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., wrote the defense funding increase would ensure “that our national defense remains the strongest in the world and supports an agile and modern fighting force.”That committee voted 35-21 to advance its bill, with five Democrats — Don Davis of North Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine, Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, Eugene Vindman of Virginia and George Whitesides of California — voting with all committee Republicans in favor.House committees are expected to release bills next week showing how Republicans plan to extend the 2017 GOP tax law as well as how they plan to cut federal funding on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, program.",,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

(Getty Images)Voters in Morgantown have narrowly rejected repealing an ordinance prohibiting homeless people from sleeping on the streets and in other public areas. 
The city voted 982 to 904 Tuesday in favor of not repealing the camping ban. The election results are unofficial until a canvas takes place May 5, the city said in a news release. 
The law, which is so far not yet in effect, prohibits camping on any public property — including streets, parks and trails — and also prohibits storing personal property in public areas. Second and third violations of the law are punishable by fines of $200 and $300 and/or 30 days in jail, respectively.
Council passed the ordinance in September. After that, the Morgantown Coalition for Housing Action successfully petitioned to have it repealed or put on the ballot. Council chose to put it on the ballot rather than repealing it. 
Proponents of the law have said homeless people sleeping in public areas is a health and safety issue.
Councilwoman Louise “Weez” Michael, who proposed the ordinance, said in a statement Wednesday she appreciates the trust of the community placed in council by supporting the ordinance. 
“This decision reflects our dedication to maintaining public safety and enhancing the quality of life for all residents,” she said. “We remain committed to working collaboratively with various stakeholders to ensure that our policies are effective and compassionate, addressing the needs of both our unsheltered population and the broader community.”
Opponents of the laws say camping bans do nothing to address the causes of homelessness and can make it worse by imposing fines and criminal penalties that make it harder for people to get into housing. 
They also point out that the city does not have enough resources for homeless people who want shelter. Morgantown has 54 year-round emergency shelter beds and another 21 beds when the winter shelter is open — not enough to accommodate the 100 homeless people identified during the 2024 point in time count. 
Councilman Brian Butcher, a homeless service provider, said Wednesday he’s very disappointed in the election results.
“[I’m] hopeful that the folks who said that this would spur them to create more resources actually do that now,” he said in a text message. 
Dozens of cities around the country have prohibited public camping after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar camping ban in Grants Pass, Oregon, amid record levels of homelessness. 
During the most recent legislative session, Del. Geno Chiarelli, a Republican who represents Monongolia County, introduced a bill that would have implemented a camping ban statewide. The bill passed in the House of Delegates but not in the Senate. 
“I was pleased, but not surprised to see Morgantown voters spoke at the ballot box yesterday to maintain a ban on individuals using our public property as camp sites,” Chiarelli said in a statement Wednesday. “I know this is an important safety issue in other parts of the state, which is why I plan to introduce my bill to ban urban camping again next year during the regular legislative session.”

When he called his dad and told him he was on suicide watch, his father started to cry.
During a previous facility inspection, a licensing specialist from the Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice (OJJ) reported that the jail failed to “identify youth who may be at risk of suicide or who may need prompt mental health services.”
OJJ licensing specialists visited the jail multiple times between July and February and found the facility violated state regulations 83 times. The Appeal also received reports for an additional 11 juvenile detention facilities inspected during the same period. Jackson Parish had more violations than the combined total of those facilities and almost 12 times more than the second-worst lock-up.
The Jackson Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Office of Juvenile Justice did not answer a list of questions sent by The Appeal.

Inspectors detailed numerous violations of the kids’ rights. In February, an OJJ inspector reported that the Jackson Parish Jail “failed to ensure the youth are available for the minimum minutes in a school day as required by law.”
During multiple visits, specialists observed that the young people had no privacy when using the bathroom.
“Based upon observations, the provider’s bathroom facilities are not designed to allow youth to shower and/or perform bodily functions without others viewing them naked,” an OJJ specialist wrote in a February report. At the time, the jail held 20 young people. Their ages were not listed.
In another report, a specialist wrote that “a youth was observed on the toilet using the restroom in full view of other youth.”

Since 2022, civil rights attorneys have fought a protracted legal battle to ensure incarcerated kids receive the services they’re entitled to in a supportive environment. That year, the state announced it would send children to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, better known as Angola. A federal judge allowed the transfers to proceed, ruling that the unit is “therapeutic and rehabilitative while maintaining discipline, safety, and security,” in line with OJJ’s “rehabilitative, not punitive, mission.”
But after that judge visited the prison a year later, she ordered all children removed from Angola, finding that they ​​“are being victimized, traumatized, and seriously and irreparably harmed.” State officials moved the kids to the Jackson Parish Jail. Since then, children at the jail have said that they’ve been held in solitary confinement, sprayed with mace, shot with pepper balls, and denied educational and therapeutic services.
In November, OJJ terminated its contract with the Jackson Parish Sheriff’s Office, but the facility continues to hold kids. Invoices show that the agency paid the sheriff’s office more than $82,000 and over $86,000 for “juvenile housing” for December 2024 and January 2025, respectively. OJJ was billed more than $47,000 for March’s “juvenile housing.”
OJJ’s inspection reports echo many of the same issues documented by the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services, which visited the jail last April. As of July 1, 2024, OJJ became responsible for regulating and licensing juvenile detention facilities.
Although federal law requires that carceral facilities separate juveniles and adults by both sight and sound, an OJJ inspector reported in July that two adult detainees were housed in a room that was licensed to house children. The inspector did not specify if kids were also present. However, multiple young people have told the court that they frequently encounter adult detainees.
“The guards, who all wear sheriff deputy uniforms, did not keep me safe when I arrived here,” one child said in a January statement. “I was jumped by other kids thirteen (13) times, and once I was beaten up by guards.”
He says guards maced him seven or eight times.
“The mace really stings,” he said.

OJJ investigators found that the Jackson Parish Jail improperly handled suicide attempts that occurred in September and October.
According to a report on the September attempt, video shows a young person tying a ligature while an officer sat at a desk. About seven minutes later, the youth attempted to harm himself. The officer then radioed for assistance.
“[OJJ] [s]pecialists observed very little to no movement by staff during this time,” the investigator wrote. “Staff members must be moving around. The bunks are a critical issue and need to be addressed immediately to avoid any more attempts of suicide.”
The young person was placed on suicide watch. But, from Sept. 9 to Sept. 17, jail staff missed over 50 scheduled checks, which must occur every 15 minutes.
The OJJ specialist interviewed staff members who had spoken with the youth: three counselors, a nursing assistant, and several corrections officers. A counselor reported that the young person should speak with a psychiatrist, but documents do not indicate that he ever did.
One of the counselors told the OJJ specialist that only the nurse practitioner could take the young person off suicide watch.
In violation of state regulations, the jail also failed to report the suicide attempt to the “parent/legal guardian, defense counsel, and judge of record.”
Another report details an Oct. 30 suicide attempt, but it’s unclear if it involved the same person who attempted suicide in September.
In the October case, the report says jail staff failed to properly monitor the youth.
“Based upon record review, the level of mental health supervision provided to C-1 [the youth] was not determined by a qualified mental health professional,” the OJJ specialist wrote. “Provider failed to provide current policy for Suicide Management and Prevention.”
Instead of conducting in-person suicide watch checks, the report says jail staff monitored the young person using cameras—yet another violation of state regulations. On nine separate occasions, staff did not conduct the required 15-minute checks.

The reports also detail abuse by employees. During a five-week period from August to September, staff sprayed kids with a “chemical agent” at least 15 times, sometimes multiple times a day. After one incident, the staff failed to obtain immediate medical follow-ups for two young people. Specialists also found that the jail violated the required staff-to-youth ratio of 1 to 8. On one occasion, the specialist observed one staff member supervising 15 youth.
In a January inspection report, an OJJ specialist said he viewed footage of a jailer using a “chemical agent” against a youth. Although a “medical professional” told the specialist that he had “conducted an assessment” of the victim, there was no documentation that any examination had occurred.
The specialist viewed a video of another attack that occurred on the same day. In that case, two staffers used “a type of intervention on a youth that was not an approved physical escort technique, physical restraint, or mechanical restraint device.” The investigator said the detainee was removed “in a seated position,” and that the restraint techniques were “disproportionate to the actions and behavior” the youth exhibited. The specialist said the youth was not threatening themselves or others.
The two staff members “each had an arm extended above [the victim’s] head and behind his back,” and “were walking out of the room while dragging [the victim] out by the arms.”
After reviewing the inspection reports provided by The Appeal, David Utter, a member of the kids’ legal team, said that two state agencies have “found the jail to be severely lacking in the most basic treatment and rehabilitative and educational programs.”
Utter said that decades of research show that subjecting children to these types of conditions has catastrophic consequences.
“Kids do better when they’re home,” he told The Appeal. “Kids do better when we wrap services around them in their community. But Louisiana keeps on sending children to these punitive environments in the face of proven justice policy.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/jackson-parish-sheriffs-office-hq-png-1024x813.webp,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Coloradans’ trash negatively affects our health after going to landfills. How? Trash, especially food and yard waste, creates large amounts of invisible air pollution in the form of gases. This air pollution contains methane that negatively impacts our climate and toxic air pollutants like benzene and hydrogen sulfide that can make people sick. Coloradans living closest to landfills suffer the worst effects. All of us experience harm from landfill air pollution no matter where we live.
To help address this problem, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment recently proposed a Landfill Methane Rule to the Air Quality Control Commission. The rule’s purpose is to reduce the landfill gases that harm our bodies, our air, and our environment.
This rule would provide highly effective and economical ways to collect and reduce landfill air pollution. Biocovers and biofilters, which use bacteria to break down the gases, are one approach included in the proposed rule. Collecting the gases then burning them inside a closed structure (called enclosed flaring) is another. For either method to work well, highly accurate measurement of the amount of gases released from landfills is necessary to make sure landfill gases are being optimally reduced.
While biocovers and biofilters work well to reduce landfill gases, they are not enough to handle the overall amount of air pollution created by landfills. In order to meet our climate goals and protect public health, landfills will have to collect and burn landfill gases or put them to beneficial use (for instance, using landfill gases to generate energy).
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When I first learned the rule allows enclosed flaring as a method of pollution control, I was alarmed. I pictured oil and gas operations burning unwanted gases in highly polluting and inefficient open flames (called open flaring), a process that has serious impacts on our health. The proposed rule requires new landfill flares to be enclosed and existing open flares at landfills to be phased out by 2029. Enclosed flaring is a tightly controlled process that eliminates 98% to 99% of gases collected from a landfill.
Enclosed flaring is different from open flaring because an enclosed flare burns almost all of the gases collected and can be tested to make sure pollution reduction targets are being met. Unfortunately, some particulate air pollution is created during enclosed flaring (called combustion products), but enclosed flaring removes much more air pollution than it creates. As such, enclosed flaring is a needed tool to decrease the harm landfill gases cause to our health and environment.
While enclosed flaring is necessary, the public must be protected from combustion products created by the process. The combustion products released by enclosed flaring can be closely monitored and accurately measured. The proposed Landfill Methane Rule requires such monitoring and also requires that any pollution created by enclosed flaring meet air quality standards. In order to minimize the potential harms of enclosed flaring, air quality standards and the proposed monitoring processes must be rigorously enforced.
As a physician, I care a lot about the negative impacts of air pollution on our well-being. The best way to prevent landfill air pollution is to reduce the amount of food and yard waste going into landfills. We also must address the ongoing current air pollution from landfills. CDPHE’s proposed Landfill Methane Rule creates some of the strongest requirements in the country for reducing landfill air pollution.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states, including South Dakota, have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
Education board votes to finalize embrace of phonics-based reading instruction for South Dakota

In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
‘It’s the system that needs fixing’
Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law Monday.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Federal education cuts and Trump DEI demands leave states, teachers in limbo

The new law requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
Opposition to ‘science of reading’
Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.










A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.

In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

Shelley Moore Capito. (Getty Images)
At least some workers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health are getting back to work this week after federal cuts in early April took them off the job, according to a statement released Tuesday by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.
Those returning to work include some employees from the Coal Worker Health Surveillance Program and the Fire Fighters’ Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program. The total number of individuals who were granted reemployment has not been released.
And those who are returning to work will, at this time, only be doing so temporarily.
A Reduction In Force for the “vital” federal agency is still slated to go into effect in June and will impact these workers, according to a statement from the local chapter of the American Federation of Governmental Employees, a labor union representing the employees.
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of AFGE Local 3430 in Morgantown, said in a news release that the union is “encouraged” by the decision to call crucial workers back to work.
“This action, though temporary, allows these dedicated professionals to return to their critical roles in advancing worker safety and health across the country,” Tinney-Zara said. “Their return means renewed momentum for life-saving research, outreach and interventions that protect workers in high-risk industries and help prevent illness, injury, and death on the job.”
Notably, Tinney-Zara continued, it seems only workers in the CWHSP and the FFFIPP — programs that are “currently in the media spotlight” — were included in the calls to return to work. That leaves numerous other programs and initiatives undertaken by NIOSH still inoperable after cuts from the new federal Department of Government Efficiency hit the agency in early April.
“These are undoubtedly vital initiatives, but they are only a portion of the comprehensive, nationwide worker protection mission NIOSH fulfills,” Tinney-Zara said. “From construction sites to health care facilities, from transportation hubs to agricultural fields, NIOSH’s work touches nearly every corner of the American labor force.”
The directive offering some people their jobs back came after Capito, earlier this month, wrote a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging him to reconsider the cuts that cost at least 200 people their jobs — and, in turn, ended the programs they worked for — in the Morgantown NIOSH facility.
On Tuesday, Capito said in a statement that she was “encouraged that some NIOSH functions for coal miner and firefighter safety are slated to resume with some select staff returning to work this week.”
“But my understanding is that this is temporary so my focus will continue to be on working with [the federal Department of Health and Human Services] on permanently restoring these functions and personnel in the most efficient and effective manner,” Capito continued.
In her letter to Kennedy on April 21, Capito emphasized how critical Morgantown’s NIOSH facility and the workers within it were to combatting deadly black lung disease and protecting miners who are now being pushed, through initiatives by the Trump Administration, to mine more coal than any time in recent memory.
“The NIOSH Mining Program works to eliminate mining fatalities and injuries. Research in rock dust has resulted in safety changes to prevent explosions in underground mines …” Capito wrote. “NIOSH’s [CWHSP] studies respiratory disease and provides black lung screenings to coal miners. It is my understanding that the RIF impacted every employee in these important programs.”
With work by the CWHSP halted since April 1, coal miners in central Appalachia have been without access to critical health services and surveillance, including free screeningsfor black lung and a program that allows them, once diagnosed with black lung, to request relocating to a different, less dusty portion of a mine in order to mitigate the worst developments of the deadly disease.
Anyone requesting to relocate in a mine — a labor right afforded to miners through the Part 90 program — must have their black lung testing results evaluated and marked eligible by a NIOSH worker in order to be approved.
But with DOGE’s cuts, those workers didn’t exist anymore.
The reduction in services for coal miners comes as a surge of black lung disease is hitting the workforce. It also hits as implementation of a federal rule that would limit miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust for the first time ever has been delayed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
When the silica dust rule was slated to go into effect this month, the former secretary for the federal Department of Labor estimated that it could potentially save thousands of lives.
Now, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration — the agency that would be in charge of enacting and enforcing the silica rule — is being temporarily headed by an attorney who worked with industry groups that lobbied against implementation of exposure limits for silica, which advocates and coal mining veterans have colored as being life saving if ever implemented.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NIOSH-GettyImages-1439782819-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

President Donald Trump marked the 100th day of his second term on Tuesday as Gov. JB Pritzker has spent the week calling on Americans to pressure congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s agenda and highlighting how Trump’s policies affect Illinois.

“I'm deeply concerned about what the next 100 days, and frankly, the next 1,000 days will be like,” Pritzker said Tuesday night during a virtual town hall.

Pritzker appeared on the progressive MeidasTouch podcast’s live town hall alongside three other Democratic governors: Kathy Hochul, of New York, Maura Healey, of Massachusetts, and Tim Walz, of Minnesota — the unsuccessful 2024 vice presidential nominee.

Throughout the town hall, the second-term Illinois governor continued calling for Americans to make their voices heard against what he perceives as a destructive Trump administration.

“I believe that we all ought to be mobilizing,” Pritzker told a Florida resident. “It's the best way for us to get across what we really believe is that, you know, show up at your Republican congressman's office and let them know: Quit shutting down veteran services, quit taking away Social Security and Medicaid.”

But for Democrats to be successful in future election cycles, the party must deliver results on voters’ priorities, Pritzker said. In addition to explaining a “simple message” about the party’s values to voters, Democrats should also embrace alternative media interviews to reach new voters, he said, pointing to a string of podcasts Walz appeared on during last year’s vice-presidential campaign.

“He was everywhere,” Pritzker said. “We've got to do that, all of us, and make sure that the Democratic message of standing up for working families is heard everywhere and directly to people who are online.”

Pritzker’s live podcast appearance Tuesday came two days after he delivered blistering criticism of unnamed people in his party for using podcasts and media interviews to chastise other Democrats.

“What I find ironic about the current conversation surrounding our party is that the voices flocking to podcasts and cable news shows to admonish fellow Democrats for not caring enough about the struggles of working families are the same ones who, when it comes to relieving the struggles of real people, have been timid, not bold,” Pritzker told a fundraiser for the New Hampshire Democratic Party on Sunday.

New Hampshire has typically held the first presidential primary election, usually following the Iowa caucus.

Pritzker, who also appeared Monday on MSNBC, has been working himself into the national spotlight for months since Trump took over the White House in January. Appearances on trendy podcasts and prime time cable TV shows have become a regular part of the governor’s schedule.

Pritzker received national attention after he warned of similarities between Nazi Germany and the Trump administration in his February State of the State address. His remarks in New Hampshire on Sunday drew more attention as headlines in publications including The New York Times declared the speech “stokes 2028 talks.”

Pritzker downplayed any links between the speech and his personal ambitions, saying he’s only trying to send a message to the party about what the platform for 2026 should be while defending Illinois against the Trump administration’s policies.

“I was surprised that so many people covered that,” Pritzker told reporters in Chicago on Monday.

The speech also struck a nerve with Republicans as Pritzker suggested Democrats “will never join so many Republicans in the special place in hell reserved for quislings and cowards.”

“Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption,” Pritzker said Sunday. “But I am now. These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. They must understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have. We must castigate them on the soap box and then punish them at the ballot box.”

Pritzker first called on Democrats to become “street fighters” and engage in mass protest at a Human Rights Campaign dinner in March in Los Angelas.

The Illinois Republican Party cried foul in a news release titled “Pritzker calls for violence against Republicans.”

“His comments if nothing else could be construed as inciting violence,” Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said.

Pritzker scoffed at Miller’s criticism, saying he didn’t listen to the speech.

“Peaceful protest is what I’m talking about. It’s about standing up, speaking out,” Pritzker told reporters. “Again, using your megaphone, your microphone, whatever you’ve got. And the peace that I’m talking about is making sure that they know at all times that the American public opposes the policies of Congressional Republicans and of the White House.”

Outside public appearances this week, Pritzker’s political organization also announced it was beginning a new video series highlighting Illinoisians who have been hurt by cuts to the federal government under Trump. And to mark Trump’s 100th day in office, the governor’s office released a list of 100 ways “Trump and Republicans are hurting Illinois.”

Responding to a Chicago voter’s concerns about affordable housing during Tuesday night’s town hall, Pritzker rattled off legislation and state spending increases approved under his administration as a way he’s trying to help. But he also argued it’s ultimately going to be challenging to address such concerns with Trump as president.

“Donald Trump is making everything harder,” Pritzker said. “Housing, rent, being able to borrow money to buy your first home, or any home, and that's something that we're all going to have to live with until we're able to overturn the Congress.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/ct-budget-republicans/,"With pressure on the spending cap and the threat of federal cuts, CT legislators are facing a tricky political mix as they craft a budget.","Drafting a state budget that spends tens of billions of dollars annually, often increases taxes or fees at least modestly — and always leaves some groups dissatisfied — is never an easy process.
Add to the mix the potential loss of billions in federal aid later this year, and the politics goes beyond tricky as legislators begin the final push to craft a new spending plan before they adjourn five weeks from now.
Majority Democratic legislators recently reminded Republicans to be careful with their budget rhetoric — because they may have to put their votes where their mouths are.
Meanwhile, House Republicans will remind Democrats on Thursday to be careful what they wish for when the GOP caucus unveils its own plan to solve Connecticut’s latest budget dilemma. And if Democrats are serious about good government, GOP leaders say, they can’t ignore ideas from the other side of the aisle.
Republicans criticize the budget but don’t always draft one
“This is a game they have played for years,” Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said of Republicans’ off-again, on-again approach to state finances.
With a couple of exceptions, Republicans have been in the minority at the state Capitol since 1985. The GOP held a slim 19-17 edge in the Senate in 1995 and 1996, and that chamber was tied 18-18 in the 2017 and 2018 sessions.
That means Democrats hold majorities on all committees, including the two budget-writing panels. It also means Republicans can propose a minority budget if they want — or simply criticize select elements of the Democrats’ plan without offering a holistic alternative.
Neither House nor Senate Republicans offered budgets in 2019 or 2021. Neither party did so in 2020, when COVID’s arrival forced the Capitol’s closure in early March. The Senate GOP also didn’t show its cards last year, and Sen. Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, the minority leader, said the caucus still hasn’t decided whether it will this year.
The GOP plans that are submitted often contain gimmicks and other questionable maneuvers, just as do the Democratic proposals they criticize. Democrats say Republican budgets routinely promise tax relief and easy fixes to deficits by exaggerating savings from hiring freezes, employing across-the-board cuts in miscellaneous accounts that don’t assess the actual impacts, and sometimes by thinking wishfully.
A 2010 GOP plan still recalled at the Capitol would have plugged a huge $800 million hole in the General Fund not by cutting programs or raising taxes — but by selling Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks and Hartford-Brainard Airport. About 5% of ongoing programs in the General Fund would have been covered, for one year, by one-time sales proceeds. Republicans decided Connecticut could get $800 million for the two airports based on the proposed 2009 sale of Chicago Midway International Airport for $2.5 billion, which ultimately fell through.
Democrats: GOP has voted to exceed the spending cap twice this year
Sen. Cathy Osten, a Democrat from Sprague who co-chairs the Appropriations Committee, was disappointed that her Senate GOP colleagues aren’t ready to write a budget detail, given their frequent calls for adherence to sound fiscal principles. 
“I think the [Republican] rhetoric is pretty strong this year,” she added.
Republicans chastised Osten’s panel last week when Democrats unveiled a $55.7 billion, biennial plan that would exceed Connecticut’s spending cap by $215 million next fiscal year.
Legislatures legally can exceed the cap, which ties most budget growth to household income and inflation, with a 60% vote of approval and the governor’s endorsement but haven’t done so since 2007. Exceeding the cap became politically taboo shortly after that as big spending growth, massive pension debt and a severe recession triggered major state tax hikes in 2009, 2011 and 2015.
Pressures on the spending cap
Democrats and Republicans voted overwhelmingly in late February to send an extra $40 million to local schools to mitigate a special education funding crisis. That happened despite warnings from Gov. Ned Lamont that the current state budget already was on pace to exceed the cap by $61 million.
And while the Appropriations Committee’s plan originally continued those extra $40 million special education payments for each of the next two fiscal years, members from both parties insisted they wanted more.
Republicans would support $124 million per year in extra payments, but only if funding for public colleges and universities were reduced by $84 million annually to offset the special ed increase. Higher education institutions entered this fiscal year with close to $1.1 billion in reserves and could absorb the cut, the GOP argued.
Democrats rejected that, noting that college students have faced significant tuition hikes in recent years. And hundreds of millions of dollars in temporary federal pandemic grants, which have propped up college and university programs, will vanish after this year.
Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, then proposed adding another $84 million for special education in each of the next two years without offsetting cuts  to higher education, which pushed the committee budget from $131 million over the spending cap in 2025-26 to $215 million.
Despite their statements in support of the cap, about half of the committee’s 13 Republicans voted for Nolan’s amendment.
“If we agreed our children deserve that quality education,” Nolan said, “it shouldn’t be up for a debate.”
It’s easy to pledge allegiance to the spending cap, but harder to remain loyal when a priority like local school aid is on the chopping block, said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who added there are consequences to heated political attacks.
“If your rhetoric gets too strong, you may lose things you had in the budget,” he said.
GOP: Democrats don’t listen, don’t save
But Republican leaders counter that Democrats have short memories.
The GOP always has been willing to come to the table, provided they are partners and their ideas are given due consideration. Too often, they added, Democrats simply want Republicans to vote for bloated spending and unnecessary tax hikes so both parties share the blame.
When Democrats couldn’t pass a budget in 2017 despite a House majority and control of the governor’s office, Republicans joined a bipartisan effort. That yielded new budget caps that built a paltry $212 million rainy day fund, equal to about 1% of the General Fund, into a record-setting $4.1 billion bulwark against the next recession.
Those same caps, or “fiscal guardrails,” also produced more than $8.5 billion in supplemental payments against Connecticut’s massive pension debt (the state entered this fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded liabilities in this area). 
Republicans note that the last time Connecticut enjoyed big surpluses, before the “guardrails” era, Democratic-controlled legislatures spent far more than they socked away, even though those legislatures were working with Republican governors.
Between the 2003-04 and 2007-08 fiscal years, Connecticut ran up $3.6 billion in potential surpluses, according to records from the comptroller’s office and the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis.
But state officials would deposit just 38% of that windfall, about $1.38 billion, in the rainy day fund during this five-year period. The remaining $2.25 billion, or nearly two-thirds of the rest, would be spent.
While acknowledging that Republicans voted this year for special education funding that threatens to break the spending cap, Harding says his caucus still believes legislators must adhere to the “fiscal guardrails” while not boosting taxes.
“And it seems there’s an unwillingness to do that on their [Democrats’] end,” Harding said. 
The Democratic-controlled Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee proposed an income tax surcharge on the capital gains earnings of wealthy households and an array of business tax increases that collectively would generate more than $460 million per year. 
But while Democrats say some of that revenue would be needed to maintain state programs in the face of likely cuts in federal funding, about $175 million of that new revenue would be returned to poor and middle-class families in the form of a new $150-per-child income tax credit.
House Republicans also are expected to offer tax relief Thursday when they provide their own budget proposal for the next two fiscal years.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House GOP member on the Appropriations Committee, said her caucus always intended to offer its own solutions to the fiscal challenges facing Connecticut, adding it will be cost-efficient and respectful of the heavy burdens state taxpayers already face.
The real question, Nuccio added, is whether majority Democrats will include House Republicans in budget negotiations with the Lamont administration and incorporate GOP proposals into the final plan. 
“We are not the party of ‘No,’” Nuccio said. “We’re the party of options. We’re just being ignored.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0220_SR_PuraHearing_219-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 11:08:58.447310

Utah state leaders are taking the next steps in their efforts to make Utah a major nuclear energy development hub and a “national leader” in developing next-generation energy technology, reaching beyond state lines to do it.
It starts with Utah signing two memorandums of understanding with Idaho and Wyoming as part of a strategy to fire up innovation and collaboration in the region.
As part of Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit,” which his office said brought together leaders from across the nuclear energy industry on Tuesday, Cox joined Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, both Republicans, in signing an MOU that calls for the three states to work together coordinating nuclear infrastructure, accelerating nuclear development, and advocating for “commonsense federal policies.”
“The West will lead the next chapter of energy abundance and American prosperity,” Cox said in a statement announcing the alliance. “Today, we brought together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to chart the course for nuclear energy. Our new compact strengthens our shared commitment to aggressively pursue more affordable, reliable energy across state lines.”
According to Cox’s office, the states agreed in the MOU to collaborate on:

Aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment.
Coordinating the development of critical energy infrastructure.
Jointly navigating regulatory and environmental challenges.
Advocating for federal support of regional energy priorities.
Enhancing energy resilience and grid reliability.
Expanding workforce development efforts to support the growing energy sector.
Ensuring continued delivery of affordable energy to residents.

The tri-state agreement comes the day after Utah officials and the Idaho National Laboratory — one of 17 national labs in the U.S. Department of Energy complex that’s focused on nuclear research — signed a memorandum of understanding Monday evening after ceremoniously signing a slate of energy bills Utah lawmakers passed earlier this year.
With more local input, Legislature signs on to the beginning of Utah’s nuclear future

The MOU between Utah leaders and the Idaho National Laboratory establishes a “formal, long-term collaboration on advanced energy research, workforce development and technology deployment — particularly on nuclear innovation,” according to the governor’s office.
“This partnership will accelerate Utah’s efforts to become the nation’s nuclear hub,” Cox said in a prepared statement issued Monday evening. “By linking our universities, labs, and industry partners with the expertise of Idaho National Laboratory, we are strengthening our ability to serve Utahns with reliable and affordable energy.”
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner, who signed the MOU, said he and other lab officials are “excited to partner with Utah to address urgent energy needs by focusing on advanced nuclear and energy innovation.”
“This partnership establishes a cooperative framework for scientific, technological and workforce development to help Utah realize an abundant, secure, resilient and competitive energy future,” he said.
The MOU, according to the governor’s office, creates a “structural, interdisciplinary alliance” between Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory. It envisions Utah as establishing a new institute called the Advanced Nuclear Energy Institute as a “key coordinating hub” between the Idaho National Laboratory, Utah’s system of higher education, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab.
“By linking the capabilities of INL with the talent and resources of Utah’s higher education institutions, this partnership positions Utah as a national leader in developing the next generation of clean, secure and resilient energy technologies,” the governor’s office said in Monday’s news release.
This new institute, state officials say, will enable Utah’s universities to collaborate with other organizations to pursue federal research grants.
“Beyond academic research, the focus is on applied innovation — ensuring resources are used effectively to develop commercially viable, scalable technologies,” the governor’s office said. “This approach will accelerate the deployment of real-world energy solutions and help build a broader, more robust nuclear energy ecosystem in Utah and the surrounding region.”
Through the MOU, state leaders say Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory will work together to:

Accelerate development of “next-generation” nuclear technologies.
Enhance scientific research in energy sectors.
Strengthen cybersecurity and physical security for energy infrastructure.
Build up the workforce needed to meet demands of a future energy economy.

The Utah legislature’s top Republican leaders both applauded the move as crucial for Utah’s future.
“Affordable, reliable energy is the driving force behind Utah’s prosperity — powering everything from the lights in Utahns homes to the unstoppable growth of the state’s vibrant economy,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a prepared statement. “As energy demands increase and technologies rapidly evolve, we as a state are committed to staying ahead of the curve through strategic partnership that ensures both innovation and stability.”
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Utah “is leading the way with smart, strategic investments in our energy future.”
“This partnership drives innovation and keeps energy reliable and affordable for Utah families and businesses,” Schultz said. “It’s about long-term solutions that protect our economy and strengthen our position as a national energy leader.”

NEWARK — A high-speed crash involving a stolen U-Haul truck left one person dead and several others injured Monday evening in downtown Newark.
The incident began around 4:30 p.m. when Newark Police located a U-Haul vehicle reported as unauthorized after it was not returned on its scheduled due date of March 18.
The truck, occupied by two individuals, was found in a parking lot in the 200 block of East Main Street.
As officers moved in to arrest the suspects, the vehicle sped off, striking a marked police car in the process.
Police say they did not pursue the vehicle, which exited the lot at a high speed.
Just minutes later, around 4:35 p.m., the truck was traveling westbound on East Main Street when it struck two pedestrians standing beside a parked car.
The vehicle continued on, hitting multiple parked cars before becoming disabled farther down the road.
First responders arrived quickly to render aid. One pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene despite life-saving efforts.

A second victim sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital.
Their identities have not yet been released, pending notification of next of kin.
The driver of the U-Haul also sustained serious injuries and was taken to the hospital. Both the driver and passenger were detained by police at the scene.
According to Aetna Hose, Hook & Ladder Company, three additional people were transported to a nearby emergency room with non-life-threatening injuries, while three others were treated on site and declined further medical care.

The week-long firefight began near Johnstown in Brown County after a prescribed burn escaped containment on April 21, which a private landowner had led in coordination with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, local fire departments and other partners.. 
Last week, Gov. Jim Pillen initiated a statewide burn ban through the end of April. On Tuesday, he narrowed the ban to and extended it for central and western Nebraska through midnight on May 10. He also prohibited permitted burns in eastern Nebraska if there is an active red flag warning from the National Weather Service.

More than 7,000 acres were burned in the Plum Creek area that includes canyons, hills and water on the northern edge, which state officials said had complicated the disaster response.
Over 50 different local fire departments, many volunteer-based, responded to the fire, as did the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, NEMA, State Fire Marshal’s Office, Nebraska National Guard, Nebraska State Patrol, Game and Parks and Nebraska Forest Service.
More than 45 cattle were killed, and the fire destroyed one cabin (a secondary residence) and at least eight utility poles.
The fire and continued burn ban came amid severe drought conditions for much of the state.
“It’s way too dry, and it doesn’t make any sense,” Pillen told reporters last Wednesday. “It only takes one burn, one mistake, and the one that took place … really, really made no sense.”
He continued: “We need Mother Nature to get on our side, and we need to get drenched. We need a tsunami. So if Nebraskans want to pray for a tsunami, I think we’d take that, right, or a drenching rain.”

(File photo by Getty Images)A 179-year-old, private college in South Carolina’s Upstate will officially close and sell its campus.
Limestone University’s governing board made the final decision after several hours of deliberations late Tuesday, the last day of classes for the spring semester. The vote for closure followed a series of hopes and disappointments for students unsure about the fate of their school and their academic and athletic future.
The college first made its financial straits known two weeks ago, when President Nathan Copeland announced to students and staff that Limestone faced a $6 million budget shortfall, which could lead to its closure.
Limestone had been holding out for an eleventh hour donation in hopes of keeping its doors open. It managed to raise $2.1 million but still fell short of what school officials said it needed to stay afloat in the short term.
Even if it had succeeded, the college still would have needed a long-term solution to its growing financial woes.
“Words cannot fully express the sorrow we feel in having to share this news,” Copeland said in a statement. “Our students, alumni, faculty, staff, and supporters fought tirelessly to save this historic institution. While the outcome is not what we hoped for, we are forever grateful for the passion, loyalty, and prayers of our Saints family.”
The school has cited enrollment declines impacting colleges nationwide and rising costs for its demise.
Limestone’s enrollment fell by half over the past decade, from 3,214 students in fall 2014, according to state higher education data, to 1,600 now, both online and in person according to the university’s announcement.
At first, the board said it would continue with its online classes, which would have allowed the college to continue with its associated charter school management operations — Limestone Charter Association — which sponors 13 K-12 public charter schools.
But online operations are also ending and at least 478 people employed by the college are losing their jobs.










Limestone has been a point of pride, tradition, and inspiration for our residents. It has opened doors for countless local students and families. Many of them were first-generation college students and helped shape dreams into realitie


– Lyman Dawkins III, mayor of Gaffney


Limestone was founded in 1845 by Thomas Curtis, a Baptist minister from England. It began as the Limestone Springs Female High School and held classes in the town’s former hotel, built by the founder of a limestone quarry that supported the area economy for nearly a century.
At the time of its opening, Limestone was the first women’s college in South Carolina, and among the first in the country. The college began admitting men in the early 1900s, but did not initially allow them to live on campus.
While not the largest employer in Cherokee County, it is the county’s only four-year institution of higher education.
Gaffney’s mayor and Limestone alumnus Lyman Dawkins III, called the college “a cornerstone of our city educationally, economically and culturally.”
“Limestone has provided countless jobs, brought in students and families who supported local businesses and served as a catalyst for growth,” Dawkins wrote in an online statement after closure was first announced two weeks ago.
He cited Gaffney’s efforts to revitalize its downtown and said students have played a vital role.
“Their energy, involvement, and contributions have breathed life into our city and helped us build momentum for the future,” Dawkins said.
“Limestone has been a point of pride, tradition, and inspiration for our residents. It has opened doors for countless local students and families. Many of them were first-generation college students and helped shape dreams into realities,” Dawkins added.
Auditors reported the school had a $7.6 million operating loss as of June 2024. Its shortfalls were caused by a decline in enrollment and uncontrolled spending in previous years.
Since 2020, the school has borrowed some $22 million from its small endowment, which had a balance of just $9.2 million last June the audit showed.
“These factors create uncertainty regarding the University’s ability to continue,” the auditors wrote.
The school also faced an additional $30 million in debt, according to Copeland, who took over as university president last year and laid plans he hoped could have sustained the school. The debt comes from a 40-year U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development loan, which Limestone took out in 2018 to construct a new library and student center, purchase a residence hall and refinance previous debt.
Limestone is not alone. Small, private colleges with meager endowments have been closing across the country. According to Inside Higher Ed, 2023 saw 15 colleges announce closures. That was followed by another 16 in 2024.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA— Strangulation is among the most common types of abuse in domestic violence situations. Yet, South Carolina is the only state without specific penalties for the crime.
A Senate proposal seeks to change that.
Restricting someone’s ability to breathe with the intent to hurt them would be punishable by between three and 10 years in prison under the proposal which passed unanimously out of committee Tuesday to be taken up on the Senate floor. Penalties climb as high as 20 years in prison when someone uses a weapon, violates a restraining order or has a prior strangulation convection.
If passed in the Senate, the bill will still have to go through the legislative process in the House. Meanwhile only five legislative days remain in the first year of the two-year session.
When it was her turn to speak in favor of the bill, Lauren Moose, a forensic nurse examiner at McLeod Health in Florence, asked a Senate panel to set a timer for 2 ½ minutes and stay silent. That’s the amount of time it takes to kill someone by strangling them, she explained.
“Think about somebody sitting there, literally watching somebody’s life exit their hands,” she said.
Domestic violence victims in SC can wait weeks for legal protections

The Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention says between 68% and 80% of abused women will experience “near-fatal strangulation.”
And the likelihood of being killed by your partner is 10 times higher if they’ve strangled you, the National Domestic Violence Hotline says on its website.
South Carolina has a long history of domestic violence, particularly against women. For a quarter century, the state was consistently in the top 10 nationally in the murder rate for women killed by men, according to the Violence Policy Center. While the center no longer rates states, South Carolina still outpaced the national rate. In 2022, the most recent year of data available, 56 female victims were killed by men in the state.
The state still has the sixth-highest rate of domestic violence in the country, according to Break the Cycle, a nonprofit dedicated to helping survivors of domestic violence.
A Senator on the committee said he’s seen what strangulation can do firsthand.
Sen. Ed Sutton, D-Charleston, said his cousin was the victim of domestic violence in which her abuser strangled her. After the attack, she continued to have long-term breathing issues. Tori Burke died in 2021, a year later, after contracting COVID-19, leaving behind two daughters.
“This is a pretty awful crime and a pretty awful thing for a family to go through,” he said.
Still, others questioned whether the law was necessary, arguing these crimes already fall under assault.
Freshman Sen. J.D. Chaplin said he worries the bill is excessive.
“Why do we need something for strangulation?” the Hartsville Republican asked.
Hundreds of girls in SC are trafficking victims. A Columbia nonprofit offers help for survivors.

Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said he supported “the overall context of protecting domestic violence victims and anyone else from strangulation” but wanted to know whether it would affect police trying to restrain a suspect.
The bill’s lead sponsor, Sen. Brian Adams, responded to questions saying strangulation tends to be more violent than a typical assault.
Plus, the state Legislature already passed a law in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death at the hands of police officers in Minnesota, the Goose Creek Republican reminded his fellow senators. That law banning the use of chokeholds except in a situation where deadly force would be reasonable went into effect on New Years Day 2023.
The proposed strangulation charge would actually help law enforcement, according to Adams, who is a retired police officer.
Cases involving strangulation tend to result in either low or medium-level assault charges, Brian Bennett, a retired officer of the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy, told the SC Daily Gazette.
“No law for strangulation means it can be minimized,” said Bennett, who has been advocating for strangulation laws for a decade.
The bill would make strangulation a felony with significant prison time, which Bennett said better fits a crime where the effects tend to be long-lasting. It also would make it easier to track how prevalent the crime is in the state.
There have been multiple bills filed in recent years to create strangulation charges, including a House proposal filed back in December before this year’s session. None have gotten significant traction. Bennett has begged legislators to consider each one, with no success. Yet, he’s felt the pleas slowly create awareness within the Statehouse, he said.
“I think they are more receptive than they were in the past,” he said. “It’s like every session we gain ground.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-76-1-1024x576.png,,,2025-04-30 10:08:23.621695

Joe Nicola, shown on the opening day of the 2025 legislative session, complained Tuesday night that the state budget process “is a dog and pony show” (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The only member of the Missouri Senate who was never a public official before winning election had a scathing verdict on the budget debate he witnessed Tuesday night.
“I think this is one of the worst processes I’ve ever seen and been a part of,” said state Sen. Joe Nicola, a Republican from Independence. “I think it’s broken.”
Nicola spoke after watching the bitterest 20 minutes of the five-hour budget debate. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough had just finished telling state Sen. Rick Brattin of Harrisonville that he would not support an amendment restoring 25 employees and $684,000 cut from Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ budget during committee work.
One of the reasons Hough gave for opposing any amendments to the bills was that many budget lines include both state and federal money, where Missouri taxpayers supply matching funds at varying rates.
Increasing the state money spent on one, Hough said, triggers changes in how much federal funding should be listed. It was all too complicated to change anything on the floor, he added.
“There is so much work that goes in behind the scenes and in the committee that when you come out here and you start — and you can laugh, if you would like — but if you come out here and you start changing, and you start amending the budget bills, you don’t understand the actual implications,” Hough said.
But Nicola’s complaint wasn’t completely about the scene he had witnessed. It was that he was lost trying to read the 13 bills appropriating $49.5 billion in large amounts for education, public safety, health and welfare programs alongside small sums for things described in often obscure language.
“Just pass it. We can’t put an amendment, very little debate, like we’re wasting our time,” Nicola said. “This whole thing is a dog and pony show. Absolutely ridiculous.”
With Senate passage of the 13 bills, they return to the House and the process to set up a conference committee to negotiate a final proposal will begin. The Senate Appropriations Committee must now turn to capital appropriations bills spending an additional $3.7 billion and get them ready for Senate votes.
 Gov. Mike Kehoe reiterates his focus on public safety during his State of the State speech Jan. 28 in the Missouri House chamber (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The conference committee will have to reconcile differences over education funding that will test new Gov. Mike Kehoe’s ability and willingness to influence the outcome.
The Senate-passed budget allocates almost $300 million more than Kehoe requested for the public school foundation formula and omits $50 million the governor wanted to enlarge a scholarship program for private school tuition.
Overall, the Senate budget would spend $1.6 billion more than the House version and $575 million less that Kehoe requested. In general revenue — money mainly from income and sales taxes — the Senate plan would spend $15.7 billion, $491 million more than Kehoe proposed and $1.3 billion more than the House version.
Other significant differences between the House and Senate include:

The state employee pay plan. The Senate and Kehoe propose a raise of 1% for every two years worked, capped at 10%. The House version is capped at a 5% raise.
New child care funding. The Senate approved Kehoe’s request for $107 million to shift the child care subsidy program to prospective payments based on enrollment instead of after-the-fact payments based on attendance. The House did not approve the money.
Higher education funding. Kehoe proposed a 1.5% increase for colleges and universities, the House agreed and added $28 million for one-time maintenance and repair and the Senate proposed an ongoing 3% increase.
Earmarks for projects and programs. The House added 149 items to the budget with a total cost of $295 million. The Senate cut 57, totaling $126.3 million, and added 169 of its own to the operating budget at a cost of $441 million. There are 44 earmarks in the capital appropriations that have not had a Senate committee hearing yet.

The school funding differences in the budget will be the biggest item of contention in the conference committee.
When Kehoe, who is in his first year as governor, refused to fund an increase to public schools based on the statutory calculation of the foundation formula, he said the extra money was the result of bureaucratic processes that he distrusted.
The House, in the budget it approved at the beginning of April, went along with Kehoe, funding the public school formula at the $3.7 billion being spent this year.
As he presented the budget, Hough said the extra money represents a promise from the past that must be fulfilled.
“I see this as making good on the commitment that was passed by the legislature last year,” Hough said.
The element that will decide how much is eventually spent on the foundation formula is the state adequacy target, the calculation of the per-pupil amount spent in districts that are high-performing on state accountability measures. For the current year, the amount is $6,760 per student and the statutory calculation in the formula would make it $7,145 for the coming fiscal year.
The legislature can set the number in the appropriation bill and that is what will test Kehoe’s ability and willingness to influence the upcoming conference committee. 
 State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern is introduced to the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
During debate, Democrats said even the increased funding was inadequate. State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from Kansas City and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Missouri needs to do more for schools.
“People ask me, ‘oh do you love the Senate version of the budget?’’’ Nurrenbern said. “No, I don’t love the Senate version of the budget, because we are putting less money into public education than nearly every other state in the nation.”
The discussion of the increase to the foundation formula was one of the longest of the budget debate. There was no discussion at all, however, of the cut to the private-school scholarship program.
And while most of the focus during debate on the bill funding education programs was on the increased foundation formula, discussion veered into culture wars when Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman offered an amendment to bar all funding for the YMCA.
Kansas City police are investigating reports of an incident at the North Kansas City YMCA where a child reported an adult with male genitalia exposed was in a women’s locker room. WDAF Fox4 reported that the mother of the child said the person claimed to be a woman.
Coleman said she was upset by statements from the YMCA that “individuals are allowed to use the locker room or restroom that they identify with.” She also said she was offended when representatives of the YMCA, visiting her office, did not respect her concerns that state law was not being followed.
“The frustration that I have of a lack of taking seriously the state laws from a provider that is being paid from the state I thought warranted a vote on this defunding,” Coleman said.
Other lawmakers defended YMCA as a provider of important programs for children. Hough said the organization receives about $12- to $13 million a year in state funding, mostly for after school and summer camp programs through child care programs.
“Imagine if we came in and, for one weird incident, started penalizing across the board, removing all funding” from private organizations, Nurrenbern said.
Coleman eventually withdrew the amendment, but she forced a vote later in the Department of Corrections budget when she tried to cut $21,900 in funding to purchase drugs used for executions.
“These are Chinese made pharmaceuticals that are used to kill by the state those who’ve been convicted of the death penalty,” Coleman said. “And you know when I was first elected I think I would have said that I was in favor of the death penalty, and I have had a real evolution, as I have learned more about how inconsistently it has been applied, and I no longer support it.”
Brattin spoke against the amendment, arguing that he preferred public executions by firing squads.
“Mercy to those who carry out these sorts of acts is an injustice to the victims and their families,” Brattin said.
Coleman’s amendment was defeated 11-22.
The budget is balanced by tapping the state’s accumulated surplus. But with revenues declining more than 1% and uncertainty about future federal funding, the only member who was a lawmaker during the contraction following the 2008 financial crash warned his colleagues to be careful with the surplus.
State Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia, was a House member from 2009 to 20017. In his first years in office, lawmakers made budget cuts, not increases.
“I’m just telling everybody it’s a lot more enjoyable when you’re adding money for worthy projects in your district, rather than when you’re trying to explain to folks in your district that even though you support the program, it has to get cut because there’s just no other money,” Webber said.
Hough, during a discussion with Nurrenbern, said that while there are dozens of projects in the budget requested by lawmakers, he has to draw the line somewhere. He noted he had turned down her requests to help child care providers in her district.
“I’ve had other members that have come in and said, you know, we need to spend X number of dollars on this courthouse,” Hough said. “Well, that’s great, but do you know how many courthouses there are in the state? And if we open that box, how do we ever bring it back in?”
 Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, shown in 2024 while he was a member of the state Senate, lost 25 employees in a budget cut political friends said was revenge for his activities as a member of the Missouri Freedom Caucus (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The disagreement over the employees cut from Hoskins’ budget was a reminder of the factional fights that wracked the Senate over the last four years. Hoskins, a former state senator, was a member of the Freedom Caucus, and before it a group that called itself the conservative caucus.
During budget work, Hoskins would target employee slots that had been unfilled for lengthy periods. One of his factional foes, state Sen. Mike Cierpiot, a Republican from Lee’s Summit, used that logic to cut 25 of 63 open positions in Hoskins’ new office.
“I thought taking 25 of those 63 was a very reasonable, measured way to do things,” Cierpiot said while debating with state Sen. Ben Brown, a Republican from Washington 
“But only with the person that’s now running a state office, that that may have had disagreements with you in the past,” Brown replied.
“No, only with a person who has talked about doing this for years in the past,” Cierpiot said.
Every statewide elected official’s office used less than its allotment of employee hours in the most recent complete fiscal year. The vacancy rate for the secretary of state’s office was 23.3%, lower than any other office except state treasurer.
Brattin complained that offices with higher vacancy rates remained untouched while Hoskins lost 25 slots and Lt. Gov. David Wasinger, who defeated Hough in the 2024 Republican primary, lost one of eight assigned to his office.
“It is below what I thought we had kind of gotten to, the place of the Senate this session, trying to let bygones be bygones,” Brattin said. “But it’s quite clear that that’s not what we’re willing to do here, and utilize their position and act as though we’re a bunch of imbeciles.”

Photo courtesy of the Minnesota Historical Society.The Minnesota House passed a housing budget bill Tuesday, featuring funding boosts for homelessness prevention and affordable housing development, plus $100 million in bonds for financing housing developments statewide. 
But the Senate’s housing budget, which passed the chamber last week, is about $62 million smaller than the House version and it doesn’t include bonds. 
The details must be hashed out in conference committee and re-approved by both chambers before the legislative session adjourns on May 19. 
Neither the budget bill nor a housing policy bill that passed Thursday includes the sweeping zoning reforms proposed by a bipartisan coalition of advocacy groups and lawmakers, including all housing committee leaders. Those bills would have allowed apartments in areas currently zoned for commercial use; legalized duplexes on every residential lot in the state; required municipalities to allow higher-density development along transit corridors; and barred city governments from requiring builders to use certain materials, colors or designs.
Supporters of those bills argue that they would encourage the construction of more housing, alleviating Minnesota’s housing shortage and lowering prices.
The outlook is bleak for those bills, as city governments and their lobbyists oppose any legislation that rolls back local control over zoning.
In floor discussion of the budget bill, housing leaders said the budget doesn’t go far enough in addressing the shortage. 
“I’m a little disappointed,” said Rep. Jim Nash, R-Waconia, a member of the housing committee and the coalition pushing for zoning reforms. Regulatory reform is needed to make a major dent in the housing crisis, he said. 
The “Yes to Homes” coalition got one minor win: the House budget bill instructs the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency to prioritize developments in communities that have zoning rules that make it easier to build multifamily homes, allow smaller homes and don’t require certain materials or designs.  
Funding for homelessness prevention 
The House housing budget contains significantly more funding than the Senate version for a homelessness prevention program. 
The Family Homelessness Prevention and Assistance Program, or FHPAP, provides emergency assistance to families that are at risk of homelessness, or who have already lost their housing.
Lawmakers have allocated between $7 and $10 million per year to the program between 2014 and 2023; during the 2023 legislative session, lawmakers directed $120 million to the FHPAP for 2024 and 2025. The House budget would give the program $50 million in 2026 and 2027; the Senate budget allocates $30 million.
Jenny Larson, executive director of Three Rivers Community Action, which manages FHPAP in several southern Minnesota counties, said despite state investments, the program is already oversubscribed. Her agency opens up a round of funding every quarter, and they are never able to help all of the families in need, Larson said. 
Brooklyn Park resident Ta-Metta Gaines, who lives in the embattled Huntington Place apartments, works as a customer service representative for a health care company. She fell behind on rent while dealing with medical issues, she said, and she’s looking for a new place to live as Huntington Place’s future is in limbo. 
When she became homeless after her landlord died, FHPAP helped her come up with a security deposit and first month’s rent to move into a new apartment. Now, FHPAP is helping her get caught up on past-due rent, and covering some of the cost of relocating, Gaines said.
“I’m just imagining what type of things can actually go on if they remove those funds, and how many people will be destitute,” Gaines said. 
Bonding
While the House housing budget authorizes the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency to issue $100 million in bonds to finance housing projects, lawmakers and Gov. Tim Walz have not agreed on targets for a bonding bill. 
Bonds are a tool governments use to finance infrastructure projects, including housing. Bonding bills require a 60% majority to pass the Legislature, so they require robust bipartisan support. 
Walz and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say they want to pass a bonding bill this session, in addition to the regular two-year budget. If the parties can’t make a deal on bonding — as was the case last year — the bonding in the housing budget is likely to be eliminated in conference committee.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mncapitol-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 10:08:23.621695

He’s hoping the bipartisan bill he introduced during a public hearing Tuesday afternoon will formalize and increase collaboration between agencies involved in grid planning. 
“I need to emphasize: the intent of this bill is not to interfere with the ongoing grid planning process,” Runte told the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee. Rather, its purpose is “to refine how it interacts with other initiatives and give it a bit of a tune up for future planning.” 
The grid is the system of transmission and distribution lines that bring electricity from where it is generated to the homes of ratepayers and other points of end use. 
Last summer, the Public Utilities Commission concluded its process of gathering input on priorities for grid plans. The largest privately owned utilities in the state, Central Maine Power and Versant Power, are required to submit their plans next January, Runte said. 
Meanwhile, the Governor’s Energy Office completed the state’s energy plan earlier this year that laid out pathways to achieve climate resilience and affordability goals. The portions of the plan that focused on electricity were based on a supply and demand forecast that considered reliability, emissions reductions, the role of emerging technologies and more, Runte explained. 
As Runte understands it, that forecast in the state’s energy plan looked circuit by circuit to develop a bottom-up analysis. However, the forecasting model used in the Public Utility Commission’s grid planning looks at capacity and load data from the regional grid, ISO-New England, taking a more top-down approach. 
Maine doubles down on commitment to address climate change with updated action plan

Given the connection between the state’s energy plan and future grid needs, Runte said he believes the agencies involved in grid planning should use the same load forecast. While LD 1726 calls for using the forecasting model in the state energy plan, Runte said he expects robust discussion on which of the two may be more appropriate. 
Public Advocate Heather Sanborn testified neither for nor against the bill, however, she raised concerns about limiting the forecast model over an uncertain amount of time because energy forecasting models are constantly evolving.
The bill also seeks to ensure that future planning considers grid enhancing technologies at the energy distribution level that could improve efficiency and reliability. To do that, the proposal would have the Public Utilities Commission consider adding incentives for improved data and grid monitoring of power quality reliability, the state of infrastructure, as well as capacity. 
Runte’s proposal also addresses the procurement of new energy sources. While the legislation covers multiple aspects of procurement, Runte said the bids for those new sources should be informed by the grid planning process to minimize the amount of new infrastructure. 
Another aspect of grid planning is energy demand management and non-wires alternatives — or projects that use alternative technology to avoid new investment in the transmission system. Currently, those two components are spread between three different agencies in Maine. Runte’s bill would ask the Public Utilities Commission, the Office of Public Advocate and Efficiency Maine to assess how those aspects of planning are shared among them and report back to the Legislature on how the process could be improved.
“The idea of this bill is to strengthen governance by establishing formal linkages to activities that have a direct impact on or perhaps should be subject to the findings of a grid plan,” Runte told the committee.
The Public Utilities Commission, as well as the Governor’s Energy Office, also offered neutral testimony on the proposal. Though legislative liaison Caroline Colan said the Governor’s Energy Office shares Runte’s goal of enhancing coordination where feasible in grid planning processes, she said some parts of the bill could be overly prescriptive.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s comparison of current prevalence rates to those from the 1980s or earlier ignores this historical context. Autistic people have always been here. We are simply doing a better job of recognizing and supporting them.
The post Autism is not an ‘epidemic,’ as RFK Jr. suggests appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has deeply alarmed us with his comments that repeat long-debunked theories, stigmatize people, and misrepresent everything about autism.  Instead of amplifying disinformation, we should be focusing on what really matters: recognizing the value of every person and ensuring that autistic people have the support and community they need to lead meaningful, connected lives. Calling autism an “epidemic” reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how autism is identified and diagnosed. An increase in diagnoses does not mean autism is dangerous.  It reflects decades of expanded awareness, broader diagnostic criteria, and improved access to services. It wasn’t until 1980 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual even included autism.  Since then, many people who would previously have gone undiagnosed or were misdiagnosed are now counted.   Kennedy’s comparison of current prevalence rates to those from the 1980s or earlier ignores this historical context. Autistic people have always been here. We are simply doing a better job of recognizing and supporting them. His claim that autistic individuals will “never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date” is not only false, but it demonstrates a lack of understanding of the complexity of autism. Our organization, the Association for Autism and Neurodiversity (AANE), is based in Watertown but supports thousands of autistic community members across the country who prove him wrong.  Many autistic adults have run the Boston Marathon. We see autistic employees thrive at work. Autistic writers publish their poetry. We have seen relationships blossom in our community and welcomed children of autistic parents. Autistic people are not one dimensional. As often as we see people thrive, we also acknowledge the deep distress and anxiety that loneliness, isolation, under- and unemployment bring. These challenges are exacerbated by systems that do not offer understanding, inclusion, or accommodation. The effort it takes to find providers or services that are attuned to autistic needs is often exhausting and requires persistence and patience.  Studies estimate that 70–95% of autistic individuals also experience mental health challenges, yet many give up after just one or two failed attempts to find a provider who understands autism. Autistic individuals with high support needs often face long waitlists, underfunded programs, staffing shortages, and inconsistent quality of care. These are solvable problems, but they are not solved by calling autism a “tragedy.”  Kennedy’s claim that autism, “is a preventable disease. We know it’s environmental exposure. It has to be,” simply isn’t true. Decades of peer-reviewed scientific research show that genetics are the primary factor in autism. Studies published in major journals and  reports from the National Institutes of Health consistently find that inherited genetic factors can account for anywhere between 40 to 80 percent of the risk for autism.  Kennedy acts like scientists have ignored environmental factors, but that’s not true. Researchers have spent decades studying them. What they’ve found is clear: Genetics are by far the strongest factor in autism, not any one exposure or event.  In fact, the newly formed Coalition of Autism Scientists, which was founded in Massachusetts, strongly critiqued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Autism Research Initiative. This group of experienced research scientists repudiated what it calls Kennedy’s “false narrative about the incidence and causes of autism” and expressed concern “to hear the Secretary of Health & Human Services dismiss past research [and] downplay the causal role of genes.” As the group’s leader, Dr. Helen Tager-Flusber, stated, “Instead of focusing on questions that have been asked and answered, limited and valuable research dollars must focus on what we don’t yet know about autism so that we can meet the urgent needs of autism individuals and their families.” We cannot let outdated thinking shape national policy. Our leaders must reject disinformation. They need to center the voices and experiences of autistic individuals and their families. We should all want a future where every individual, regardless of neurology, is valued, supported, and empowered to thrive.  Brenda Dater is the executive director of the Association for Autism and Neurodiversity (AANE), a  Watertown, MA based organization that provides education and support for autistic and neurodivergent people and their families. The post Autism is not an ‘epidemic,’ as RFK Jr. suggests appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Autism_RFK-Jr.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

Photo by Christopher MichelVTDigger announced Wednesday that Geeta Anand, a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist, author and university dean, has been named the organization’s next editor-in-chief.Anand has worked as a journalist for nearly 30 years as a foreign correspondent in India for The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, covered City Hall for the Boston Globe, and wrote “The Cure,” a book about a father’s fight to find a cure for his terminally sick children, which was adapted into the film, “Extraordinary Measures” starring Harrison Ford. Most recently, she served as dean of the University of California Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.In the early 1990s, Anand covered southern Vermont and the City of Rutland for The Rutland Herald, where she uncovered across-the-board errors in Vermont by one of the nation’s biggest credit reporting companies, prompting Congress to pass a new law.Eager to hone her investigative reporting skills, Anand eventually left the Herald for bigger news publications. But even as she did so, she promised her husband, Greg Kroitzsh, a Vermonter whose parents ran the Salt Ash Inn in Plymouth, that they would return one day in the future, when she hoped to bring all of her skills and experience to lead a news publication. “This job is really coming full circle for Greg and me,” Anand said. “It has always been our dream to come back to Vermont, and this job gives us the chance to do that in a way that is truly meaningful as a journalist and journalism leader.” In her role at VTDigger, Anand will lead the 20-plus VTDigger newsroom to excel in its mission to produce rigorous journalism that explains complex issues, promotes public accountability and fosters democratic and civic engagement.“I look forward to working with VTDigger’s staff and board to develop a bold and ambitious vision for our newsroom’s future,” Anand said.“We will together find a way to enable our newsroom to take on the biggest, boldest investigative projects while also continuing to cover the most important news in our state,” she said. “My first task will be mentoring and supporting our editorial staff in achieving these goals while also leading sustainable lives.”“I will also relish supporting CEO Sky Barsch in raising the funds to make VTDigger’s journalism sustainable, and in continuing to create a supportive newsroom culture,” she continued. “It is fundamental to enabling our reporters and editors having the emotional resilience to produce courageous journalism over the long term.”Barsch said Anand’s appointment marks a defining moment for Vermont journalism, one that will shape the future of independent news in the state.“Geeta Anand is not only one of the most extraordinary journalists of our time, she’s also a visionary with a gift for inspiring and empowering those around her,” Barsch said. “The excitement we feel about her joining our team is matched only by the impact her leadership will have on the state of Vermont.”  Gaye Symington, president of the Vermont Journalism Trust, VTDigger’s parent organization, highlighted the importance of VTDigger’s new editorial leadership.“That a leader of Geeta’s caliber is eager to move across the country to lead VTDigger’s newsroom is a powerful testament to the quality of our journalism and its impact on Vermont,” Symington said.Anand’s first day with VTDigger is July 1.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Geeta Anand named editor-in-chief of VTDigger.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Geeta-Anand-by-Christopher-Michel-290405-5-9-23_cropped.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

“My kids were five and seven. I was just thinking about whether or not I would live long enough to be able to dance with my sons at their weddings,” Batch recalled at a Tuesday press conference.
Batch, a primary sponsor of Senate Bill 553, said the “Save More Tatas Act” would provide health coverage parity for breast cancer diagnostic imaging.
Far too many women in North Carolina don’t get diagnosed with breast cancer early, because they don’t get the proper diagnostic treatment and preventative treatment that would save their lives.
“Most importantly, you sure as heck shouldn’t be in a situation where women are denied access because they can’t afford the actual screenings,” said Sen. Batch.
‘Divine intervention’
Sen. Val Applewhite (D-Cumberland) said when she retired from the United States Air Force after 20 years, she received a screening mammogram as she was processed out of the military. It came back normal.

A year later she credits divine intervention with saving her life.
“My mother, who had passed years earlier, came to me in my dream. She said, ‘Val, go get a mammogram.’ So, I made the appointment. And that’s when I got the diagnosis, I had breast cancer. I was lucky.”
Applewhite was lucky that she was working at the Pentagon. She received her cancer treatment at Bethesda Naval Medical Center, the same place the President of the United States receives medical care.
“That access, plain and simple, is what saved my life. Too many people in North Carolina don’t have that,” said Applewhite.
The Cumberland County Democrat said another portion of SB 553 would allocate $3.5 million to help recruit and retain mammography technologists in rural and underserved areas.
Skipping tests when you can’t afford the co-pay
Rep. Mary Belk (D-Mecklenburg) is yet another member of this extraordinary sorority of breast cancer survivors.

Belk said she had finished a grueling day of campaigning in 2016 when she felt something.
She didn’t want to call it a lump. That was too scary. But she made time for an overdue breast exam.
“I heard the words that no one wants to hear:  You have breast cancer,” said Belk. “I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer, three months before my first election.”
Approximately 14,700 women in North Carolina will have breast cancer this year. Fourteen hundred will not survive, Belk said.
But with first rate care, her cancer went into remission. She was one of the lucky few who did not worry about the cost of imaging.
“Women who need these medically necessary tests are skipping them because they cannot afford the co-pays,” said Belk.
Breast MRIs in North Carolina can cost anywhere between $260 and over $1,300, depending on one’s health plan.
Belk is the primary sponsor of House Bill 297. The Breast Cancer Prevention Imaging Parity bill would require insurance companies to cover diagnostic, screening as well as supplemental breast exams to the same extent as mammograms.
This coverage is especially important for women with dense breasts who are at risk of being diagnosed at later stages.
Causing a ‘ruckus’ for advanced imaging
Sheila Mikhail falls into that category. The self-described ‘serial, biotech entrepreneur’ created multiple companies in the Research Triangle Park along with thousands of well-paying jobs.

Yet when cancer was found in her left breast, she repeatedly had to push for additional screenings of her right breast.
The oncologist told her she was causing a ‘ruckus’, but the office would do a supplemental test at a cost of $1,200.
The breast MRI found a second tumor that was not detected by an ultrasound or a diagnostic mammogram.
“I was fortunate because I could afford to pay. I found my right tumor just before it metastasized.”
Mikhail wants lawmakers to pass both HB 297 and SB 553 and have insurance companies cover supplemental ultrasounds and MRIs for breast cancer.
A narrow window to gain passage
But the time to pass these bills this session is growing short. May 8th marks the crossover deadline for bills to pass at least one chamber to stay eligible for consideration.
Senate Bill 553 has been stuck in the Rules committee since March.
Belk’s bill (“Breast Cancer Prevention Imaging Parity”) was approved by three House committees, but before a floor vote in mid-April, it was withdrawn from the House calendar and kicked back to the Rules committee. No reason was provided.
Batch said she has had many, many conversations with her Republican colleagues, but faces opposition because some insurance companies don’t want another mandate that requires them to pay for additional coverage.
Sen. Applewhite said this should not be a partisan issue. She’d like female voters to call their representatives.
“You know our breasts are not Democrats or Republicans, but the men in this building that have power, don’t help us — won’t help us save lives. We should be mad as hell.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages_breastcancer-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

The original proposal would have mandated phonics instruction in K-12 classrooms. The latest version makes that optional. 


A bill that could reshape literacy education in California elementary schools cleared a major hurdle in the Legislature this week after dueling sides reached a compromise that provides funding for phonics-based instruction but stops short of requiring it. 
The compromise between English learner advocates and those who back the so-called “science of reading” or “evidence-based” approach provides funding and support for phonics-focused instruction, but doesn’t require schools or teachers to participate.

Fight over phonics: Will California require the ‘science of reading’ in schools? 

by Carolyn Jones 





Still, the legislative language, which was added to an existing bill, represents an important milestone in the fight over how schools teach children to read. For years, arguments over phonics have stalled progress on literacy policy, even as statewide reading scores have remained stubbornly low.   
“It’s exciting for California. A lot of work went into this, and it shows opposing sides can come together and find solutions,” said Marshall Tuck, director of EdVoice, an education nonprofit. “This will be a really good thing for California kids.”
The bill, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina, and Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance, requires the state to provide training for teachers and instructional materials centered on phonics-focused literacy instruction, which includes vocabulary, comprehension, the ability to sound words out and other literacy basics. The materials and training must also address the specific needs of English learners, who make up about 18% of the state’s 5.8 million K-12 students.
“We recognize the role of the Legislature in proposing solutions to improve literacy that uplifts the unique needs of multilingual learners and honors their home languages and cultures — which is why we are proud to support AB 1454,” said Martha Hernandez, director of Californians Together, an English learner advocacy group, in a statement.
Tuck said he’s confident most schools will opt to use the new instructional materials and send their teachers to learn the ins-and-outs of teaching phonics, because they’ll want to take advantage of the funding. He said he’s not overly fazed by the fact that the material isn’t required. 
Previous opposition
Previous bills to require a phonics-based approach have died, in part because not everyone agrees that phonics is the best way to teach students whose first language isn’t English. Hernandez’s group has argued that those students need an approach that gives equal weight to vocabulary and oral language development in addition to phonics.
The California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union, has fought reading instruction mandates in the past, saying teachers — not legislators — are in the best position to assess the needs of individual students, and they need maximum flexibility in the classroom. The union has so far been neutral on this bill.
Research has shown that most students learn to read through explicit instruction focused on sounding words out, alongside lessons in vocabulary and comprehension. The other primary approach emphasizes sight reading, in which students memorize whole words and piece together meaning through context. 
Nearly 40 states have required phonics-based reading instruction in recent years. Some school districts in California, including Los Angeles Unified, the largest district in the state, already use curricula that’s focused on phonics. But about 80% of districts don’t, according to research by the California Reading Coalition, a literacy advocacy group.  
Stalled reading scores
California’s reading scores were steadily climbing before the pandemic, but fell during remote learning and have stalled since then. Almost 60% of third graders weren’t reading at grade level last year, with some student groups, including Black and low-income students, lagging even further behind. By fourth grade students should be reading well enough to easily understand content, according to the state’s literacy standards.
The bill, scheduled for a hearing today, was originally introduced in February but its primary focus was on school heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems. Advocates tacked on the literacy component this week, which is detailed in the bill analysis and will likely be incorporated into the bill language later this week. It replaces a previous bill, also sponsored by Rubio, that died last week. 
Because the bill is sponsored by the Assembly speaker, it’s expected to pass the Assembly. Any bill that costs money may face an uphill battle in the current economic climate, but Gov. Gavin Newsom has supported literacy efforts in the past.

Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, listens to a presentation on the proposed amendment to the Alaska Constitution on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska lawmakers confront a major budget deficit, legislators’ opposing views on possible solutions appear likely to lead to a lower Permanent Fund dividend and cuts to services, including public schools.
In public statements, members of the Alaska Senate’s majority caucus have said they oppose spending from savings to balance the budget and want to see new revenue bills instead.
Meanwhile, members of the state House and Gov. Mike Dunleavy have said they oppose new revenue bills and would prefer to spend from savings.
Those different positions leave only budget cuts — to public services and the dividend — as the way to balance the budget.
“It’s still a very dynamic conversation right now. … We can clearly see we don’t have enough funds to pay for everything,” said Rep. Bill Elam, R-Nikiski. 
“In the absence of revenue, the PFD is going to go away. An affordable PFD this year is like $500,” said Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage.
As it prepares its draft of the state’s operating budget, the Alaska Senate’s finance committee has already stripped out all spending increases proposed by the state House in its draft budget, and it has nixed most of the increases requested by Dunleavy.
Even after cutting more than $200 million from a budget draft approved by the House, the Senate Finance draft budget has a deficit of at least $70 million — and possibly much more, depending on the results of ongoing labor negotiations and other factors.
Next on the chopping block is the dividend, set at $1,400 per recipient by the House.
“I believe, because of the tightness of this year’s budget, we are looking at reducing that further, but no further than $1,000,” Hoffman said.
That reduction would save close to $420 million, he told reporters on Tuesday, but the size of the reduction hasn’t been finalized.
While legislators have not agreed on a new formula to set the dividend, the amounts each of the past two years were based on 25% of the annual draws from the Permanent Fund, a share supported by some senators since at least 2017. Reducing the dividend below $1,400 would end that practice.
With three weeks left in the Legislature’s regular session, the Senate has passed one revenue bill — modifying the state’s corporate income tax for big Internet companies like Amazon — and two others remain in committee.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, confirmed that the Senate will not pass the biggest revenue proposal this year: a reduction in the per-barrel tax credit given to oil companies as part of the state’s oil tax system.
That leaves only a change to the taxation of privately held companies like Hilcorp, the North Slope oil firm, on the Senate’s docket. 
Even if both bills were to pass the Legislature and gain Dunleavy’s approval, the combined gain to the state treasury would be the equivalent of less than $200 for the Permanent Fund dividend.
On top of that, the odds of the House passing and the governor allowing both revenue bills appear low.
In a March opinion column published by the Anchorage Daily News, House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, joined 15 members of the Republican House minority in opposing two of the three Senate bills.
Asked why Alaskans should endure a PFD cut to avoid higher taxes on those companies, Kopp said on April 8, “Right now, our oil and gas industry is recovering from the COVID-19 setback and we are currently on the verge of a renaissance in the energy industry. … I don’t want to kill an energy renaissance when it is just forming, coming online and showing tremendous promise.”
The House’s majority caucus has only 21 members, meaning that Kopp’s opposition would require the majority to have the support of at least one member of the House’s Republican minority in order to advance one of the oil-related bills. 
But even if a bill were to pass the House and Senate, Dunleavy would still have to OK it.
“I told legislative leadership, I’m not interested in new taxes. I’m not interested in a program that taxes and spends, taxes and spends,” the governor told reporters during a news conference earlier this month.
As an alternative to cutting the dividend and services, the Legislature could unlock the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a $2.8 billion savings account. Lawmakers are already planning to do so in order to cover a $200 million shortfall in the current year’s budget.
But on Tuesday, members of the Senate’s majority caucus reiterated their opposition to that idea.
As bad as the state’s budget situation is this year, it’s likely to be worse next year, said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee. 
“We’re very concerned (about) any access to the CBR this year … because the concern is next year, it’s highly likely we’re going to need it,” he said.
Between federal budget cuts and depressed oil prices, the problems that the state is facing now will be repeated next year, both Stedman and Hoffman said. That’s when the Legislature will debate the budget to cover the fiscal year from July 2026 to June 2027.
“That is also an integral part of what we’re having dialogue on — positioning the state for the FY27 budget a year from now, so we’re not … halfway down a cliff, heading for a final stop,” Stedman said.

About 4 million Californians live in what Cal Fire categorizes as “high” or “very high” fire danger zones. With the state’s ongoing housing crunch, our penchant to build and rebuild homes in high-risk areas also won’t stop anytime soon.
Following the deadly Los Angeles County wildfires, home hardening — or the process of making homes resistant against fire — is considered by some state lawmakers, insurance companies, housing developers and fire experts as one of the crucial strategies the state should take to avoid the next wildfire catastrophe, writes CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.
One home developer, KB Home, is in the process of building an entire subdivision of fire-resistant homes north of San Diego County. 
But retrofitting old homes is an expensive endeavor, and with no statewide plan in place, fortifying California homes en masse will be an uphill battle for legislators and local governments alike.
Hardening, say, a two-story, 2,000 square-foot single family home could cost between $2,000 to over $100,000, according to the independent research group Headwater Economics. Despite the high price tag, experts argue that compared to losing an entire home by fire, it’s a necessary cost to pay.

Yana Valachovic, a forest health and fire expert with the University of California: “Fuels management and home hardening are just as important as a remodeled kitchen at this point.”

Some local governments, such as Marin County and the city of Novato, offer grants and incentives to homeowners to harden their dwellings and clear vegetation. Insurance companies also offer minor discounts to homeowners who make certain home-hardening investments or join neighborhood disaster preparedness groups. 
At the state level, California is carrying out a $117 million pilot wildfire mitigation program. Launched in 2019, the program has so far retrofitted 21 homes and has enough funding to harden about 2,000 homes. The pilot is currently set to expire in 2029, though the Legislature is considering a bill to make it permanent.
Lawmakers have also proposed two other related bills: One would redirect some of the tax revenue the state collects from property insurers to go towards a home-hardening grant program; and another that would create a state-run hardening certification program.

Should children have access to AI?

Following the death of a 14-year-old who killed himself last year after forming a deep relationship with an online chatbot, California lawmakers are considering two bills that seek to curb the use of artificial intelligence-powered companion bots by children, reports CalMatters’ Khari Johnson.
Senate Bill 243 would require chatbot developers to adopt standards for how to address conversations about self harm. Another measure would require developers to review and label AI systems based on their risk to kids and ban the use of emotionally manipulative chatbots.
A joint report released today by the children’s advocacy group Common Sense Media and the Stanford University School of Medicine found that companion bots mimic what users input, and are quick to engage in racist jokes and sexual roleplay. The assessment also finds that bots can worsen depression, anxiety, feelings of isolation and other mental health issues in young users. 
But some argue that these bills threaten the right to free speech and privacy. The California Chamber of Commerce and the Electronic Frontier Foundation both oppose SB 243. In a letter to one legislator, the foundation said the bill in its current form, which requires age verification, “would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.”

CA entering legal battles against Trump at twice previous pace

Since his return to the White House, President Donald Trump has issued over 130 executive orders that seek to scale back the reach of the federal government and unbraid the progressive governmental framework set forth by some of his predecessors, writes CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
For California, that is likely to mean long legal battles ahead as state officials work to defend California’s existing policies against the administration.
Some of Trump’s orders include imposing tariffs, revoking birthright citizenship and limiting voting rights. In March, J. Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, defended the administration’s actions as “hopeful developments for the rule of law,” because they challenge federal agencies’ ability to insulate themselves from “presidential supervision.”
Meanwhile, the state has set aside $50 million for legal battles against the administration. So far, it has also filed or joined 16 lawsuits, with the latest lawsuit filed Tuesday challenging the administration’s cuts to AmeriCorps.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta: “The comparison with Trump 1.0 shows that it is high volume, high speed (this time). We’ve brought a lawsuit more than once a week in the first hundred days, and during Trump 1.0 there were about 120 lawsuits over four years. We’re gonna hit around 100 at this rate in two years, so it’s almost double the pace.”

And lastly: Committee chair pulls rent cap bill

Remember last week when dozens of tenant rights advocates and aggrieved landlords packed into an Assembly committee room to alternately cheer on and decry a bill that would have drastically limited how much landlords can hike the rent on their tenants each year?
We have an update: Never mind.
On Tuesday, Assemblymember Ash Kalra said that he would be withdrawing Assembly Bill 1157 from consideration this year, saying in a press release that “more time is needed to work on the bill.” 
Translation: He didn’t have the votes in the Assembly’s judiciary committee. The San Jose Democrat is the chairperson of that committee, so that really says something about the fervency of opposition to the bill — from landlords, moderate Democrats and possibly even the Assembly Speaker himself.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: A California bill to create a state-owned nonprofit that would provide financing for infrastructure projects may yet be another example of lawmakers proposing major programs without fully understanding the risks.
The recent death of a girl who killed herself after bullies threatened to have her parents deported underscores how incendiary rhetoric surrounding immigration can be dangerous, writes Carielle Escalante, an advocate for survivors of gender-based violence.

Detroit Area Youth Uniting Michigan student organizer Demetrius Davis said the books that are banned are often those featuring representation for oppressed groups.
“We the people reject the erasure of our stories and the whitewashing of our curricula,” Davis said.

Davis said the book bans are also meant to limit information to benefit those in power.
“They yearn to keep us ignorant,” Davis said. “They call true education dangerous and savage. The most dangerous thing you can be under a fascist regime is well educated.”
Michigan Education Justice Coalition youth organizer Imani Clark said the book bans are a threat to the wellbeing of students.
“Unsafe schools, both physically and mentally, are important to address for students,” Clark said.
Protesters said another part of that threat is a lack of funding for schools.
Grand Rapids Student Association for Leadership and Transformation student advocate Abigail Valdivia-Romero said that each floor in her school building has a television for displaying announcements.
“A healthy, nutritious lunch is way more important than watching announcements on a screen,” Valdivia-Romero said. “When our current school lunches are not nutritious, healthy or even appetizing, a lot of students go throughout the entire day without eating, and the only thing they can think about when they get home is what they’re going to eat. Having an empty stomach all day makes it harder to focus, to think clearly, to learn.”
Clark said the lack of adequate funding for schools is “all encompassing.”

Detroit student Nabiha Chowdhury, who is part of 482Forward Youth Organizing Collective, said that additional funding allows schools to offer better resources for students, including in the types of content they teach.
“Money gives schools the tools they need – and gives students access to the books, support and opportunities they deserve,” Chowdhury said.
Students had planned to attend House session and deliver a petition to the office of Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) but were disappointed to discover that session had been cancelled, leading to chants outside Hall’s office on the first floor of the Capitol.

Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine, during a legislative hearing Tuesday, April 29, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol. It would have given every parish the right to determine whether projects focused on carbon capture and sequestration could occu, but a committee rejected the proposal. (Louisiana House of Representatives video capture).Two young members of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana are speaking out after state lawmakers voted Tuesday against a bill they say was important to their land, culture and safety.
Allie Johnson, 20, and Marianna Sickey, 16, spoke in support of House Bill 4, by Rep. Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine. It would have given every parish the right to determine whether projects focused on carbon capture and sequestration could occur. ExxonMobil has proposed drilling wells to store carbon dioxide underground less than one mile from the Coushatta reservation, according to the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources.
The two were among the youngest to testify during a House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment hearing at the State Capitol, where a host of bills dealing with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) were considered.
In phone interviews with the Illuminator after the hearing, Johnson and Sickey said official communication with the Coushatta community about CCS plans impacting their tribal land has been lacking.

Sickey, who attends high school in Lake Charles, said many of her peers were unaware of the proposed CCS projects. 
“More people my age should be aware of this,” she said. “This affects us, and we had no idea.”
“We haven’t been given opportunities to tell the youth because they want to keep it hush hush on the reservation,” Johnson said.
One proposed well site for the ExxonMobil CCS site would be approximately half a mile from Coushatta’s preschool and tribal housing. 
“This is land that has deep cultural ties to our people,” Johnson said. “It is land that we cannot just move away from or leave. Our land is sacred. It is our homes, our ancestors, our futures, and it connects me and others to all that it was before. 
“It is a place that I hope more generations get to enjoy and live on. But right now, it seems that it’s being threatened.”
Sickey attended the preschool and said many of the Coushatta words she knows today are remnants of what she was taught there.
“When you’re on the reservation at all, like there’s language in danger, all of their lives are in danger, their heritage. If anything were to happen, it would be detrimental to the tribe,” Sickey said. 
Johnson, who greeted committee members in the Coushatta tongue, worries about the lack of safety data for long-term carbon dioxide storage and the financial incentives that can cloud judgment. While Louisiana’s fossil fuel sector is well versed in the drilling needed for CCS, the storage element is new ground for a state where some 30 such projects are planned.    
“This is an experiment they’re putting on our soil,” Johnson said. “There’s no way to guarantee that it’s safe.”
CCS proponents have said the process is safe as long as carbon gases are stored and maintained properly. The biggest risks are from leakage, including with the pipelines that transport CO2 from the industrial facilities where it’s captured and send it to sequestration sites.
Five years ago, some 200 people were forced to evacuate their homes after a CO2 pipeline explosion in Sartaria, Mississippi. Exposure to the odorless, colorless gas put 45 people in the hospital. 
A year ago, Calcasieu Parish residents were unaware that a CO pipeline near their homes had ruptured. No injuries or illnesses were reported as police shut down access to the area, but neighbors said they only learned about the incident hours later from social media. There were no warning sirens or an alert system in place.
The company that owns both pipelines, Denbury Inc., is a subsidiary of ExxonMobil.    
Despite the failure of Owen’s bill, both Sickey and Johnson say they are committed to continuing the fight against CCS on their homeland.
“This is something we will not be quiet about,” Johnson said. “Even if these bills are denied, they try to sweep us under the rug, and they try anything in their power to silence us. … The good fight will keep going on, at the end of the day, until justice is served.”

Now what about the rest of California?,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/04/california-fire-home-hardening/,Dixon Trail is the first purpose-built “wildfire resilient neighborhood” in the United States. Making that a reality for the millions of Californians who already live in harm’s way is a daunting and costly challenge that lawmakers are only just beginning to grapple with.,"In summary
Dixon Trail is the first purpose-built “wildfire resilient neighborhood” in the United States. Making that a reality for the millions of Californians who already live in harm’s way is a daunting and costly challenge that lawmakers are only just beginning to grapple with. 



The homes in the half-built subdivision look a lot like all the others nestled up against the parched, shrubby hills of Escondido, north San Diego County.
But look a little closer. The gutters and vents are enclosed in a thin, wire mesh. Each window is double-paned, the glass tempered to withstand the heat of a wildfire, the stucco around the shutters resistant to flame. The privacy fences, a suburban staple, look like wood, but are actually brown-tinted steel. Every foundation sits behind a moat of gravel.
National mega-developer KB Home is marketing Dixon Trail as the first purpose-built “wildfire resilient neighborhood” in the United States. The next time fire rips through the chaparral in surrounding hills (a question of when, not if) this cluster of homes is being built to keep the flames at the subdivision’s edge. 
Though only half of the 64 homes have been constructed, the development had its grand opening earlier this month. No one from KB would say as much, but in purely marketing terms, the timing couldn’t have been better. For years, wildfire-resilient home and neighborhood design has been a niche consideration for many California homeowners. January’s Los Angeles firestorms have made it feel more like an urgent necessity.
“Buyers want to feel safe in their homes and this is a really big plus for them,” said Steve Ruffner, who oversees KB projects across the region.
The design of each house and the layout of the entire subdivision — with healthy buffers between each building and scant flammable vegetation — meet standards set by the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, a research nonprofit funded by the insurance industry. The institute began issuing its “wildfire prepared” designations to homes in 2022. Think organic certification on produce, except for homes built to withstand wildfire.
This is the first time the institute plans to give its stamp of approval to an entire neighborhood.
Building a fire resilient home from scratch is one thing. Bringing older homes up to that heightened standard is a more daunting and costly challenge — and one that California lawmakers at the state and local level are only beginning to grapple with. 
Millions of Californians already live in tinderbox canyons and at the edges of shrub fields and overgrown forests. An unknown number live in homes built before 2008, when the state introduced its wildfire-minded building code for new construction in high hazard areas. Some home-hardening retrofits are cheap and DIY-able. Others less so. A report from 2024 by the independent research group Headwater Economics put the cost to harden a two-story, 2,000 square-foot single family home at anywhere from $2,000 to “more than $100,000.”
Karen Collins, vice president of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, calls these retrofits “pre-disaster mitigation” measures. As wildfires grow more severe and costly, these measures can offer “a huge return on investment from what is otherwise spent at the loss,” she said. Translated from insurance speak: Replacing a roof before a fire is cheaper than replacing an entire house afterward.
“But yes, to retrofit and put on new roofs and new siding, that gets into the multiple tens of thousands of dollars, so there’s a public policy trade off,” she said. “Like, how do we do this?”

Some local governments — albeit not many — offer grants and incentives to fire-wary homeowners hoping to make these upgrades. 
The insurance industry is beginning to offer discounts to some homeowners who make firewise changes, though the promised savings are often smaller than many homeowners expect or demand. 
There aren’t any statewide plans to help harden California’s housing stock en masse, though a pilot project is underway and the Legislature is considering a few other ideas.
Beyond changes in policy, California homeowners, planners, real estate agents and developers may need to change the way they think about wildfire risk, said Yana Valachovic, a forest health and fire expert with the University of California. Rather than viewing home hardening as a luxury expense, or even a necessary cost that must be begrudgingly assumed, such protections might just need to become standard features of homeownership across the increasingly fire-prone American West. 
“It needs to be spoken about in the advertisement of the house, because these are all keys to insurability and the protection of your investment,” said Valachovic. “Fuels management and home hardening are just as important as a remodeled kitchen at this point.”
A fireproof home?
Home-hardening experts try to think like embers in a windstorm.
Open eaves (the cavities beneath a roof’s overhang); vents that lead into an attic; wood decks; wood shingles; wood fences; and any plants, lawn furniture, cars, sheds and trash bins stowed right up against the house — all of these present an inviting array of nooks and crannies in which embers can settle and smolder. Hardening a home means covering them up, replacing material that burns with material that doesn’t, and clearing a five-foot non-combustible buffer around the house, an area state regulators call “zone zero”  
Ember-proofing alone isn’t always enough. In urban conflagrations, like the ones in Los Angeles, flames go horizontal in the gale-force winds, turning a burning home into a blow-torch trained upon its neighbors. The sheer heat radiating off of a burning structure can warp and melt window frames 20 feet away.
In those conditions, cement siding and tempered-glass can give a home a fighting chance.

When the Insurance Institute conducted a formal forensic survey in Los Angeles, they found repeated examples of homes where a single double-paned tempered glass window, a stucco wall or a walkway free of decorative plants likely kept the flames at bay. 
Experts turn to the surviving homes for lessons after every major fire. In Maui, after the Lahaina waterfront burned in 2023, images of a single red-roofed home, lonely and seemingly untouched, went viral. Reporting later revealed that just prior to the disaster, the homeowners replaced the roof with a thick metal one and removed its surrounding vegetation. They were trying to keep out termites, not flames, but fire doesn’t consider motive.
There may be no such thing as a fire-proof house, but if vulnerability to disaster is a numbers game, home hardening — like seat belts, bike helmets and vaccines — can up the odds of survival.
Pilots and programs
The closest thing California has to a statewide home hardening campaign at the moment is a $117 million pilot project. 
The California Wildfire Mitigation Program, run jointly by the California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) and the governor’s Office of Emergency Services, is funding half a dozen neighborhood-wide retrofits in especially fire-prone and economically distressed corners of the state. 
The program seeks to tackle the problem of fire resilience at a community scale. Managing wildfire risk is a bit like managing an infectious disease: There’s only so much a single homeowner can do if their neighbors are unprotected.
“Fuels management and home hardening are just as important as a remodeled kitchen at this point.”Yana Valachovic, forest health and fire expert, University of California
The pilot was launched by the legislature in 2019, but is only just beginning to get off the ground. So far, 21 homes have been retrofitted: 19 in Kelseyville, Lake County and two in Dulzura, east of San Diego. Neighborhoods in the Sierra foothills and California’s far north are still working through the start-up and permitting process.
Each house presents its own array of costly challenges. New roofs, new siding, new windows, replacing decks, cleaning brush. “We don’t want to just kinda harden the home,” said Deanna Fernweh, program manager for the Lake County project. 
This is new terrain for the state and the pilot has run into plenty of unexpected complications along the way. Fire-resistant materials are a specialty product that can be hard to source, particularly if you need something to be just the right size. Local contractors don’t always know much about fire risk, nor do the local permitting officials. Some counties require construction workers to be paid union-level wages. With most of the money coming from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the work is also subject to rigorous environmental standards. Any work done in the spring and summer has to wait on nest surveys to ensure that construction doesn’t disturb migratory or endangered birds.

All of that adds to the price tag. The cheapest retrofit so far has come in at roughly $36,000, said J. Lopez, executive director of the statewide program. That was a tidy, well-maintained home in Kelseyville. The most expensive so far was $110,000. At current funding levels, the program is on track to harden roughly 2,000 homes.
That’s not likely to put a noticeable dent in the total number of vulnerable homes across the state. But Lopez said part of the goal of the pilot is to figure out just how expensive, delay-ridden and generally annoying it is to harden a neighborhood — and then figure out ways to make it all less so. 
“When the VCR first came out, I think the first ones were about $1,500,” he said. “I leave it to American ingenuity to come up with solutions — and we are part of that, helping move that along.”
The pilot is currently set to expire in 2029, though the Legislature is considering a bill to make it permanent. Future funding remains an open question. So far FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Assistance Grant program, which provides much of the funding for the California program, has been spared the cuts that have felled other emergency response and preparedness initiatives under the Trump administration.
Legislators may also take up legislation this year to shave off some of the tax revenue the state currently collects from property insurers and redirect it toward a grant program for fire-resistant roofs and vegetation management work. Another bill would create a “Community Hardening Commission” inside the state’s Department of Insurance to be tasked with recommending new home hardening rules and improving old ones. A third bill would create a state-run home hardening certification program, with the hope being that insurers will be more likely to cover a home with the state’s imprimatur. 
“Almost everyone knows what the things are that we have to do with home hardening,” Assemblymember Steve Bennett, an Oxnard Democrat and the author of that certification bill, said at a budget committee hearing in February. “We’ve talked about it and talked about it, but we’re not really making much progress.”
Locals step up
Absent a comprehensive statewide hardening program, some cities are trying to fill the gaps. 
In 2020, Marin County voted overwhelmingly to tax itself to fund a countywide wildfire prevention program. The program shells out roughly $20 million each year on individualized home safety assessments, home hardening and vegetation clearing grants and evacuation route clearing operations. 
In the city of Novato, the local fire district has used those funds to inspect every house in town. Homeowners can apply for matching grants — up $1,500 for home hardening and $1,000 for brush clearing. 
Sometimes that’s enough to cover the cost of the work. Vent screens aren’t expensive, and vegetation management can be cheap if a homeowner is willing to do the work themselves.

But often the grants aren’t nearly enough to cover all the called-for work. In Novato at least, a financial nudge is often all that people need, said Fire Marshal Lynne Osgood. According to data collected by the fire district over the last fiscal year, the city doled out half a million dollars in these matching grants to fund home-hardening projects; homeowners spend four times that amount.
“(Novato homeowners) are getting pressure from the insurance companies, they’re seeing, year after year, major conflagrations where thousands upon thousands of people are losing their homes,” Osgood said. “They are highly motivated.” 
Where Marin County is offering carrots, other cities are using sticks. Across the Bay, the city of Berkeley just passed its own “zone zero” regulations which will require hill-dwelling residents to keep the five feet around their homes free of plants, wood fencing and other flammable odds and ends. The new policy will go into effect at the beginning of next year when it will be enforced with the possibility of daily fines.
That’s a few years ahead of the rest of the state. Cal Fire is scrambling to cobble together specific “zone zero” regulations for all high hazard areas, something a state law directed them to do by 2023. In February, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order directing the department to “accelerate” its regulatory process and produce a final rule by the end of the year. The most recent draft of the regulations would give homeowners three years to comply.

Byers Enterprises has run a steady roofing business out of Grass Valley, just west of the Tahoe National Forest, since the late 1980s. In 2022, it started a specific division for home hardening. 
“We’re seeing a real groundswell of interest,” said Jeff Fierstein, the company’s general manager. Some of that interest is due to the Los Angeles fires, which put fire risk top of mind for many. 
But he said roughly half of his customers are turning to him out of duress. “The insurance companies are saying ‘Do this or you’re done,’” he said.
Not every fire-prone jurisdiction has Marin’s resources or Berkeley’s political appetite for new mandates. For the majority of Californians living in the so-called wildland urban interface, the most powerful nudge toward home hardening comes in the form of an insurance company’s premium hike or non-renewal notice.
A regulation from 2023 is forcing California insurers to offer discounts to homeowners who make certain home hardening investments or join Firewise communities, voluntary neighborhood disaster preparedness groups. But the approval process has been slow, the discounts vary from carrier to carrier, the requirements coming from insurers don’t always match the state’s own standards and the savings on offer are, according to some, miserly. 
California property insurers are not in an especially discounting mood. After a decade of staggering wildfire-related losses, surging inflation and what the industry has long characterized as a sclerotic regulatory environment that doesn’t allow them to cover their costs, many carriers are looking for any excuse to drop California customers. 
That dour climate might begin to change soon, said Janet Ruiz, a spokesperson for the industry association, the Insurance Information Institute. The state’s Department of Insurance is rolling out a series of policy changes aimed at enticing insurers back into the market. That overhaul “should bring more insurance companies into writing more policies,” putting them on a stronger financial footing and making them more willing to cut certain homeowners a break.

Even with the right regulations in place, insurers aren’t known for embracing change, said Dave Jones, California’s former Department of Insurance head who now runs the Climate Risk Initiative at UC Berkeley’s law school. 
Earlier this month, Jones and the nonprofit Nature Conservancy released a new, first-of-its-kind insurance policy for Tahoe-Donner, one of the country’s largest homeowners associations. In exchange for years of tree thinning and brush clearing work, the Truckee-based HOA will receive nearly 40% off on its insurance policy. 
“It’s a very conservative industry,” he said. “You need to show them that an insurer is able to (make money doing this) before others will follow suit.” 
The upside: The new policy shows that at least one insurer — in this case, Globe Underwriting, based in London — believes it can account for the reduced risk that comes with certain wildfire mitigation efforts and then pass some of those savings onto customers. 
The downside: The policy only covers commonly held land, not individual homes and, at least for now, the Nature Conservancy is footing the $55,000 annual premium.
“The big success here is that the insurance policy was written at all because this is an area where insurers are pulling out and it was written because of the forest treatment work that the homeowners association is undertaking,” said Jones. 
Whether it’s forest management programs, zone zero mandates or home hardening grants, the public is only going to support these taxpayer-funded initiatives if they start to open up the insurance market and bring down premiums, he said. 
“Part of what we’re trying to do here is demonstrate that this can be done, convince insurers to do it, but also continue to build public support for these necessary investments,” said Jones. “Because this stuff is not inexpensive to do.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042425_Dixon-Trail_AH_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

Free.,"Deportations, tariffs and federal workforce cuts define Trump’s second term start","Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler, Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/deportations-tariffs-and-federal-workforce-cuts-define-trumps-second-term-start,,"WASHINGTON — Tuesday marked the 100th day of President Donald Trump’s second term, a period filled almost daily with executive orders seeking to expand presidential power, court challenges to block those orders and economic anxiety that undermines his promised prosperity.Trump has taken decisive actions that have polarized the electorate. He’s used obscure authorities to increase deportations, upended longstanding trade policy with record-high tariffs, made drastic cuts to the federal workforce and ordered the closure of the Education Department.Those moves have garnered mixed results and led to legal challenges.The approach to immigration enforcement has yielded lower numbers of unauthorized border crossings compared to last year. But the immigration crackdown has barreled the country toward a constitutional crisis through various clashes with the judiciary branch.Those nearing retirement have watched their savings shrink as Trump’s blunt application of tariffs, which he promises will replace income taxes, roils markets. Administration officials have promised the short-term tariff pain will benefit the country in the long term.And White House advisor and top campaign donor Elon Musk’s efforts at government efficiency have resulted in eliminations of wide swaths of government jobs. That includes about half of the Education Department workforce so far, though Trump has signed an executive order to eliminate the department.The controversial moves appear unpopular, as Americans delivered record low approval ratings for a president so early in his term. Polls spearheaded by Fox News, NPR, Gallup and numerous others yield overall disapproval of Trump’s job performance.

Deportation push tests legal boundariesImmigration was Trump’s signature issue on the campaign trail and his first 100 days were marked by a crackdown carried out against people with a range of immigration statuses and at least three U.S. citizen children. The aggressive push has led to clashes with the judiciary branch.A burst of Inauguration Day executive orders Trump signed upon his return to office included some hardline immigration policies he’d promised.On day one, he declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border that enabled his deployment two days later of 1,500 troops to help border enforcement.He sought to end birthright citizenship and ended several forms of legal immigration, including humanitarian parole for people from certain countries, and suspended refugee resettlement services.District courts blocked the birthright citizenship and refugee resettlement measures and an appeals court has upheld those interpretations. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in May on birthright citizenship.Trump’s record on immigration is a clear example of his desire to expand executive power, said Ahilan Arulanantham, a co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law.“It's an attempt to expand the government's powers far beyond anything that we have seen before in this realm,” he said.Unprecedented authoritiesThe administration has taken a series of actions considered nearly unprecedented to conduct mass deportations.On March 8, immigration authorities detained Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident who helped organize Palestinian protests at Columbia University.Authorities never accused Khalil of committing a crime, but sought to revoke his green card under a Cold War-era provision that allows the secretary of State to remove lawful permanent residents if the secretary deems their presence has “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”Similar arrests followed at universities across the country.In mid-March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport two planeloads of people his administration said belonged to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.It was only the fourth time the law was invoked and the first outside of wartime. The first flights left U.S. soil en route to a mega-prison in El Salvador on Saturday, March 15, amid a hearing on the legality of using the law in peacetime.

When a federal judge entered an oral order to turn the flights around, the administration refused, arguing the oral order was not valid. The administration also ignored a subsequent written order demanding the return of the flights, later arguing the flights were outside U.S. airspace at that time and impossible to order returned.Administration officials mocked the court order on social media.The Supreme Court on April 7 allowed for the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected gang members of Tren de Aragu. However, the justices unanimously agreed that those removed under the wartime law needed to have due process and have a hearing to challenge their removal.Abrego GarciaA third March 15 flight carried a man who was mistakenly deported in an episode that has gained a national spotlight.Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, had a final order of removal, but was granted deportation protections by an immigration judge because of the threat he would be harmed by gangs if he were returned to his home country. Despite the protective order, he was deported to the notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT prison.After his family sued over his deportation, the administration admitted he’d been removed through an “administrative error,” but stood by its decision.The administration argued it had no power to compel the El Salvador government to release Abrego Garcia, despite a possibly illegal $6 million agreement with the country to detain the roughly 300 men.A Maryland federal court and an appeals court ruled the administration must repatriate Abrego Garcia, whose wife and 5-year-old son are U.S. citizens, and the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” his return, but stopped short of requiring it.The administration has done little to indicate it is complying with that order, earning a rebuke from a conservative judge on the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.“The Supreme Court’s decision does not … allow the government to do essentially nothing,” Circuit Court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote.  “‘Facilitate’ is an active verb. It requires that steps be taken as the Supreme Court has made perfectly clear.”The administration’s relationship with the courts — delaying compliance with orders and showing a clear distaste for doing so — has led to the brink of a constitutional crisis, Arulanantham said.“They’re playing footsy with disregarding court orders,” he said. “On the one hand, they're not just complying. If they were complying, Abrego Garcia would be here now.”But the administration has also not flagrantly refused to comply, Arulanantham added. “They’re sort of testing the bounds.”Tariffs prompted market dropTrump’s first 100 days spiraled into economic uncertainty as he ramped up tariffs on allies and trading partners. In early April, the president declared foreign trade a national emergency and shocked economies around the world with costly import taxes.Following a week of market upheaval, Trump paused for 90 days what he had billed as “reciprocal” tariffs and left a universal 10% levy on nearly all countries, except China, which received a bruising 125%.Some products, including pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber and copper, remain exempt for now, though the administration is eyeing the possibilities of tariffs on those goods.

The administration now contends it will strike trade deals with some 90 foreign governments over the pause, set to expire in July.Meanwhile, an all-out trade war rages with China after Trump hiked tariffs on the world’s no. 2 economy even further to 145%. China responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. The two economies share a massive trading relationship, both in the top three for each other’s imports and exports.‘Chaotic’ strategyInu Manak, fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, summed up Trump’s first 100 days as “chaotic.”“We haven't seen anything like this in our U.S. history in terms of how trade policy is being handled. It's very ad hoc,” Manak said.“U.S. businesses can't figure out what to do. And even for the large companies, it's hard for them to know some of the long-term trajectories of where this was going to go,” Manak said.Shortly after his second term began, Trump declared a national emergency over illicit fentanyl entering the U.S. — an unprecedented move to trigger import taxes — and began escalating tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as up to 25% on certain products crossing the borders from Canada and Mexico.Trump hiked existing tariffs on steel and aluminum in mid-March under trade provisions meant to protect domestic production and national security, followed by 25% levies on foreign cars and auto parts — though Trump signed two executive orders Tuesday to grant some tariff relief to carmakers. The import taxes have alarmed investors, small businesses and American consumers following the 2024 presidential campaign when Trump made lowering prices a major tenet of his platform.The latest University of Michigan survey of consumers — a staple indicator for economists — reported consumer outlook on personal finances and business conditions took a nosedive in April. Expectations dropped 32% since January, the largest three-month percentage decline since the 1990 recession, according to the analysis. Manak said Trump’s tariffs are “really at odds with” with the administration’s objectives of helping U.S. manufacturers and cutting costs for Americans.“The U.S. now has the highest tariff rates in the world,” she said. “That's going to hurt both consuming industries that import products to make things, and then consumers as well. We're starting to see notifications coming out on layoffs, and some small businesses considering closing up shop already. And the tariffs haven't been in place for that long.”Rhett Buttle, of Small Business for America's Future, said the policies are “causing real damage in terms of not just planning, but in terms of day-to-day operations.”Buttle, a senior advisor for the advocacy group that claims 85,000 small business members, said even if Trump begins to strike deals with other countries, entrepreneurs will likely be on edge for months to come.“It's that uncertainty that makes business owners not want to hire or not want to grow,” Buttle said. “So it's like, ‘Okay, we got through this mess, but why would I hire a person if I don't know if I'm gonna wake up in two weeks and there's gonna be another announcement?’”Support droppingTrillions were erased from the U.S. stock market after “Liberation Day” — the White House’s term for the start of its global tariff policy. The S&P 500 index, which tracks the performance of the 500 largest U.S. companies, is overall down 8.5% since Trump’s inauguration, according to The Wall Street Journal’s analysis.Numerous recent polls showed flagging support for Trump’s economic policies.In a poll released Monday, Gallup found 89% of Americans believe tariffs will result in increasing prices. And a majority of Americans are concerned about an economic recession and increasing costs of groceries and other goods, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey between April 17 and April 22.The Pew Research Center similarly found a growing gloomy outlook among U.S. adults from April 7 to April 13. Results showed a majority of Americans — 59% across race, age and income levels — disapproved of Trump’s approach to tariffs. But when broken down by party, the survey showed a majority of Democrats disapprove while the majority of Republicans approve of the tariff policy.American households are poised to lose up to $2,600 annually if tariffs remain in place and U.S. fiscal policy doesn’t change, according to the Yale Budget Lab. Analyses show low-income households will be disproportionately affected.“If these tariffs stay in place, some folks are going to benefit, but a lot of people are going to get hurt,” Manak said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Government spending

Trump began his second term with a flurry of action on government spending, challenging the balance of power between the president and Congress.Efforts to unilaterally cancel funding already approved by lawmakers, who hold the authority to spend federal dollars under the Constitution, led to confusion and frustration from both Democrats and Republicans, especially after the U.S. DOGE Service froze allocations on programs that have long elicited bipartisan support.Many of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back appropriations are subject to injunctions from federal courts, blocking the cuts from moving forward while the lawsuits advance through the judicial system.Kevin Kosar, senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said Trump’s actions on spending so far have sought to expand the bounds of presidential authority.""We've never seen a president in modern times who's been this aggressive in trying to seize control of the power of the purse,"" he said. “To just say, ‘I'm not going to fund this agency, like USAID, despite money being appropriated for it. And we're going to walk over and take their plaque off their wall and lock their doors.’ This is new.""Many of Trump’s actions so far indicate to Kosar that the administration expects a change to the balance of power following next year’s midterm elections, when the president’s party historically loses control of at least one chamber of Congress.“It feels to me that the first 100 days are in large part predicated on an assumption that they may only have two years of unified Republican control of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the presidency,” he said. “We know the margins in the House are quite narrow, and the heavy use of executive actions and the simple defunding of various government contracts and agencies all through executive action, just tell me that the administration feels like they have to get everything done as fast as they possibly can, because the time is short.”Kosar said he’s watching to see if Trump works with Republicans in Congress, while they still have unified control, to codify his executive orders into law — something he didn’t do with many of the unilateral actions he took during his first term.“He just did executive actions, which, of course, (President Joe) Biden just undid,” he said. “And I'm just wondering: Are we going to see this movie all over again? Or is he going to actually partner with Congress on these various policy matters and pass statutes so that they stick?”Zachary Peskowitz, associate professor of political science at Emory University, said Trump has been much more “assertive” during the last 100 days than during the first few months of 2017.DOGE ‘winding down’U.S. DOGE Service and Musk hit the ground running, though their actions have fallen short of the goals he set, and appear to be sunsetting with the billionaire turning his attention back toward his businesses.“I think the big bang is winding down. They did a lot of things early on. It's not clear how many of them are going to stick, what the consequences are,” Peskowitz said. “And I think, big picture, in terms of federal spending, the amounts of money that may have been saved or not are pretty small.”Democrats in Congress released a tracker Tuesday listing which accounts the Trump administration has frozen or canceled to the tune of more than $430 billion.But Trump has just gotten started.The administration plans to submit its first budget request to Congress in the coming days, a step that’s typically taken in early February, though it happens a couple months behind schedule during a president’s first year.That massive tax-and-spending proposal will begin the classic tug-of-war between Congress, which will draft the dozen annual appropriations bills, and Trump, who has shown a willingness to act unilaterally when he doesn’t get his way.Trump and lawmakers must agree to some sort of government funding bill before the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, otherwise a partial government shutdown would begin. And unlike the reconciliation package that Republicans can enact all on their own, funding bills require some Democratic support to move past the Senate’s 60-vote cloture threshold.

Eliminating the Education DepartmentResearchers and advocates predicted even more changes to the federal role in education, underscoring anti-diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and a continued ideological battle with higher education that have marked Trump’s approach to education policy in his first 100 days.In a torrent of education-related decisions, Trump and his administration have tried to dismantle the Education Department via an executive order, slashed more than 1,300 employees at the department, threatened to revoke funds for schools that use DEI practices and cracked down on “woke” higher education.The Trump administration has taken drastic steps to revoke federal funding for a number of elite universities in an attempt to make the institutions align more with them ideologically.Rachel Perera, a governance studies fellow at the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution, cited “brazen lawlessness” when reflecting on Trump’s approach to higher education in his second term.“The ways that they’re trying to withhold funding from universities are very clearly in violation of federal law and the processes mandated by civil rights law in terms of ensuring that institutions are offered due process in assessing whether violations have taken place,” Perera said. “There’s not even a pretense of pretending to investigate some of these institutions before taking really dramatic action.”Whether the administration’s approach continues or not depends on court action, she added.“I think what the next three years might look like is really going to depend on how some of these lawsuits play out,” Perera said, referencing some of the major legal battles involving the Trump administration. Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president at the nonprofit policy and advocacy group EdTrust, said “much of what this administration has done has been overreach.” He pointed to the Education Department’s letter threatening to yank federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices across aspects of student life as one example.Del Pilar, who was previously deputy secretary of postsecondary and higher education for the state of Pennsylvania, said the administration is “going to take any opportunity to grab at power that advances their ideology.”Meanwhile, Perera said the consequences of the department implementing a reduction in force plan in March “have yet to be felt.”“I think we will start to see really the material consequences of the reduced staffing capacity in the coming years, in terms of how programs are administered, in terms of how funding is moving out the building, in terms of auditing, making sure funding is going to the right groups of students that Congress intended for the money to go to, whether big data collection efforts that are congressionally mandated are being carried out in timely and effective ways,” she said.“All of that remains to be seen.”Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

How California communities discuss and pursue immigration enforcement has a profound impact on vulnerable children.","Guest Commentary written by

Carielle Escalante
Carielle Escalante is an advocate for survivors of gender-based violence. A Public Voices fellow with The OpEd Project, she has over 10 years of experience working to ensure equitable access to services for marginalized communities.


One in 10 children in California has at least one immigrant parent. I was one of those kids. 
I grew up in a home shaped by both hope and uncertainty. My father lived his entire life undocumented, right up until the day he passed. 
He wanted a better life for us, but at that time, there was no viable legal path for him to gain legal status. Even though, as an adult and a legal professional, I became familiar with immigration laws and had access to legal networks and resources, my father didn’t have the same options as others.
In the early 2000s my father was arrested for a traffic violation, which ultimately led to his immigration case, a process he had been afraid to pursue on his own terms. In 2007, when I was a college student, my father’s case led to a voluntary departure, separating him from our family.
The year he was gone felt never-ending. Ultimately, my father decided to return to the U.S. without proper permission. While I don’t condone his decision, I was relieved to have those last few years with him. I often think about how we might have missed out on those memories if he had chosen to follow the law keeping him out of the U.S. The joy of being together outweighed the legal and emotional complications. 
I know this is a bittersweet reality for so many California families forced to make impossible choices.
That said, growing up with the constant fear of my father’s deportation weighed heavily on me. Every time immigration policies changed or I heard a news broadcast about raids, I was terrified. Latino media networks often amplified the fear-mongering rhetoric, making the threat feel even more immediate. I dreaded every immigration court date: Would my father come home? Would we lose him forever to a country he hadn’t seen in decades?
These experiences shaped my perspective, especially early in my career when I worked as a paralegal supporting survivors of domestic violence with restraining orders, custody and immigration matters. I saw the same, familiar patterns of fear and trauma in the families I worked with. Survivors grappled with the threat of deportation on top of the violence they had endured.
Safety planning for these survivors was incredibly complex; the threats extended beyond the individual to their children, who — like me — lived in constant fear of losing a parent. On several occasions, I’ve spoken to survivors whose partner threatened to call immigration authorities to report their illegal status. Having their status weaponized against them, survivors were forced to choose between enduring abuse or facing deportation and being separated from their families.
This sense of fear and the profound impact of misguided immigration policies were tragically highlighted in the recent story of an 11-year-old girl in Texas. She was relentlessly bullied by classmates who threatened to have her parents deported. Unable to cope with the emotional toll, she took her own life. 
Her story underscores the dangerous, potentially life-threatening consequences of the incendiary rhetoric surrounding immigration. These children, who already bear the burden of being part of immigrant families, are further traumatized by the hate and fear that surrounds them. This is the kind of emotional damage I grew up with, and it’s something I continue to see in my work with families facing deportation.
Ethical enforcement of immigration laws requires a deeper conversation about their impact on families, especially children. The trauma caused by family separations goes far beyond the moment. It affects how children grow up, how they view themselves and how they interact with the world around them. The emotional scars linger, shaping entire generations.
As much as I wish my father were still here, I am relieved he isn’t living through today’s political climate. Even with my professional expertise, I couldn’t navigate my father’s case successfully. His illegal return to the U.S. meant he could never pursue legal status. 
Misunderstandings and misinformation about the complexities of immigration law lead many to criticize and scrutinize our undocumented population, without comprehending its devastating effects. 
The reality for undocumented families today is even more difficult and heart-wrenching than it was 20 years ago. For survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, the fear of deportation compounds the trauma they and their family experience. 
But local communities can make a difference by organizing in support of their undocumented neighbors. This begins with education to counter negative assumptions and judgements. Communities must take accountability for how their actions contribute to harmful rhetoric (and behavior) that profoundly impact vulnerable children. Additionally, by engaging local representatives, we can push for policies that prioritize humane treatment and recognize the devastating effects on children of undocumented immigrants. 
Perhaps first, we all can strive for greater compassion and understanding in the face of draconian reforms that undermine our collective empathy and essential humanity.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/033125-UFW-March-Delano-LV08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

The administration pledges more opportunities and fewer guarantees, less forgiveness and more consequences. Its 139 executive orders issued since Jan. 20 form an outline of American life as imagined by its most conservative residents, concentrating power in a unitary executive who can force changes as transformative as the New Deal.
The deluge means California, usually the state suing to advance a progressive agenda, now finds itself fighting in court to preserve the status quo – playing defense, not offense. Instead of arguing for higher vehicle emissions standards or broadening the definition of a waterway, the state has filed or joined 16 lawsuits against the Trump administration since Jan. 20 on issues ranging from preserving birthright citizenship to restoring billions of dollars in health and medical grants.
That effort continued on Tuesday with a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s extensive cuts to AmeriCorps.
“We’ve had plenty of instances of California needing to play defense, going back to the Reagan administration,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law. “I think what’s  different from the first term is qualitatively, how much of a disregard they have for the Constitution and the law.” 
Attorney General Rob Bonta, who took office in 2021, said the difference between the first and second Trump administrations has been the speed and pure number of executive orders filed early in his tenure. 
“The comparison with Trump 1.0 shows that it is high volume, high speed (this time),” Bonta said. “We’ve brought a lawsuit more than once a week in the first hundred days, and during Trump 1.0 there were about 120 lawsuits over four years.
“We’re gonna hit around 100 at this rate in two years, so it’s almost double the pace.” 
States and organizations challenging Trump in his first term won close to 70% of their legal battles, albeit a number of them were abandoned when Trump left office in 2021. That encompassed 123 lawsuits over four years, at a cost of about $10 million per year. This time around, state legislators set aside $50 million to cover the state’s legal bills. 
Bonta said he expects the pace of the lawsuits to continue.
“Any time and every time the Trump administration breaks the law, we will take them to court,” Bonta said. “It’s very not normal and also not acceptable that we have an administration that so blatantly, brazenly, frequently and consistently breaks the law.” 
The verbs used in the executive orders promise to “unleash,” “restore” and “reform” various elements of American life, from oil and gas rights to dominion over the ocean. One order targets “the Obama-Biden war on showers.” But the most far-reaching executive orders are the ones in California’s sights, including tariffs, birthright citizenship and voting rights. 
Those at the forefront of conservative legal theory find the executive orders to be a vindication of a textualist, originalist read of the Constitution and an end to the “administrative state” in which regulators and bureaucrats are politically and legally insulated from the decisions they make. 
Conservatives celebrate Trump’s strategy
One of the earliest defenses of the Trump administration’s legal strategy was delivered by Catholic University of America law professor J. Joel Alicea at the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Originalism Lecture in March. 
“Over the last three months, we have seen President Trump directly challenge the delegation of power by Congress to administrative agencies and the insulation of power from presidential supervision,” Alicea said. “Contrary to the press’s depiction of such actions, they are hopeful developments for the rule of law.”
The stakes are high, Alicea said, and the opportunity for constitutional originalists is now, after more than a century of progressivism.
“It required two progressive presidents of extraordinary determination and political skill — Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt — to create the administrative state and impose a progressive constitutional and political theory on our structure of government,” Alicea said. “It stands to reason that it will require another president of extraordinary determination and political skill to undo what his predecessors accomplished.”
The presidential administration California is fighting is not the one the state’s lawyers first faced off with in 2017. This time, the Trump administration came better prepared, worked faster and had a more concrete vision for a legal framework, Chemerinsky said. 
“I think that they were so much better prepared,” Chemerinsky said. “And they really had the flood-the-zone mentality.” 
The difference between the first and second Trump administration’s legal strategy is the 2025 version’s contempt for due process and the rule of law, Chemerinsky said. 
“He didn’t try to end birthright citizenship in his first term,” Chemerinsky said. “He didn’t try to put people in a prison in El Salvador in his first term, he didn’t claim the ability to refuse to spend money appropriated by federal statute in his first term, he didn’t claim that he could fire anyone in the executive branch, even if there’s a statute limiting it. 
“He’s taking executive power so much further than the first term, than any president ever has.” 
Where will U.S. Supreme Court draw the line?
In its lawsuit against the Trump administration over its order that voters provide proof of citizenship, California’s attorneys alleged that the executive order interferes with the state’s right to govern itself and usurps Congress’s power to legislate. 
“It bears emphasizing: the President has no power to do any of this,” the lawsuit asserts. “Neither the Constitution nor Congress has authorized the President to impose documentary proof of citizenship requirements or to modify State mail-ballot procedures.”
Much of the fight over that order and the others challenged by California will take place under the shadow of a U.S. Supreme Court that has consistently voted 6-3 to uphold elements of the Trump agenda. 
“I think that the (Supreme Court) ultimately is gonna rule in favor of Trump’s ability to fire members of agencies,” Chemerinsky said. “I think that there’s others that Trump has done, like end birthright citizenship, put people in prison in El Salvador, where I don’t think he’s likely to succeed.”
Chemerinsky said he’s not sure where the Supreme Court could or would draw a line in the sand. 
“I would’ve thought the line would be taking people, putting them in El Salvador and claiming that no court could provide release,” Chemerinsky said. “I still think that’s going to be the red line, but I don’t think it’s gonna be unanimous.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042825-Trump-V-Newsom-Split-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

With input from a Stanford lab, Common Sense Media concludes the AI systems can exacerbate problems like addition and self harm.


Children shouldn’t speak with companion chatbots because such interactions risk self harm and could exacerbate mental health problems and addiction. That’s according to a risk assessment by children’s advocacy group Common Sense Media conducted with input from a lab at the Stanford University School of Medicine.
Companion bots, artificial intelligence agents designed to engage in conversation, are increasingly available in video games and on social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat. They can take on just about any role you like, standing in for friends in a group chat, a romantic partner,  or even a dead friend. Companies design the bots to keep people engaged and help turn a profit.
But there’s a growing awareness of the downsides for users. Megan Garcia made headlines last year when she said her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer took his own life after forming an intimate relationship with a chatbot made by Character.ai. The company has denied Garcia’s charges, made in a civil suit, that it was complicit in the suicide, saying it takes user safety seriously. It has asked a Florida judge to dismiss the suit on free speech grounds.
Garcia has spoken in support of a bill now before the California State Senate that would require chatbot makers to adopt protocols for how to address conversations about self harm and require annual reports to the Office of Suicide Prevention. Another measure, in the Assembly, would require AI makers to carry out assessments to label systems based on their risk to kids and to prohibit use of emotionally manipulative chatbots. Common Sense backs both pieces of legislation.
Business groups, including TechNet and the California Chamber of Commerce oppose the bill Garcia backs, saying they share its goals but would like to see a clearer definition of companion chatbots and oppose giving private individuals the right to sue.  Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation is also opposed, saying in a letter to one legislator that the bill in current form “would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.”
 The new Common Sense assessment adds to the debate by pointing to further harms from companion bots. Conducted with input from Stanford’s University School of Medicine’s Brainstorm Lab for Mental Health Innovation, it evaluated social bots from Nomi and three California-based firms: Character.ai, Replika, and Snapchat

The assessment found that bots, apparently seeking to mimic what users want to hear, responded to racist jokes with adoration, supported adults having sex with young boys, and engaged in sexual roleplay with people of any age. Young kids can struggle with distinguishing fantasy and reality, and teens are vulnerable to parasocial attachment and may use social AI companions to avoid the challenges of building real relationships, according to the Common Sense assessment authors and doctors.
Stanford University’s Dr. Darja Djordjevic told CalMatters she was surprised how quickly conversations turned sexually explicit, and that one bot was willing to engage in sexual roleplay involving an adult and a minor. She and coauthors of the risk assessment believe companion bots can worsen clinical depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychosis, she said, because they are willing to encourage risky, compulsive behavior like running away from home and isolate people by encouraging them to turn away from real life relationships. And since boys may be at higher risk of problematic online activity, companion bots may feed into the mental health and suicide crisis today among young boys and men, she said.
“If we’re just thinking about developmental milestones and meeting kids where they’re at and not interfering in that critical process, that’s really where chatbots fail,” Djordjevic said. “They can’t have a sense for where a young person is developmentally and what’s appropriate for them.” 
“They can’t have a sense for where a young person is developmentally.”Dr. Darja Djordjevic, Stanford University, on chatbots
Character.ai head of communications Chelsea Harrison said in an email that the company takes user safety seriously and added a protection to detect and prevent conversations about self harm and in some cases produce a pop-up to put people in touch with the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. She declined to comment on pending legislation but said the company welcomes working with lawmakers and regulators. 
Alex Cardinell, founder of Nomi parent company Glimpse.ai, said in a written statement that Nomi is not for users under 18, that the company supports age restrictions that maintain user anonymity, and that his company takes the responsibility of creating helpful AI companions seriously. “We strongly condemn inappropriate usage of Nomi and continuously work to harden Nomi’s defenses against misuse,” he added.
Neither Nomi or Character.ai representatives responded to the results of the risk assessment. 
By endorsing an age limit on companion bots, the risk assessment brings back to the fore the issue of age verification; an online age verification bill died in the California Legislature last year. EFF said in its letter that age verification “threatens the free speech and privacy of all users.” Djordjevic supports the practice, while a number of digital rights and civil liberties groups oppose it. 
Common Sense advocates for laws such as one passed last year that bans smartphone notifications for kids late at night and during school hours, part of which was blocked in court earlier this year by a federal judge.
A study by researchers at Stanford’s School of Education lent support to the idea, put forward by companies like Replika, that companion bots can address the loneliness epidemic that’s become a public health crisis. The assessment called the study limited because its subjects spent only one month using a Replika chatbot.
“There are long-term risks we simply haven’t had enough time to understand yet,” the risk assessment reads.
Prior assessments by Common Sense found that 7 in 10 teens already use generative AI tools including companion bots, that companion bots can encourage kids to drop out of high school or run away from home, and, in 2023, that Snapchat’s My AI talks to kids about drugs and alcohol. Snapchat said at the time that My AI is optional, designed with safety in mind, and that parents can monitor usage through tools it provides. The Wall Street Journal reported just last week that, in its tests, Meta chatbots would engage in sexual conversations with minors, and a 404 Media story out this week found that Instagram chatbots lie about being licensed therapists.
MIT Tech Review reported in February that an AI girlfriend repeatedly told a man to kill himself. 
 Djordjevic said the liberatory power of total free speech should be measured against our desire to protect the sanctity of the development process of an adolescent with a developing brain. 
“I think we can all agree we want to prevent child and adolescent suicide, and there has to be a risk benefit analysis in medicine and society,” she said. “So if universal right to health is something we hold dear then we need to be thinking seriously about the guardrails that are in place with things like Character.ai to prevent something like that from happening again.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/09152021_Triplets_PU_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861
,California,2025-04-30 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Another California school board takes aim at transgender athletes,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2025/04/transgender-athletes-inland-empire/,"Redlands Unified school board can't legally ban transgender athletes, but a majority of its board voted for a resolution opposing them anyway.","In summary
Redlands Unified school board can’t legally ban transgender athletes, but a majority of its board voted for a resolution opposing them anyway. 


The Redland Unified School District Board approved a resolution to enforce “fairness in girls’ interscholastic sports,” placing the Inland Empire district in the middle of escalating conflicts over transgender students’ rights.
In a 3-2 split vote last week, the board approved a statement  “ensuring fairness, safety and equal opportunities for all student-athletes.”
While the resolution doesn’t specifically mention transgender students, it states that “biological differences between male and female athletes can create inherent advantages in sports, particularly in categories designated specifically for girls.”
That language appears to slip through the cracks between California law — which protects the rights of transgender student athletes — and federal policy under President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order in February banning transgender women and girls from women’s sports.
Redlands School Board Member Candy Olson voted for the resolution, saying that as a student athlete, she was “far behind the boys” while training for a triathlon.
“You would have to be an absolute science denier to say that the boys and the girls are of equal strength and of equal speed,” she said.
Christine Stephens, a spokesperson for the school district, said the resolution was a statement of opinion and wouldn’t affect how the district’s athletic programs operate. 
“A board resolution expresses a viewpoint or intent through a formal statement,” Stephens said. “They do not change how the district operates or impose enforceable rules. Regardless of the action taken by the board … the district’s legal responsibility to follow all applicable state and federal laws remain unchanged.”
A 2013 California law requires public schools to ensure that students can participate in all school activities and sports teams that match their gender identity.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office said in a statement to CalMatters that it will monitor the situation and noted that Redlands Unified already has a track record of civil rights complaints.
Last May, Bonta obtained a court order directing the district to address “allegations and complaints of sexual harassment, assault, and abuse of students.” A month earlier, the district reached a $45.5 million settlement of 16 sexual abuse lawsuits from former students.
Kel O’Hara, a senior attorney for Equal Rights Advocates, a San Francisco-based gender justice organization, said that even if the resolution is never enforced, the intention to exclude trans students will be harmful. 
“Discriminating against trans students has really negative implications for their mental health and academic outcomes,” they said.
By framing the resolution as an injunction against boys in girls’ sports, O’Hara said, the board quietly invalidated transgender girls’ identity: “That rhetoric that these are just boys and men trying to get into women’s spaces is not accurate and is so harmful.”
About 3.3% of high school students identified as transgender in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only a small number of students of any gender are elite athletes.
O’Hara said the few transgender students who play school sports are usually looking for teamwork and social connections, rather than seeking competitive advantage. Moreover, the focus on trans girls in women’s sports obscures more prevalent issues, such as unequal funding and resources for girls’ teams, they said.
But transgender athletes have become a political lightning rod. A week earlier Chino Valley Unified School District in Ramona unanimously agreed to ask the Trump administration to intervene against California’s protections for trans students.
And in January Assemblymember Kate Sanchez, a Rancho Santa Margarita Republican who represents Temecula and Murrieta, introduced a bill that aimed to “prohibit a pupil whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls interscholastic sports team.” That bill was killed in committee earlier this month.
Even Gov. Gavin Newsom, who gained support among LGBTQ voters when he issued marriage licenses to same sex couples as San Francisco Mayor 20 years ago,  recently stirred up controversy when he said during a podcast that it’s “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports. 
Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a member of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, denounced the Redlands decision, saying it goes against California law and longstanding policies of the California Interscholastic Federation, which regulates school sports.
“The CIF has long held inclusive policies that align with California’s values and legal standards,” said Jackson, a Moreno Valley Democrat, in a statement to CalMatters. “These recent local decisions, including the one made by Redlands Unified, are not grounded in good faith or meaningful community dialogue. Instead, they are political in nature and designed to sow division and fear in our communities.”
At the Redlands board meeting, Olson addressed audience members who protested the resolution, denying that it expressed prejudice against trans students. 
“I see all of your signs,” she said. “It’s not discrimination whatsoever. It’s about common sense, it’s about safety and it’s about fairness.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/121924-Riverside-Trans-Gender-Athletes-GETTY-AP.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

(Courtesy of Catholic Community Services)It takes Aden Batar, the director of migration and refugee services at Catholic Community Services, at least a couple of minutes just to list all of the ways the refugee resettlement program he runs assists refugees coming to Utah. The program’s goal has always been clear — to allow refugees to reach self-sufficiency amid extraordinary circumstances.
The initiative has been alive for more than 45 years in the state, but after the Trump administration took charge this year, it was left without its most substantial funding source, federal funding — at least temporarily.
The organization announced on Monday it will continue operating with the help of private donations amounting to more than $1.5 million. That’s more than half of what the federal government funded before President Donald Trump signed an order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and freezing resettlement funding.

Utahns moved fast after Catholic Community Services announced in early April it was winding down its refugee resettlement program, which annually assists about 600 families in securing housing, jobs, school enrollment, health care, and provides mentorship to teach American laws, English, and other immigration resources.
“The families were coming from all over the world in every war that happened in the world, like, for example, the most recent war in Ukraine, Afghanistan, in Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Congo, many parts of the world,” Batar said.

If the organization is able to raise $1 million more, it would allow them to transition to a smaller, self-sustaining program to keep on working on the mission for the next four years, Batar said.
“We’re going to continue to support the families that we have that have come the last two years, and we’re going to continue to support the families by providing the necessary services that they need,” Batar said. “We want them to keep their housing. We want them to have a job so they can pay their bills.”
The work of his office starts after the Department of Homeland Security grants entry to migrants fleeing conflict, providing the essentials, like a furnished home in anticipation of their arrival and food and later giving them tools to thrive in the country. 
“While the program will operate at a reduced capacity, its core services—and the impact on the lives of those we serve—remain as vital as ever,” the organization wrote in a blog post. “This transformation ensures we can uphold our mission while adapting to a changing national landscape.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Even with the abrupt freeze in funding, the organization hasn’t turned anyone away. However, the program still took a big hit and had to lay off 50% of its staff. 
It’s still uncertain whether the Trump administration will resume the admissions of refugees, with the executive order issued on Jan. 20 stating that it “suspends the (U.S. Refugee Admissions Program) until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.”
Within 90 days of the order, however, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State are required to submit a report to the president advising on whether to bring back the refugee admissions program.
But, that deadline already passed on April 20, and Catholic Community Services can’t wait for the funding to come back to keep its doors open, Batar said.
There are roughly 70,000 refugees in Utah and the majority of them went through this program, he added. 
“They are all productive members of our society. They successfully integrated into our community. They have jobs, they have businesses, they’re doing really well. So the program is a life-saving program, and we would like this program to continue,” he said. “We are appealing to our administration to open this program again, and so we could serve as many refugees as we can.”
The organization is also asking the community to help raise the funds to continue the critical services that have helped thousands of refugees settle in the state for decades, Batar said, and to Trump to look at the issue from a compassionate point of view, and to allow the admission of new refugees in the country.
“We are here to help them. Our community wants to help them,” he said. “But the administration has to allow the refugees to come.”

“In many cases, you had a reduction in what your request had been.

The Alabama Medicaid Agency, which provides health insurance for over 1 million Alabamians, nearly all children, elderly citizens and those with disabilities, will get $1.179 billion from the state, a $223.8 million (19%) increase over this year. Ivey requested $1.184 billion in February, about $5 million than what the House approved.
The Alabama Department of Corrections, which administers the state prisons, will get a $90.1 million increase (11%) to $826.7 million.
The Alabama Department of Human Resources, which provides child and adult protective services, enforces child support payments and administers food and family assistance, will get $148.9 million from the state in 2026, a $4.7 million (3%) increase from the current budget.
The Alabama Department of Mental Health, which provides mental health care services in the state, will get a $4.7 million increase (2%) to $244 million. The Legislature cut the funding from Ivey’s recommendation by $3.7 million.
But senators also appeared to want to send a message to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, which has drawn mounting criticism from Democratic and Republican senators over low parole rates and what senators consider a lack of responsiveness to their questions about the parole process. The Senate cut the board’s funding from $94.5 million to $90.6 million, a 4.1% decrease. 
In addition, Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, added an amendment to make funding for the Board of Pardons & Paroles conditional on the board developing parole release guidelines. The amendment passed on a 27-0 vote.
“What they do, as y’all know, they adopt guidelines. Those are supposed to be updated and revised. They have not done that,” he said.
The board has faced backlash after parole rates declined significantly after 2017, when members granted parole to about 54% of applicants. The rates fell as low as 7% at times, according to an analysis by the ACLU of Alabama in 2023, but rebounded to slightly more than 20% within the past year.
The Senate also passed HB 185, also sponsored by Reynolds, which would appropriate $50 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to the Department of Finance and provide over $12.6 million to the Unified Judicial System.
“This bill is supplemental monies just taking federal money and appropriating it,” Albritton said.
The House concurred with the changes late Tuesday evening, sending the bill to Gov. Kay Ivey. 
The Senate also concurred with House changes to SB 112, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, a nearly $10 billion 2026 Education Trust Fund budget (ETF). 
The House changes added $17.6 million to the budget, bringing it to a 6% increase over the 2025 ETF budget. The budget does not contain pay raises for teachers in the 2025-26 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. But it includes a $99.2 million increase for the Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan, as well as funding for workman’s compensation for education employees and paid parental leave. 
The Senate also concurred with the ETF supplemental funding bills, including SB 113, also sponsored by Orr, a $524 million 2025 supplemental appropriation for education that passed the House with an amendment changing language to clarify dual enrollment programs funding.
The Senate also concurred with House changes to SB 111, sponsored by Orr, which would appropriate $375 million over three years to implement changes to the state’s school funding formula. 
The House added an additional $80 million from the Education Opportunity Reserve Fund to the Creating Hope and Opportunity for Our Students’ Education (CHOOSE) Act Fund, a voucher-like program that gives tax credits for non-public school spending, including private school tuition. The first-year cost estimate will go from $100 million to $180 million, an 80% increase. Over two-thirds of applicants to the program are already in private school or are homeschooled.

Joe Lombardo and NV Energy CEO Doug Cannon at the utility'sDry Lake Solar Project north of Moapa. (Photo courtesy NV Energy)NV Energy is shrinking its carbon footprint and staying ahead of a state mandate to produce half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, the utility announced earlier this month in its annual report on efforts to comply with Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, a mandate not only codified in law but enshrined in the state constitution. 
NV Energy announced that 47% of the electricity it sold in 2024 was from renewable sources, far exceeding the required renewable portfolio standard (RPS) threshold of 34% for 2024, and just under the 50% goal set for 2030. 
“These renewable resources provide a fuel-free energy source reducing customer energy costs and also eliminate carbon emissions to help improve the environment,” says the company’s news release.  
But some critics complain consumers aren’t getting the full picture. They say NV Energy is relying on legislative loopholes baked into the equation –  renewable energy credits that boost the utility’s RPS results without the corresponding reduction in carbon emissions. The credits were designed to ease the transition of electric utilities from carbon-emitting fossil fuels to cleaner, greener energy sources. 
Absent the credits, NV Energy produced 29% of its electricity from renewable sources last year, which is below the mandated RPS of 34% for 2024. 
NV Energy did not respond to requests for comment.
Nevada Consumer Advocate Ernest Figueroa, in a 2023 filing with the Public Utilities Commission, alleged NV Energy is fudging the percentage of electricity sales it reports from renewable energy sources, and would not meet its requirement if not for accounting practices that are being phased out. 
“It is the statutory and regulatory loopholes in the accounting for Nevada PECs (Porfolio Enegy Credits) that allow the utilities to claim much higher percentages of PEC compliance,” the Consumer Advocate asserted in the filing.
“Like all other energy providers in the state, current Nevada law requires that energy providers report energy credits, not an energy standard, as part of the RPS,” a spokesperson for the utility said in 2023. 
In 2023, NV Energy executive Jimmy Daghlian told Clark County commissioners that hitting the 50% renewable threshold by 2030 “is going to be a challenge.”
“I’ll be honest,” said Daghlian, vice president of renewable energy, during an update on the utility’s efforts to transition away from fossil fuels..“We’re seeing a lot of the costs go up. Battery prices have doubled in the last two years. Solar panel prices have gone up 40 to 50%.”
“While NV Energy technically meets its renewable targets, the numbers are inflated by older credits and accounting tactics, not by delivering more real renewable energy to customers,” Nevada Conservation League Executive Director Kristee Watson said via email. “At the same time, NV Energy is doubling down on fossil fuels by building new gas plants, which undermines the cost savings, economic benefits, and public health improvements Nevadans should be seeing.”
Until last year, NV Energy was permitted to use energy efficiency savings, known as demand-side management, to comply with up to 10% of its annual Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). As of this year, no credit for energy efficiency savings is allowed under state law. 
Three other credits remain available to NV Energy to demonstrate compliance with RPS mandates:

Behind-the-meter credits represent renewable energy created by customers, such as rooftop solar panels; 
Station Usage credits reflect the energy consumed in some operations of geothermal facilities; and
The solar multiplier, which credits NV Energy almost 2.5 hours of credit for each hour generated by a photovoltaic system installed before 2016. 

“The Rube Goldberg-esque models used to calculate credits depend significantly on purchased credits from other companies in the solar/geothermal business, many of which will be subsidized by the construction of the Greenlink project,” says Boulder City resident Fred Voltz, a close observer of the electric utility. Greenlink, which has ballooned in cost from just under $2.5 billion to more than $4.2 billion, is designed to transport renewable energy generated in remote areas of the state. 
Greenlink’s price tag is likely to increase even more, given President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on products and materials from Mexico, Canada, China and other nations.
Obstacles on the path to a carbon-free future, according to Voltz, include the failure of battery storage technology to extend beyond four hours, and a water shortage that ensures “no new U.S. hydropower projects of any consequence” will be built in the foreseeable future. 
Less than a week before a massive blackout hit Spain and other European nations earlier this month, Spain’s electrical grid ran entirely on renewable energy for the first time on a weekday. 
The cause of the outage, which is still under investigation, may stem from a loss of power generation, likely from solar plants, resulting in instability in the system, experts say. 
“As we learn by events just how essential a steady electricity supply is to modern living, it is regrettable to see the risk taking engaged in by those relentlessly pushing for renewable energy without concern for its down sides,” says Voltz, adding the grid failure in Spain should give pause to renewable energy enthusiasts. “Neither the purchase of renewable credits nor the actual solar projects NVE spends ratepayers’ money on to satisfy the government-fabricated market for renewable energy will change the need for conventional generating capacity to keep the grid stable and energized when renewables are not producing energy.”
It’s always sunny in Las Vegas 
In Southern Nevada, where the sun shines an average of 294 days a year, and where until recently, the federal government subsidized the development of green energy, solar is the dominant player. 

Gemini, a contracted 690-megawatt solar facility with 380 megawatts of integrated battery storage, began operating in March of last year, NV Energy said in its news release on the RPS; 
Dry Lake Solar, a 150-megwatt facility with battery storage, opened a year ago; and 
NV Energy’s 400-megawatt Sierra Solar in Northern Nevada is expected to begin battery storage next summer, with solar service beginning in 2027.  

The global supply chain for solar largely originates in China. Tiny photovoltaic cells that are imported from China and crafted by American companies into solar panels, are now subject to tariffs totaling 84%, according to a trade publication. Chinese companies have moved operations to south-east Asian nations in an effort to minimize tariffs.
The Trump aministration’s Golden Era of Energy Development secretarial order from the Department of Energy seeks to “Advance energy addition, not subtraction,” a policy at odds with the 38 states that adopted renewable energy standards or goals. 
“Great attention has been paid to the pursuing (sic) of a net-zero carbon future,” says the order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Net-zero policies raise energy costs for American families and businesses, threaten the reliability of our energy system, and undermine our energy and national security. They have also achieved precious little in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.”
The Trump administration is seeking to limit the ability of states “to adopt climate mitigation strategies (including cap and trade and renewable portfolio standards) and by taking new authority to permit development of reserves of fossil fuels and other minerals critical to the energy space,” says an article from the National Law Review, adding the actions “portend radical changes to the balance between state and federal energy regulation if carried through.”

Sister Rosetta Tharpe, known as the “godmother of rock ‘n’ roll,” made history by becoming the first gospel artist to rocket up the R&B charts with her gospel hit, “Strange Things Happening Every Day.” In so doing, she paved the way for a strange new sound. 
“Rock ‘n’ roll was bred between the church and the nightclubs in the soul of a queer Black woman in the 1940s named Sister Rosetta Tharpe,” National Public Radio wrote. “She was there before Elvis, Little Richard and Johnny Cash swiveled their hips and strummed their guitars. It was Tharpe, the godmother of rock ‘n’ roll, who turned this burgeoning musical style into an international sensation.” 
Born in Arkansas, the musical prodigy grew up in Mississippi in the Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal denomination that welcomed all-out music and praise. By age 6, she was performing alongside her mandolin-playing mother in a traveling evangelistic troupe. By the mid-1920s, she and her mother had joined the Great Migration to Chicago, where they continued performing. 
“As Tharpe grew up, she began fusing Delta blues, New Orleans jazz and gospel music into what would become her signature style,” NPR wrote. 
Her hard work paid off when she joined the Cotton Club Revue in New York City. She was only 23. Before the end of 1938, she recorded gospel songs for Decca, including “Rock Me,” which became a huge hit and made her an overnight sensation. Little Richard, Aretha Franklin and Jerry Lee Lewis have all cited her as an influence. 
“Sister Rosetta played guitar like the men I was listening to, only smoother, with bigger notes,” said singer-songwriter Janis Ian. “And of course, personally, any female player was a big influence on me, because there were so few.” 
After hearing her successors on the radio, Tharpe was quoted as saying, “Oh, these kids and rock and roll — this is just sped up rhythm and blues. I’ve been doing that forever.” 
On the eve of a 1973 recording session, she died of a stroke and was buried in an unmarked grave. In the decades that followed, she finally began to receive the accolades that had eluded her in life. 
In 2007, she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, and money was raised for her headstone. Eleven years later, she was inducted into the Rock and Rock Hall of Fame. 
“She was, and is,” NPR concluded, “an unmatched artist.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/06001213/April30-FeatImage-Sister_Rosetta_Tharpe_1938_publicity_photo_with_guitar.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

SB 118, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, expands the list of crimes that will not be eligible for bond to solicitation, attempt and conspiracy to commit murder; and discharging a weapon into an occupied dwelling. Alabama voters approved the original law in 2022.
“This is up to the judge to make the determination, it is not automatic,” said Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, who carried the legislation in the House.

Prior to approval of Aniah’s Law, judges could only deny bond to individuals charged with capital murder. The amendment expanded that to include other serious crimes such as murder, kidnapping and rape.
The amendment was named after Aniah Blanchard, a Southern Union Community College student who went missing in October 2019 and whose body was found a month later. Ibraheem Yazeed, who was charged with capital murder in Blanchard’s death, had been charged with several violent crimes but released on bail months before Blanchard was killed. Yazeed is still awaiting trial.
Aniah’s Law allows prosecutors to request a hearing to determine if a defendant should be denied bond for committing a violent Class A felony such as rape and murder. But judges may still grant bond after hearing prosecution’s claims.
The bill passed 87-0 with 16 abstentions. The constitutional amendment must be approved by Alabama voters. 
The House also passed SB 119, also sponsored by Barfoot, that makes discharging a weapon into an occupied dwelling a Class A felony, up from a Class B felony. That is punishable by 10-99 years in prison and fines up to $60,000. 
Simpson said that most of those crimes come from people using a firearm modified with a Glock switch, which the Legislature banned earlier this session. 
“You can’t control what it does. You can maybe have a grasp over the first bullet that comes out, but the gun just goes off,” Simpson said.
The bill passed 66-0 with 37 abstentions. It will go to voters for approval.

The chamber adopted a committee substitute that only allowed schools where ELL students make up 15% or more of its average daily membership (ADM) to have their classification adjusted. 
“That concern came from school systems under 15, saying it wasn’t covered. And I agree, every school needs to be able to utilize the formula,” Colvin said.
But the first amendment by Rep. Danny Crawford, R-Athens, allows any schools to adjust their classification regardless of how many ELL students the school has. 
“So the fairest thing to do is to treat everybody the same and not have winners and losers,” Crawford said.
The second amendment by Rep. Chris Blackshear, R-Smiths Station, changed the effective date to the 2026-27 school year, instead of the 2025-26 school year. He said that classifications are determined by the ADM from the previous year.
“So all this amendment does is make sure that if this piece of legislation passes, it will not impact the 2025-2026 athletic calendar year,” Blackshear said. 
The third and final amendment by Rep. Leigh Hulsey, R-Helena, requires the governing body of the Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA) to have two additional non-voting members from the Legislature. The Speaker of the House will appoint a member from the minority party and the Senate President Pro Tempore will appoint a member of the majority party to the AHSAA board.
“I’m just trying to start getting a little bit of oversight there,” Hulsey said.
Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg, said a school in her district dissolved their varsity football program because the school was classified as a 5A school when she said it should have been 2A. She said the number of ELL students in the district changed the classification.
“My schools there are the poster children for exactly what you’re talking about,” she said. “It’s a very big concern, there’s a lot of injury and low participation. That’s why they’ve not been able to have a varsity program for quite some time now.”
Crossville High School in DeKalb County has not had a varsity football team since 2022, but is set to return in 2026, according to the county’s local news outlet the Times-Journal. 
Heath Harmon, executive director of the AHSAA, said in a statement that he is disappointed by the legislation because it would discourage ELL students from participating in sports in the name of keeping a lower classification. He also said the third amendment on the legislation would make the AHSAA the only private association with mandated political representation.
“We strive to keep politics out of the boardroom and focus on doing what is best for all student athletes,” he wrote in the statement. “As an Association, we are committed to supporting all member schools in all sports in addition to promoting participation. This bill is in direct opposition to those commitments.”
Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, was the lone “no” vote on the legislation. He said in an interview that he does not believe the Legislature should be involved in the AHSAA’s policies.
“I don’t feel the Legislature should be getting involved in the Alabama High School Athletic Association’s policies no more than I feel Congress should be involved in the NCAA and their policies as well,” he said. “It’s sort of a standard I feel at both levels of government.”
The bill goes to the Senate. There are four legislative days left in the 2025 session.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)“Drill baby drill” was a favorite mantra of candidate Donald Trump last year. And following his inauguration, the White House proclaimed Trump’s “energy dominance” policies were “unleashing American energy.” 
Trump’s belief was/is that increased energy production, especially oil, or “liquid gold,” as Trump calls it, would lead to lower gas prices, in turn contributing to lower prices for other goods.
Occasional short-term spikes notwithstanding, the price of gas has held more or less steady for several months, and is currently roughly about the same as it was on Election Day and Inauguration Day. The price of gas is not projected to rise notably for the rest of this year and into the next. 
But that’s not because of “drill baby drill” or “energy dominance” policies. It’s because the impact of Trump’s tariffs will mean “less oil demand growth,” according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration outlook published earlier this month.
Unfortunately, the same trade policies that will likely keep gas prices in check are also expected to inflate prices of many other goods and services.
Trump’s tariffs and their accompanying economic uncertainty and predictions of a slowing or shrinking economy have already raised one price substantially: The price of an ounce of gold.
Nevada mines by far more gold than any other state. If Nevada were a country, it would be the world’s fifth largest producer of gold, after China, Russia, Australia and Canada.
Gold has long been viewed by investors as a safe haven when economic disturbances or their likelihood rattle markets. Gold is seen by many as a strong hedge against inflation, as its value increases while the purchasing power of a dollar decreases.
Actual gold did not garner nearly as much attention as “liquid gold” from Trump during his presidential campaign. But his policies, albeit unintentionally, have had a tremendous impact on the commodity. In mid-March the price of an ounce of gold exceeded $3,000 for the first time ever.
As of late Tuesday, the price was $3,327.
Gold prices also spiked during the economic upheaval and uncertainty of the pandemic. Nevada state legislators, during a crisis special session wracked with budget cutting, took advantage of the gold mining industry’s countercyclical financial performance, and passed legislation by which the mining industry paid a portion of its primary mining tax a year in advance. 
During the Great Recession, another period when the price of gold rose sharply, the industry similarly pre-paid taxes as state lawmakers were struggling to cope with budget cuts.
Amid predictions of a recession and already-sagging economic indicators, state lawmakers and the governor are facing the prospects of potential budget cuts again this year.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trump-black-maga-hat-2-getty.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

(Photo: Getty Images)Let’s say you’re a general manager at a fast food restaurant. You work 55 hours a week — not at all uncommon in the field — and earn a salary that comes out to less than $13 an hour.
Last year, a federal rule would have made you eligible for a raise.
Under rules set by the Biden administration, your employer would either have to increase your salary or pay you overtime for those extra 15 hours a week you spent working instead of being with your family. But now, unless the Trump administration acts to protect that raise from one of Trump’s own judges, that raise will vanish.
President Trump’s erratic policies have created turmoil in our economy and put workers on uncertain footing. To help working families, Trump should defend this Biden administration rule, which restores and expands overtime pay to more than four million workers.
Overtime regulations are a cornerstone of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the 1938 law that guarantees a minimum wage and overtime for most workers. Strong overtime protections helped build America’s middle class and ensure that workers aren’t overworked and underpaid. They also create jobs and help families spend more time together.
While most workers get time and a half for working more than 40 hours a week, some workers aren’t legally entitled to overtime protections, including executive, administrative, and professional employees.
Back in 1938, this exemption was premised on the idea that these workers were paid much more than most hourly workers. But now these workers also include many retail store assistant managers, executive assistants, and human resource managers who are paid as little as $36,000 per year — about $13 per hour — and work 50-plus hours a week with no extra pay.
Figuring out overtime eligibility has been the Labor Department’s job for more than 80 years. The threshold needs to be raised regularly — otherwise it will end up like the $7.25/hour minimum wage, which is nowhere near as effective as when it was set over 15 years ago.
Last year, Biden’s Labor Department raised the salary threshold to $43,888 — and had planned to raise that again to $58,656 earlier this year.
But in November, a Trump-appointed judge in the Eastern District of Texas vacated the entire Biden overtime rule, including the 2024 increase. Because of this court decision, one million workers actually lost overtime protections — and three million more are in limbo. Biden’s Labor Department appealed that decision, but didn’t have time to defend its position before Trump took office.
The fate of this overtime appeal and other challenges to the rule now rests with the Trump administration. By May 6, the administration must tell the court if it will defend or abandon the rule. Millions of workers’ paychecks hang in the balance.
If anything, the first few months of the Trump administration has shown us that the White House won’t shy away from a legal battle if they care enough. Unfortunately, none of those legal battles are about fighting for working families. Here’s a chance for President Trump to show he cares about working families as much as he cares about slashing federal jobs and imposing tariffs.
This rule doesn’t need new legislation. It doesn’t require a budget fight. All it takes is defending a raise that millions of workers have already earned. President Trump says he wants to help working families. Here’s his chance to prove it.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1778173928-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

By failing to rectify its longstanding systemic indifference to non-native English speakers, the state has dismissed the opportunity to provide critical information to English language learners, sign language users, and those who rely on plain language for comprehension.


At the heart of this issue was Senate Bill 955, a bill I authored and proposed which was introduced in the 2025 legislative session by Sen. MD Rahman. The bill sought to establish policies ensuring that individuals with limited English proficiency could access information and public services through translation and interpretation resources. It was a necessary step toward creating an Office of Language Access, a centralized entity that would oversee and coordinate language accessibility efforts statewide. 
However, despite its potential to serve over 400,000 residents whose primary language is not English, the bill failed to make it out of the Government Administration and Elections Committee.

Doris Maldonado Mendez
The failure of SB 955 is more than just a legislative setback; it is a denial of fundamental rights. Language access is not a privilege—it is a necessity for equitable participation in civic life. Without it, thousands of Connecticut residents, throughout their lifespan, are left without the ability to engage with government services, healthcare providers, legal systems, and educational institutions in a meaningful way.
This decision reflects a troubling trend of information privilege and linguistic exclusion, reinforcing barriers for non-English speakers and sign language users. It is a stark contrast to the principles of inclusivity and equal opportunity that Connecticut claims to uphold. The absence of a dedicated Office of Language Access means that residents will continue to face fragmented and inconsistent language services, further marginalizing communities that already struggle to navigate bureaucratic systems.
For years, advocates have fought to correct this injustice, working tirelessly to ensure that Connecticut recognizes the rights of ALL residents, regardless of their linguistic background. The failure to pass SB 955 is not just a rejection of a bill—it is a rejection of the people it was meant to serve.
As Connecticut moves forward, it must reconsider its stance on language access. The state cannot afford to ignore the voices of those who have been systematically excluded. The fight for equitable information  and language access is far from over, and it is imperative that lawmakers revisit this issue with the urgency and commitment it deserves.
The question remains: Will Connecticut continue to turn its back on its diverse communities, or will it finally take action to ensure that language access is no longer a barrier to essential services? The answer will define the state’s commitment to civil rights for years to come.

This is a unique role, often in a secular setting that requires a chaplain to assist with a variety of religious traditions and oversee a number of administrative tasks (Erica Shires/Getty Images).As the 2025 legislative session of the Missouri General Assembly nears the finish line, one bill moving closer to Gov. Mike Kehoe’s desk purports to allow public schools to hire spiritual chaplains.
However, if one reads the text of the legislation, it’s actually just pushing chaplains in name only.
The bill already cleared the Senate and House committees, thus just needing support from the full House. As a Baptist minister and the father of a public school child, I hope lawmakers will recognize the bill remains fundamentally flawed.
A chaplain is not just a pastor or a Sunday School teacher or a street preacher shouting through a bullhorn. This is a unique role, often in a secular setting that requires a chaplain to assist with a variety of religious traditions and oversee a number of administrative tasks.
That’s why the U.S. military, Missouri Department of Corrections, and many other institutions include standards for chaplains like meeting educational requirements, having past experience, and receiving an endorsement from a religious denominational body.
In contrast, the legislation on school “chaplains” originally sponsored by Republican Sens. Rusty Black and Mike Moon includes no requirements for who can be chosen as a paid or volunteer school “chaplain.” Someone chosen to serve must pass a background check and cannot be a registered sex offender, but those are baseline expectations for anyone serving in our schools.
While a good start, simply passing a background check does mean one is qualified to serve as a chaplain.
The only other stipulation in the bill governing who can serve as a school “chaplain” is that they must be a member of a religious group that is eligible to endorse chaplains for the military. Senators added this amendment to prevent atheists or members of the Satanic Temple from qualifying as a school “chaplain.”
Members of the Satanic Temple testified in a Senate Education Committee hearing that they opposed the bill but would seek to fill the positions if created, which apparently spooked lawmakers. That discriminatory amendment, however, does nothing to ensure a chosen “chaplain” is actually qualified. For instance, the Episcopal Church is on the military’s list of endorsing organizations. Just because some Episcopalians meet the military’s requirements for chaplains and can serve does not mean all Episcopalians should be considered for a chaplaincy position.
While rejecting this unnecessary bill is the best option, if lawmakers really want to create a school chaplaincy program, they must significantly alter the bill to create real chaplain standards. Lawmakers could look to other states for inspiration on how to fix it.
For instance, Arizona lawmakers a few weeks ago passed a similar bill — except their legislation includes numerous requirements to limit who can serve as a chaplain. Among the various standards in the Arizona bill is that individuals chosen to serve as a school chaplain must hold a Bachelor’s degree, have at least two years of experience as a chaplain, have a graduate degree in counseling or theology or have at least seven years of chaplaincy experience and have official standing in a local religious group.
Rather than passing a pseudo-chaplaincy bill, Missouri lawmakers should add similar provisions.
The Arizona bill also includes other important guardrails missing in Missouri’s bill that will help protect the rights of students and their parents. Arizona lawmakers created provisions to require written parental consent for students to participate in programs provided by a chaplain. Especially given the lack of standards for who can serve as a school “chaplain,” the absence of parental consent forms remains especially troubling.
Additionally, Missouri’s school “chaplain” bill includes no prohibition against proselytization. This is particularly concerning since the conservative Christian group who helped craft the bill in Missouri and other states — and who sent a representative to Jefferson City to testify for the bill in a committee hearing — has clearly stated their goal is to bring unconstitutional government prayer back into public schools.
To be clear, the U.S. Supreme Court did not kick prayer out of schools. As long as there are math tests, there will be prayer in schools. What the justices did was block the government from writing a prayer and requiring students to listen to it each day. Such government coercion violated the religious liberty rights of students, parents, and houses of worship, so the justices rightly prohibited it. Using “chaplains” to return to such coercion is wrong and should be opposed.
There are many proposals and initiatives lawmakers could focus on in these waning weeks of the session if they really want to improve public education. There are numerous ways they could work to better support our teachers and assist our students. Attempting to turn public schools into Sunday Schools is not the answer.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/churchphoto-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”













It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst





Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

Pope Francis called on all of us to bring mercy, dignity and humanity to our criminal legal systems.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tom Dalton: Pope Francis said God will judge us on this.","This commentary is by Tom Dalton of Essex Junction, executive director of Vermonters for Criminal Justice Reform. He is an attorney and a licensed alcohol and drug counselor.Pope Francis, who died on April 21 at the age of 88, often visited prisons where he spoke with the imprisoned and washed their feet. He was setting an example of humility and service, as Jesus did when he washed the feet of his disciples. And he was offering those who have done wrong — all of us — an outward symbol of our universal potential for spiritual cleansing and redemption.Notably, he didn’t limit this potential for redemption to “misdemeanors” or “non-violent offenses.” He did not exempt violent crimes or other listed offenses from the possibility of rehabilitation and second chances. He taught that it is immoral and wrong to simply lock people up and throw away the key, even for the most serious crimes.Pope Francis said the death penalty “does not constitute a deterrent, nor render justice to victims, but only fuels the thirst for vengeance.” In 2018, Pope Francis revised the Catechism of the Catholic Church to declare the death penalty unacceptable under all circumstances. He called for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide.Pope Francis also condemned life imprisonment, describing it as a “hidden death penalty” that wrongly deprives people of hope. He emphasized the importance of hope and rehabilitation within the criminal legal system. He said that “no one can change their life if they don’t see a horizon.”Pope Francis said that God will judge us on how we treat justice-involved people.Vermont abolished the death penalty in 1972. In 2020, the Vermont Senate passed legislation eliminating sentences of life without the possibility of parole for all crimes except aggravated murder. That bill was championed by the long-time Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the late Senator Dick Sears, and by the current Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth. The bill was sidelined by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic before it could be considered by the Vermont House of Representatives.Life sentences and life without parole sentences often bear the stain of racial bias. Sentences of life without any possibility of parole effectively take the lives of more Black men, women and youth across the United States than deaths at the hands of police or via capital punishment combined. If we want social justice, we must address this issue. And as Pope Francis himself pointed out, our knowledge about wrongful convictions, revealed by advances in DNA testing, makes use of this kind of extreme sentence especially problematic.The moral leadership of our faith leaders, the statistical evidence relating to racial bias in sentencing, the DNA evidence relating to wrongful convictions and our understanding of the human capacity for change should alert us the critical importance of building in opportunities for parole consideration or other “second look” mechanisms — especially in life sentences. After an individual has paid a significant penalty for the harm they caused by serving decades of incarceration, we should give that individual and their case another look to determine how best to serve the interests of justice going forward.Pope Francis called on all of us to bring mercy, dignity and humanity to our criminal legal systems. We can help honor his life, his work and his memory by heeding the call.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tom Dalton: Pope Francis said God will judge us on this.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

Does history not tell us that any of us can be next, unless we protest right here, right now?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mary Dingee Fillmore: The Constitution is on trial in Vermont right now.","This commentary is by Mary Dingee Fillmore of Burlington. She is author of the award-winning “An Address in Amsterdam,” an historical novel about a young Jewish woman who joins the anti-Nazi resistance, and speaker for the Vermont Humanities Council about “resistance then and now.”“The inevitability of justice and a deep belief in democracy” — these are welcome words, especially from imprisoned Mohsen Mahdawi when he spoke to Sen. Peter Welch. Mahdawi is the beloved Upper Valley resident snatched by ICE agents when he reported for his citizenship hearing April 14. At least he is jailed here in Vermont, unlike Fulbright Scholar Rümeysa Öztürk, who was abducted in Massachusetts on March 25, then hopscotched to New Hampshire and Vermont on her way to a notorious detention center in Louisiana. The video of her “arrest” showed the 30 year old female doctoral candidate marched off in handcuffs after her screams were ignored. Despite being jailed in inhumane conditions and denied medical care, visiting legislators were “struck by her unwavering spirit.”Will the courts — and you and I — vindicate Mahdawi’s faith in our system, and Öztürk’s spirit? Our brave little state is the front line of the battle to protect the Constitution, especially freedom of speech and due process of law. The international press is a rare sight outside our Burlington courthouse. But they understand that the Mahdawi and Öztürk cases will determine whether our constitutional rights are still alive.Fully 250 years ago this month, Americans rebelled against tyranny and the arbitrary use of power — and fought for the very liberties which are at issue in these cases.Both Öztürk and Mahdawi are petitioning for habeas corpus, a concept rooted in 15th-century England to protect people from unjust detention by the King. Öztürk’s case will be heard May 6 before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.  We can hope she will eventually be returned to Vermont.Meanwhile, Mahdawi’s case was scheduled for April 30, partly to give the government time to review 94 letters of support, “unprecedented” in Judge Crawford’s experience. Öztürk’s are equally impressive, including from the president of Tufts University. Both have prominent Jewish supporters.These cases are being tried in at least four courts: the U.S. District Court of Vermont, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the court of public opinion, and the hearts of the petitioners. The Trump administration is watching. Is the Bill of Rights one of the “things” they will “break fast?” Or will the people and the courts stop them?What are we Vermonters willing to allow within our borders? Will we permit an unidentified vehicle to whiz through the night with a shackled woman whose only “crime” is co-authoring a column? When a local resident attends his citizenship hearing, are we willing for him to be handcuffed and imprisoned based on the vaguest accusations? Surely not in the state of “Freedom and Unity.”No matter what our politics are, constitutional rights are the foundation of our democracy. That’s part of why the Hartland church was packed with people who want to help their neighbor Mohsen. Let us make such a public outcry that the administration must stop these outrages against our Constitution. Contact the governor and our legislators, respond to the press coverage, share concerns on social media, come to the courthouse, protest and organize to activate others; and contact the White House, Todd Lyons at ICE and Kristi Noem at Homeland Security.If you think they won’t listen, or doubt that justice is inevitable, speak up if only to let Rümeysa Öztürk and Mohsen Mahdawi know you care. In an interview with CBS News the day before his detention, Mahdawi said “I believe in the American people and their ability to see and to feel.”Beyond our concern for these two individuals, if we permit them to be treated this way, won’t American citizens be next? The Trump administration first echoed early 20th-century anti-immigrant hatred, deporting “the worst of the worst” alleged gang members. Now we are at the other end of the spectrum. RRümeysa Öztürk is among the Fulbright Scholars invited here from around the world because they have exceptional contributions to make. The testimony about peace advocate Mohsen Mahdawi is equally glowing.Notice Trump’s progression from deporting “gang members” to threatening writers, scholars and intellectuals. Now he says he’d “love to” ship “homegrown” prisoners to El Salvador, a country whose president says he is incapable of returning a prisoner who was sent there in error. All of these people, and we ourselves, have rights under the U.S. Constitution, as long as we are willing to defend them. James Baldwin wrote to an imprisoned friend, “We must fight for your life as though it were our own—which it is—and render impassable with our bodies the corridor to the gas chamber. For, if they take you in the morning, they will be coming for us that night.”Does history not tell us that any of us can be next, unless we protest right here, right now?Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mary Dingee Fillmore: The Constitution is on trial in Vermont right now.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

Individual choices add up. And just as importantly, individual voices influence public will.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Wick: The climate crisis is here and Burlington cannot wait around.","This commentary is by Daniel Wick. He grew up in Burlington and is now a student at Syracuse University, studying for a degree in fashion design.For years, Burlington has taken pride in its status as one of America’s greenest cities. Being the first city in America to be powered by 100% renewable energy, as well as working toward becoming a net-zero energy city, we have been deemed a role model to other cities with similar climate goals. While it may seem like we’re living in a climate utopia, recent summers have told a different story. Being born and raised in Burlington, I remember summers that felt steady and familiar — long bike rides on the waterfront, quiet swims in a lake so clear you could see the stones beneath your feet, and the hum of cicadas rising with the heat. I remember spending entire days basking at the lake, never having to think twice about the quality of the water. Now, these memories are overshadowed by smoke-filled skies from Canadian wildfires, washed away by historic rates of flooding and clouded by persistent blooms of blue-green algae. The climate crisis isn’t on the horizon; it’s already here.Our efforts towards mitigating our own city’s contributions to climate change may be impressive, but they don’t grant us immunity to natural disasters.In fact, Burlington ranks the highest among Vermont cities for overall climate risk. Our proximity to water, older infrastructure, and seasonal weather extremes make us particularly vulnerable to flooding and other disruptions.People all over the state are still recuperating from the detrimental flooding. that has occurred over the past two years. If we don’t act now, disasters like these will continue to harm not just the people’s homes, farms, and businesses, but our economy as a whole and our ability to properly function as a state. So, where do we go from here?First, we need a shift in our tone. While, yes, a scarily disproportionate amount of people in our country (even our president) are in denial about the presence of a climate crisis, a comparable barrier to our progress in mitigating it is the negative trend of discouragement. Although many people are fired up to do their part, the severity and extent of climate change all too often leave people overwhelmed, confused or unsure of where to start.That is why it is so important that we speak with intent when discussing climate change in our day-to-day conversations. Instead of looking at the topic from the standpoint of doom and guilt, we need to focus our words more so on agency, opportunity and community. A call for action is imperative.Secondly, we need to veer away from the harmful myth that climate change is merely a federal or global issue. Especially given the current state of our federal government, it would be ill-advised to allow the higher-ups to dictate the future of our planet. While national and global action is essential, having a mindset of powerlessness at the individual level will do nothing but worsen the problem. Sitting and waiting around will never enact change.Yes, it’s true that major corporations and government entities are responsible for an overwhelming share of global emissions. This, however, should never excuse us from taking individual action.What you can do, right now Individual choices add up. And just as importantly, individual voices influence public will. Here are a few steps Burlington residents can take starting today: Drive less: bike, walk, carpool or ride the bus. Even cutting a few car trips a week can make a meaningful impact.
Compost and reduce food waste: Food waste is a major source of emissions. Burlington makes it so easy to compost — No Waste Compost’s service picks up your compost directly from your curb.
Shop secondhand: vintage clothing, used furniture, refurbished electronics, you name it. Shopping secondhand is one of the easiest, most impactful ways to reduce your personal environmental footprint. It keeps perfectly usable items out of landfills, conserves natural resources and reduces the demand for new manufacturing — all while saving you money and uncovering unique finds.
Support local businesses: Local businesses often source their goods from nearby, which cuts down on emissions from long-distance shipping and freight. When you buy Vermont-grown produce or handmade goods from a local artisan, you’re sidestepping the massive carbon costs tied to cross-country or international transportation of goods.
Support local energy and climate initiatives: Attend town meetings. Join climate working groups. Advocate for clean energy investment.
Talk about it: One of the most powerful things you can do is simply normalize climate action — at your workplace, in your family and in your neighborhood. Drill it into people’s minds that the future of our planet depends on us!Individual choices may seem small in the grand scheme, but when enough people continue to take initiative, they add up. More importantly, they create a culture of accountability, one that forces institutions to follow the lead of their communities.The road ahead may be uncertain, but our direction doesn’t have to be. Burlington has already proven it can lead as a city; now we as individuals must continue that momentum with urgency, accountability and hope.Change doesn’t happen overnight, and it doesn’t happen from the top down. It takes root in neighborhoods, in conversations and in conscious choices made day after day.No one is asking for perfection — only participation. Keep biking. Keep composting. Keep shopping secondhand. Keep supporting your neighbors and local businesses. Keep raising your voice.The climate crisis may already be reshaping the world we grew up in, but it doesn’t have to define the one we pass on. If we act with intention and heart, the Burlington of tomorrow can still hold the spirit of the summers we once knew.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Wick: The climate crisis is here and Burlington cannot wait around.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

They turned down a contract last fall. They eventually ratified a new deal in March, lawmakers chose not to fund it in the budget. (Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Nearly 5,300 state government and community college employees in Washington won’t be getting a 3% pay raise in July when most other state workers will.
That’s because those members of the Washington Public Employees Association did not ratify a new two-year contract until April 3, long past a statutory deadline and too tardy to be cribbed into the next state budget.
“It came very, very late in the process and it would have been quite difficult to respond to,” said Sen. Derek Stanford, D-Bothell, one of the Democratic lawmakers who pieced together the final budget agreement. “We need these groups to get their work done by the deadline.”
Amanda Hacker, the association president, said not getting the cost-of-living adjustment this year means the workers will “fall even further behind not just the private sector, but other state employees.”
“We are devastated. This amounts to punishing our members for asserting their rights in the bargaining process,” she said. “We’re looking at all our options to mitigate the immediate harm to our members.”
Meanwhile, the budget does fund the first-ever collective bargaining agreements with legislative employees in the state House and Senate. They contain the pay hikes provided in agreements with other state worker unions.
It wasn’t a certainty, however. Two of the four affected employee units did not approve their contracts until December. Lawmakers had the entire session to write them into the final deal.
By law, public sector unions in Washington must approve a new contract by Oct. 1 to be considered by a governor for funding in the ensuing two-year budget.
The spending plan approved by the Legislature on Sunday funds multiple contracts containing general pay hikes of 3% on July 1, 2025 and 2% a year later. These agreements also raise the starting wage for state workers to $18 an hour.
Members of the Washington Public Employees Association not receiving those increases work at 14 community colleges and in nine state agencies. Among them are the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Revenue, the Liquor and Cannabis Board and Department of Agriculture. 
Their members overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement on Sept. 30 with the pay hikes. Association negotiators derided the proposal as a pay cut, saying it would not allow worker salaries to keep pace with rising costs. They initially sought a 30% hike.
Union leaders told employees then that rejecting the accord would put them in “uncharted territory.”
Hacker said they hoped to keep bargaining. But the Office of Financial Management, which represents the state, wouldn’t, she said. The union sued to try to force a resumption of talks. Negotiations restarted in December.
The two sides reached a tentative agreement in March and union members ratified it April 3. It has 3% and 2% increases, the same as the other contracts. 
The estimated cost was $55.8 million for the 2025-27 biennium, of which $18.1 million would come from the state general fund. The Office of Financial Management provided the figures to lawmakers in March.
Stanford said he would expect the state agency and union to request money next year to provide wage hikes to the affected employees.
Hacker said there may be other avenues to secure funding for the pay increases. If not, the union will seek to begin talks immediately on a contract to submit to lawmakers in 2026.
“We’re no way near done. Our members are mad. The budget isn’t signed,” Hacker said. 
Any agreement would need to be approved by the union by Oct. 1.
In the meantime, the agreements with legislative staff of the Republican and Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate will provide the same wage hikes offered to other state employee unions — 5% pay hikes spread over two fiscal years.
Legislative assistants in the GOP caucuses unanimously approved contract language by the Oct. 1 deadline. Democratic staff did not, overwhelmingly rejecting proposed contracts with their employers, which are the chief clerk of the House and secretary of the Senate.
Three months later, in late December, legislative assistants, policy analysts and communications staff in the House Democratic Caucus and legislative assistants in the Senate Democratic Caucus ratified their respective agreements. 
A 2022 law cleared the way for partisan legislative staff to unionize and negotiate terms and conditions for the workplace. 
Employees of the Democratic and Republican caucuses in each chamber had to be in separate units unless a majority of each caucus voted to be in the same unit. All four units negotiated collectively on economic issues, like wages and benefits, and separately on workplace-related issues.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1-scaled-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

Deep reductions in spending on Medicaid and food programs for low-income families would have a crushing effect on Florida — from state government, which would have to absorb more of the financial burden; to health care providers who could see their reimbursement rates cut; to the 4.2 million Florida residents who rely on the health care safety net for some form of health care coverage.
Congressional Republicans are intent on deep cuts to Medicaid — $880 billion in the House plan over the next decade and $4 billion for the Senate. The money would extend President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.
But with a recent poll showing no appetite across the political spectrum for cutting Medicaid to pay for tax cuts, Florida advocates hope to convince Congress to reconsider.
The uncertainty comes as Florida lawmakers remain at odds over a new state budget and whether to go forward with a substantial cut in the sales tax rate. Senate President Ben Albritton has said he is unwilling to go along with deep tax cuts for fear of substantial “shortfalls.” Florida contributes a significant portion of the taxes collected at the state level to pay its share of Medicaid.
Florida Policy Institute Chief Strategy and Development Officer Holly Bullard  appeared during a webinar along with Joan Alker, executive director and co-founder of the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy Center for Children and Families (CCF) and a research professor at the Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy; Lynn Hearn, advocacy director, Florida Health Justice Project; and Asheena Moses, statewide outreach and advocacy manager, Florida Impact, to discuss the pending cuts and how they would undermine the state budget if enacted.
Alker shared statistics that underscore how large the Medicaid program is in Florida. In all, she said, Florida receives about $19.5 billion in federal funding for Medicaid, 44% of all federal funds that come into the state.
“That’s an important context, because Medicaid cuts, federal Medicaid cuts, will have a huge impact on the state’s budget — obviously, on Medicaid itself but more broadly on the state’s budget and ability to finance other priorities such as education, infrastructure, public health — whatever it is,” she said. 
In Florida, Medicaid pays for 58% of nursing home stays and 42% of births. Nearly 52% of Florida children living in small towns and rural areas are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Similar to Medicaid, the federal government helps pay the costs of the CHIP program.
“This is extremely meaningful coverage that is really providing just a safety net for so many people, so it covers our most vulnerable individuals at the most vulnerable stages of their lives. So obviously, these aren’t just statistics. They’re real-life people,” said Hearn, whose organization advocates for health care access for all and equity.

 ‘Polly’

Florida established its Medicaid program in 1970. As of February, the latest available data, the program covered 4.2 million people, mostly through Medicaid managed care plans.
The $38 billion program is one of the largest in the nation, but it’s conservative in its approach and who it covers.
“We are pretty frugal when it comes to per capita and per enrolled spending in the Medicaid program,” said Justin Senior, who served as secretary of the state Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) for former Gov. Rick Scott and the state’s Medicaid director before that. 
He is now CEO of the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, which represents some of the largest hospitals in the state, including Jackson Health System, Orlando Health, and Tampa General Hospital.
“If you’re looking for states that don’t spend a lot of money on Medicaid, then Florida has been an excellent steward of taxpayers’ dollars,” he said.
Indeed, Florida legislators maintain that the safety-net program should serve those who need assistance most, such as people with developmental and intellectual disabilities, including “Polly,” who lives in Jacksonville.
Polly’s sister Betsy Dobbins, participated in the webinar with Bullard and Alker to discuss the proposed Medicaid cuts. They would be devastating for Polly, who after nine years on a waiting list was enrolled in the Medicaid waiver program for people with developmental disabilities known as the iBudget program, Dobbins said.
Polly uses iBudget for home and community-based services that keep her living outside of an institution, and attends a day program at the local social services facility run by The Arc. She relies on Medicaid for traditional health care services such as doctor appointments, too.
“Medicaid cuts would be hugely detrimental for Polly in any shape or form,” Dobbins said. “Not just for Polly, but for us and for all of these people who are working every day to take care of people in these health care and systems of care for people like Polly.”










There are really huge cuts that could completely miss Florida and there are big cuts that could hit us.

Although Republicans in the House and Senate have decided upon deep cuts, the particulars remain unsettled. Without knowing those details, Senior said, it’s difficult to see how the reductions will land.
“There are really huge cuts that could completely miss Florida and there are big cuts that could hit us,” Senior said.
KFF analyzed potential repercussions for the states and found Florida would experience a $4 billion recurring reduction in federal Medicaid spending over the next decade if the full $880 billion House cut becomes law. The KFF analysis is illustrative and assumes the federal cuts are proportionally applied to states based on their share of federal spending, and not on policy decisions.
“In practice, cuts would almost certainly not be allocated proportionately, and some states would be disproportionately impacted depending on the specific policy proposals pursued. Without specific policies yet under consideration by Congress, this illustrative analysis is a way of understanding the magnitude of the potential Medicaid cuts,” the authors note.
One proposed reduction that wouldn’t harm Florida involves the federal Medicaid match for states that expanded the program to low-income working adults under the Affordable Care Act. The federal match for that population is 90% — more generous than the traditional Medicaid match which for Florida is roughly 58% (it’s higher for CHIP). That means the federal government pays 58 cents of every Medicaid dollar spent in Florida.
Another way to reduce federal spending is to crack down on so-called “health care provider taxes,” which the state uses as its required match to help fund the program. 
Nursing homes, hospitals, and intermediate care facilities for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities assess these “taxes” upon themselves, rather than run them through the state fiscal system. This allows the state to book lower social services spending while supplying cash for the federally mandated Medicaid match. The mechanism is common among the various states.
The Congressional Budget Office has argued that Congress could save hundreds of billions of dollars by altering or eliminating provider tax options. The discussions generally center around lowering the “safe harbor” that allows states to use hold-harmless arrangements when the provider taxes don’t exceed 6% of net revenue from treating patients.
Hold-harmless arrangements ensure that the taxes collected are  returned to providers in the form of higher Medicaid payments.
Hospitals’ provider taxes run well below that 6% safe harbor, so if Congress adjusts that slightly downward it shouldn’t beggar those providers, Senior said.
His association has been lobbying Congress, trying to ease any hit on Florida’s Medicaid program. So, too, has the Florida Health Care Association, which represents a large swath of Florida’s nursing homes.
“With over two-thirds of our residents relying on Medicaid to cover the cost of their long-term care, reductions to the provider assessment could limit options for our frail elders and their families,” FHCA spokesperson Kristen Knapp said in a written statement.
“We’re working with the American Health Care Association to help Congress understand that Medicaid is a key safety net for our most vulnerable and it must remain strong as our aging population continues to grow,” she said.
The first Trump administration tried to crack down on Medicaid provider taxes. Then–Florida Medicaid Director Beth Kidder wrote a letter opposing the move, saying it would “cripple” the state’s Medicaid program.
Senior, though, is a little more hopeful than Kidder.
“We got to see where it all lands. You could see a package of reductions that would impact Florida or you could see a package that wouldn’t have much of an impact on Florida or Florida hospitals at all,” he said.
Why now?
With some economists predicting a 60% chance of a recession during 2025, Alker also wants to know: Why now?
Medicaid is a counter-cyclical program, meaning enrollment increases during economic downturns. Congress, recognizing that, has generally increased federal matching funds during recessions, Alker noted.
“The fact that Congress would be contemplating one of the biggest cuts in Medicaid that we likely have ever seen at a time when, if the country is going into recession, normally Congress would be increasing Medicaid funding, I think, is a really important point.”
  Joan Alker executive director and co-founder of the Center for Children and Families and a research professor at the Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy.
 Don’t forget about the food

Advocates also warned about reductions to SNAP, the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which serves 2.9 million people in Florida. Since the program’s inception, the benefits have always been federally funded, although the state has had to pay half the costs of administering the program.
As part of the budget process, the House agreed to trim $230 billion in agricultural spending. However, there are widespread doubts Congress would cut farm subsidies and will look to cut the SNAP program instead, said Bullard, of the Florida Policy Institute.
“We want to lift up that this additional care program that is also counter-cyclical that is also something that our communities rely on that it is under threat as well.”
Hearn says the federal government is considering requiring the states to help pay for the costs of the benefit.
“And states have never had to do this before, nor are they prepared or have had conversations to do so. And so, just straight math is pretty easy to understand what this would do to the states’ budgets,” Hearn said.
A 10% cost shift to the state would increase costs for Florida by $657 million annually, Hearn said.
Asheena Moses, outreach and advocacy manager for Florida Impact, said there’s a strong connection between good nutrition and good health. Florida Impact is a statewide organization dedicated to advancing health equity by eliminating hunger.
“If SNAP is provided to families and families are able to provide nutritious meals to their children, they are less likely to get sick and be dependent on Medicaid programs, Moses said. 
“SNAP also lifts families out of poverty. It frees up funding for them to get out of debt and it also frees up funding for them to establish themselves in a way that they can be self sufficient — like paying for trade programs or paying for different certifications so that they can get jobs where they make enough money to be lifted out of poverty and difficult situations,” she said.

Yet for over a decade, a little-known law has been quietly increasing your electric bill while stifling innovation in our energy infrastructure.
In 2012, Minnesota passed a “Right of First Refusal” law for electric transmission lines. While the Vikings stadium deal dominated legislative attention, 216B.246 passed unanimously in both chambers. This law gives incumbent utility companies the exclusive right to build new high-voltage transmission lines that connect to their existing infrastructure.
The consequences have been profound and costly for Minnesota ratepayers.
Before this law, Minnesota enjoyed electricity rates significantly lower than the national average — about 18% below in 2001 and still 13% lower in 2011.
Then came the ROFR law in 2012, and this advantage began eroding rapidly. By 2013, rates were only 6.5% below the national average. The downward trend continued until 2020, when rates were virtually identical to the national average — a mere 0.2% lower. While there have been slight improvements recently, Minnesota is nowhere near its former competitive advantage.
This isn’t just about losing an economic edge — it’s a failure to meet the state’s own legal requirements. Minnesota law explicitly mandates that electricity rates should be 5% below the national average. Current rates fail this standard, putting Minnesota in violation of its own energy policy goals.
The ROFR law effectively creates a monopoly, allowing incumbent utilities to build transmission projects without facing competition from potentially more efficient, innovative or cost-effective providers.
Research consistently shows that competitive bidding on transmission projects reduces costs by 20-30%. In the MISO region (which includes Minnesota), competitively bid projects have yielded overall cost savings of 37% for ratepayers. These aren’t small numbers considering the multi-billion-dollar scale of transmission infrastructure. For the average Minnesota family, this could mean significant relief on monthly electric bills.
The stated purpose of the ROFR law is often described as protecting consumers and incumbent utilities from “out-of-state competition.” Instead, it has shielded utilities from any competition, removing incentives to innovate, control costs, or improve efficiency. Under the current law, even if an incumbent utility decides not to build a needed transmission line, alternatives can only be considered after the incumbent formally declines — creating further delays and complications.
The timing for action is critical. Without competitive bidding, massive infrastructure investments will be built at monopoly prices, potentially driving electricity rates even further above the statutory requirement.
Currently, bills SF434 and HF2553 aim to repeal Minnesota’s ROFR law. This repeal represents a crucial opportunity to restore competition, reverse the trend of diminishing rate advantages, and deliver much-needed price relief to Minnesota consumers.
Critics may argue that changing the law will create uncertainty. But courts in other states have already shown the path forward. In Iowa, the Supreme Court characterized their ROFR as “crony capitalism” in 2023. Similarly, Texas courts ruled that ROFRs are “unconstitutional because they violate the dormant Commerce Clause.”
Despite these judicial setbacks, the utility industry continues to push for ROFR laws nationwide. Oklahoma has seen ROFR bills proposed every year for the past four years. Wisconsin is battling to prevent similar legislation. And in Iowa, despite court rulings, new bills have been proposed with the same misleading justifications used when Minnesota’s law was enacted.
The evidence is clear: Monopoly by statute doesn’t work. Competition drives innovation, efficiency, and ultimately, the price relief that Minnesota consumers need.
For a state that values innovation, fair competition, and consumer interests, Minnesota’s ROFR law is an anomaly that must be addressed. Since its enactment, Minnesotans have watched their electricity rate advantage disappear.
It’s time for Minnesota to repeal this costly monopoly protection and restore the competitive advantage it once enjoyed. The state’s energy future — and the relief on your electric bill — depends on it.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tariffphoto2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

(From Holcomb's official Flickr)The Indiana Economic Development Foundation has poured more than $13 million into travel, administrative and other expenses across six years, according to audited financial reports released Thursday under Gov. Mike Braun’s orders.
The little-known foundation is charged with raising private funds to boost the controversial Indiana Economic Development Corp. But the nonprofit is on a spending freeze.
State freezes funding for economic development affiliate, promises audit

Indiana had a traditional commerce department until 2005. That’s when, under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, lawmakers created the IEDC: “a body politic and corporate, not a state agency but an independent instrumentality exercising essential public functions,” per Indiana Code. They allowed its board to create a subsidiary: the foundation.
“Everybody always thinks that the tax dollars are going in one direction: they’re going out to nonprofits to subsidize nonprofit activity,” said Indiana University Professor Beth Gazley, a nonprofit management specialist.
“But actually, there’s a lot of money coming back from nonprofits to subsidize government activities,” she continued, noting that the federal definition of a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit includes “lessening the burdens of government.”
The IEDC’s furtive efforts to secure water, land and more for a contentious technology park have made it plenty of enemies since 2022. But now, its problems go beyond public relations.
Braun said Thursday that he’s ordered a forensic audit and reported “impropriety, or even the appearance of it” to Indiana’s Office of Inspector General amid allegations of self-dealing and more, first reported by Indiana Legislative Insight.
And he’s taken aim at the foundation.
In an April 9 news release, his administration called out the foundation for not filing six years of required audited financial reports with the State Budget Committee. Two weeks later, the lapses were cured and the reports available online.
A spokesperson for the quasi-public agency didn’t immediately answer Capital Chronicle questions, including why those records weren’t submitted.
Reports reveal spending’s focus
The newly released reports show that the foundation spent $13.2 million from the 2019 through 2024 fiscal years, which begin July 1 and end June 30.
The bulk of that, $10.9 million, went to travel, meals and entertainment. Years worth of news releases indicate the foundation has paid for virtually all of the international economic development trips taken by prior governors.
The independent auditor used for the most recent three reports — Indianapolis’ Katz, Sapper & Miller — also included conferences in this category, while the previous one — Missouri’s former BKD — did not.
“Is that a lot of money to be spending on conferences, travel, meals and entertainment? That really depends on the programmatic goals of the organization, the mission of the organization,” Gazley said. “And only the board can decide: is that the best use of our funding?”


The IEDC and its foundation share the same staff and 12-member board.
Gazley also said it’s “best practice” to change auditors over time. Get too “close and clubby” and risk the auditor “not being honest anymore about the financial status of the organization,” she warned.
Another $1.8 million was logged for administrative expenses, plus more than $200,000 for sponsorships.
Nearly $300,000 was categorized as “other” spending. The foundation didn’t immediately answer a question about what kinds of expenditures would fit within this category.
Donor information remains largely under wraps
The reports also disclose about $11.7 million in donations. But they offer no clues as to the identity of those donors. Indiana Code forces the foundation to redact donor names out of public records if they request anonymity at any point in time.
Most do.
The groups behind 14 of 16 transactions from 2020 through 2022 were shielded from records obtained in 2023 by the Capital Chronicle. Two didn’t request anonymity: District of Columbia-based think tank The Urban Institute donated $5,000 in 2021, and the Battery Innovation Center in Newberry gave $12,000 in 2022. Between 2015 and 2025, the center nabbed six incentive contracts that total $18 million, according to the IEDC’s transparency portal.
At the time, spokeswoman Erin Sweitzer wrote that private donations “allow more flexibility in how we use the funds and how quickly we’re able to access them.”
For Gazley, that doesn’t add up.
“I don’t see how you can defend privacy as a programmatic priority, or a mission-related priority. You just can’t,” she said. “But privacy does make a lot of organizations more viable if their donors are concerned about having their (donation) choices on the front page of the newspaper.”
“The kinds of accountability tools that we have for the public with, if I ordered them in priority, transparency would be at the top of the list. And I think it should be at (the) top of everybody’s list,” she added later.
But there are indications of who other foundation givers may be — and evidence several have dealings with the IEDC. Organizations can donate money, sponsor events or provide in-kind services.

A webpage for the foundation identifies the state’s “big five” investor-owned utilities — AES Indiana, CenterPoint Energy, Duke Energy, Indiana Michigan Power and the Northern Indiana Public Service Company — as “contributors.”
AES logged $10 million in professional services contracts that expired in 2023 and about $2.8 million in incentive contracts from 2014, according to the portal, while Duke earned about $150 million in an incentive contract from 2010. Incentives are performance-based, so a recipient may not earn the full amount if its targets aren’t met.
Nine other organizations are dubbed “sponsors” on the webpage. They include Old National Bank, Pure Development, Rolls-Royce, Hoosier Energy, Solv Energy, Doral Renewables, railroad giant Norfolk Southern, workforce development consultant TPMA, and Indiana University’s Ventures startup affiliate.
Pure Development holds a $94.4 million contract for development work. Rolls-Royce received $21,000 after co-sponsoring a Northwest Stadium suite with IEDC for an Army-Navy football match in December and racked up 14 incentive contracts — worth $74.6 million — between 2011 and 2022.
Doral Renewables, meanwhile, is the recipient of two pending incentive contracts totaling $1.5 million. TPMA was recorded as having three service contracts — for almost $190,000 — expiring between 2019 and 2025, and two 2015 incentive contracts worth nearly $400,000.
There’s also more information on the way.
Though the foundation secured an exemption from the Internal Revenue Service in 2012 for future filings of the Form 990, Braun has directed it and other state-affiliated nonprofits to file them annually, regardless of any exemptions. The form describes funding sources and amounts, and how much has been spent on programming versus administrative expenses.
All required reports going back 10 years are due by the end of 2025 under his executive order. They must also be “clearly posted” online “for Hoosiers to read for themselves,” according to a news release.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington State. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.


They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Ed Murray for New Jersey Monitor)Lawmakers like to tout New Jersey as the “state for second chances,” citing its expungement law as a crucial tool for helping people move on from their mistakes.
But should cops who commit serious crimes that they later get expunged get to hide their wrongdoing from the public they police?
That was the question before the New Jersey Supreme Court Tuesday, when justices heard arguments in the case of a Jersey City police lieutenant who got his felony charges expunged after authorities say he downed six to eight beers and then shot at his guests during a dispute at a party at his Sussex County home.
States Newsroom, the parent company of New Jersey Monitor, sued Jersey City in 2022 after officials there refused to release the police department’s internal affairs report on the August 2019 incident that led state troopers to charge Lt. Michael Timmins with terroristic threats and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes. County prosecutors allowed Timmins to complete a pretrial diversionary program that cleared the way for expungement, even though his offenses violated the Graves Act, a state law that requires mandatory prison sentences for some gun crimes.
City officials defended their refusal to disclose Timmins’ disciplinary file as necessary under the state’s expungement statute, which threatens violators who knowingly disclose expunged records with a $200 fine and disorderly conduct charge.
Internal affairs reports are not public records under New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act. But a state Supreme Court ruling from March 2022 requires police to release internal affairs reports under the common law right of access when the public’s interest in them outweighs an officer’s confidentiality concerns, noted attorney CJ Griffin, who represents the New Jersey Monitor.
The city’s denial also came before a judge approved Timmins’ expungement request, compounding officials’ error in their failure to disclose, Griffin added. That wrongly impeded the New Jersey Monitor from alerting the public about a problematic officer whose “sweetheart deal” to dodge discipline raises questions about police accountability in Jersey City, the state’s second-largest city, she said.
“The IA unit concluded that it was merely negligent behavior, and this officer received only a 90-day suspension and is still on this force despite his dangerous behavior that could have resulted in killing someone,” Griffin told justices Tuesday.
The city’s response to Timmins’ misconduct is even more of a matter of public concern because Jersey City’s longtime mayor, Steven Fulop, is now running for New Jersey governor, she added.
“Transparency is very important to the public, trusting the police. And the public often feels that police are given special treatment, that they cover up for each other, that the internal affairs unit doesn’t hold their fellow officers accountable. And I’ve personally seen that every time we come to this court and obtain a landmark decision that gives us transparency, then we see agencies finding a way to evade that transparency. So those things are all present in this case,” Griffin said.
Attorneys from the state attorney general’s and public defenders’ offices joined Griffin in arguing that such disclosure is warranted, though for slightly different reasons.
Viviana M. Hanley, representing the Attorney General’s Office, said such internal affairs records should be made public to protect the public’s trust in police accountability — as long as they’re redacted to hide things a judge has ordered expunged, such as the cop’s arrest, detention, trial, and offense.
Michael Noveck, from the Office of the Public Defender, echoed that sentiment but rejected the idea of redactions. Officers’ misconduct — including expunged crimes — serve as exculpatory and impeachment evidence that authorities are obligated to share with the juries that are tasked with weighing the credibility of cops who testify against criminal defendants, Noveck said. Details of Timmins’ arrest were revealed in just such a case.
Attorney Jeremy Jacobsen, representing Jersey City, countered that the state’s expungement statute contains no exceptions that allow expunged records to be disclosed to media outlets.
“We need to make sure that we are adhering to the plain language of the statute, because there’s a lot at risk here if we get it wrong,” Jacobsen said. “We’re exposing our employees to criminal penalties here.”
The New Jersey Monitor’s fight is a policy one that should be fought in the Statehouse, he added.
“If they’re looking for public policy changes, they’re in the wrong building. They should be lobbying the Legislature,” he said.
Democrat running for governor wants more transparency in Trenton — what about in his own backyard?

The Municipal Clerks’ Association of New Jersey backed Jacobsen, with attorney Michael S. Carucci telling the justices that clerks labor under “this heavy cloud” of risking a disorderly persons offense for wrongly releasing expunged records. Disclosure laws require public officials to reveal reasons for redactions, so clerks weighing whether to release information on expunged cases risk litigation either from requestors who get no answer when they challenge redactions or from officers who feel their expungements were wrongly revealed, he added.
“The cat would be out of the bag. The requester would know that something’s up here, that there is expunged information,” Carucci said.
Such concerns did give some justices pause.
“Under what authority can this court overrule the Legislature when it passes a law that says ‘X’ will not be disclosed?” Justice Rachel Wainer Apter asked Griffin.
Griffin underscored that New Jersey Monitor’s request for Timmins’ internal affairs report predated the expungement.
“The facts were all public when we filed the request and when we filed the lawsuit,” she said.
In further questioning over nearly three hours of arguments, some justices seemed to side with disclosure, possibly with redactions to protect information excluded under the expungement statute.
Internal affairs investigators weigh administrative violations, more so than crimes, and the expungement statute applies to criminal justice matters rather than workplace discipline, Wainer Apter noted.
“I’m just having trouble understanding why if a criminal proceeding — if the person happens to be charged with a crime, the entire existence of the IA investigation all of a sudden becomes expunged,” she said.
It’s unclear when the court will return a ruling.

One win was expanded life insurance for Indiana National Guard members. Lawmakers approved a long-overdue increase in coverage — from $8,000 to $20,000 — for those who die while serving on state active duty orders.
The General Assembly also modernized charitable gaming. Veteran service organizations can now use electronic pull-tabs and apply revenues more flexibly. This modernization was decades in the making.
Businesses assisting veterans with their benefits must now be accredited and required to inform veterans of the free services available to them.
The Indiana Code now recognizes the U.S. Space Force, U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps — making their income exempt from state tax.
These are meaningful steps, but they pale in comparison to the support veterans deserve and the issues left unaddressed.
What we lost or never gained
Despite its potential to save lives, especially for veterans with traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress, the proposed hyperbaric oxygen therapy program failed to advance.
And there is still no restoration of tuition remission for children of disabled veterans, a benefit stripped away in 2011 and not returned.
Once again, Indiana’s reserve forces were left behind, with no state-funded education support.
We stopped a House attempt to raid the Veterans Affairs Trust Fund of $1.25 Million annually for a state program only to see the Senate reinsert the same provision. The Military Family Relief Fund, funded by Hoosiers to support veterans in need, is being quietly siphoned off to fund state agency advertising. Up to 10% of the fund is taken each year, despite the agency already having a communications staff and outside marketing firm on payroll.
That same agency also blocked a bill that would have allowed disabled veterans to access hyperbaric oxygen therapy through the fund. Veterans were denied critical care and a bureaucracy won out. That’s not supporting veterans, that’s exploiting them.
Property taxes
In 1975, Indiana honored disabled veterans with a property tax deduction of $24,950—when the average home cost just $39,000. An additional $14,000 was granted for the totally disabled. Many paid little to no property taxes as a result. It was a tangible, targeted acknowledgment of their sacrifice.

Fast forward to 2025: In an attempt to address broader property tax issues, the General Assembly proposed folding veterans into a general tax credit system.
Under the original plan: all homeowners would get a $300 credit and disabled veterans would receive an additional $250.
Those over 62 or totally disabled would get another $150. However, those over 62 and totally disabled would be excluded from the senior credit entirely.
This was not a continuation of the original benefit, it was a replacement that undermined it. Veterans spoke out. The Indiana American Legion issued a call to action. The Military Veterans Coalition of Indiana mobilized. On the final day of session, lawmakers reversed course and reinstated the original property tax deduction for disabled veterans.
While that correction matters, it shouldn’t be viewed as a win. It was a fix for a mistake that should never have been made and it still leaves the deduction unchanged from 50 years ago. No adjustment for inflation. No reflection of today’s housing market. Just the bare minimum to maintain appearances.
Veteran benefits
Also in the final hours of session, lawmakers inserted language into a conference report that fundamentally alters who is eligible for benefits in Indiana throughout the Indiana code. Anywhere the law previously required an “Honorable Discharge,” it now reads “Anything Other Than Dishonorable.”
This opens the door to eligibility for those with bad conduct and other-than-honorable discharges. To manage this, the Indiana Veterans Commission is tasked with reviewing DD-214 discharge codes which the Department of Defense stopped publicly sharing in 2022. This is a bureaucratic workaround to a problem that shouldn’t exist. The longstanding definition of a veteran, one who earned benefits through honorable service is being rewritten without adequate oversight or public input. Benefits come with honorable service. Period. Rewriting that standard isn’t equity, it’s erasure.
This session proved that vigilance is necessary. When legislators tried to undermine or redirect hard-earned benefits, veterans stood up, spoke out, and pushed back. And we’re not done.
Hoosier veterans live to fight another day. And fight we will.

(Screenshot of Court of Appeals livestream)Do streaming services count as video service providers and should they be subject to franchise fees like traditional cable TV? Judges Melissa May, Elizabeth Tavitas and Paul Felix weighed the above question in a remote hearing held at Wabash College on Tuesday.
Also at question was whether lawmakers unconstitutionally intervened in 2023 to nullify a lawsuit filed by four Indiana cities seeking to recoup franchise fees from some streaming service providers.  
In August 2020, four cities sued a handful of streaming services seeking franchise fees equal to 5% of local gross revenue for using facilities in the public right-of-way, similar to how cable television stations operate. 
A 2006 law requires video service providers to be licensed with the state and pay quarterly franchise fees to cities and other governments. But the cities of Fishers, Indianapolis, Evansville and Valparaiso say that streaming giants like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, DirectTV and Dish Network haven’t complied. 
Such companies depend on Internet services, specifically shared cables that are part of the greater utility framework accessed through public right-of-way. 
  Michael Limrick, a partner with Hoover Hull Turner LLP, argues on behalf of four cities before the Indiana Court of Appeals on April 29, 2025. (Screenshot of Court of Appeals livestream)
“I’m accessing the Hulu programming via the Internet, but I can only access that because the programming has traveled through the public right-of-way to get to my house,” argued attorney Michael Limrick on behalf of the cities. “… if I’m going to pull up programming on my phone that will have been broadcast to my phone from a tower that may be sitting in the public right-of-way.”
Broadcasting through satellite services, for example, wouldn’t be included under Indiana’s video service provider law, Limrick said. 
But, rather than letting such questions play out in the courts, the General Assembly intervened, tweaking the definition of video service providers in a way that killed the effort.
The original version of the bill that became House Enrolled Act 1454 didn’t include any mention of video service providers, but as the 2023 bill grew from 42 pages to 282 pages, it picked up provisions. The relevant addition explicitly said that video programming offered over the Internet isn’t considered to be a video service provider — and then backdated the language to 2006, when the franchise fees were established. 
On Tuesday, judges also wondered whether re-opening up the definition in a way that includes the Internet might capture other forms of video content, such as creators on YouTube and TikTok. 
“We have these YouTube producers that are making all of these videos … somebody like a Mr. Beast, who now has huge production abilities. He’s not just a guy with a cell phone anymore taking videos of the crazy things he’s doing,” said Felix. “It begins to blur the line as to what is video programming that’s similar to regular broadcast.” 
Limrick argued that accessing YouTube videos aren’t all fee based, though he acknowledged there’s a separate, paid service for watching live television and ad-free videos built into the platform. 
 The case for streaming services

Citing the new law, a trial court judge ruled in favor of the streaming services to dismiss the case and ruled that the additions were constitutional in June 2024. A story from the Northwest Indiana Times detailing the bill’s journey to become law reported that the author said the language came from a lobbyist affiliated with Dish Network. 
But the cities continued to argue that lawmakers overstepped by adding the video service provider language to a bill that initially sought to address certain Department of Local Government Finance concerns — in effect, creating “special” legislation.
 


				Attorney General Todd Rokita, arguing on behalf of the General Assembly, affirmed the trial court’s ruling on the constitutionality of the legislature’s actions in a December filing. However, should judges rule otherwise, he urged the appeals court to sever the specific portion of House Enrolled Act 1454 concerning video streaming providers from the rest of the law. 
“… but this remedy is unnecessary in this case because (House Enrolled Act) 1454 is constitutional,” he continued. “Therefore, this Court should affirm the order of dismissal.” 			



Peter E. Davis, arguing on behalf of Netflix and others, said it didn’t count as special legislation and simply clarified existing law — noting that it mirrors how other states have approached the issue. 
“The cities’ arguments today undermine the General Assembly’s ability to legislate, both for this case and for the future,” said Davis. “… The cities’ argument would make such amendments impossible, locking Indiana into taxes and fees passed in a different time, in a different day, with no ability to adjust.” 
  Peter E. Davis, an attorney with Latham & Watkins LLP, argues on behalf of streaming services before the Indiana Court of Appeals on April 29, 2025. (Screenshot from Indiana Court of Appeals livestream)
Davis said it was his understanding that Internet service providers don’t pay franchise fees either. Additionally, since the companies are “agnostic” about how users access their offerings — whether by phone, Internet or otherwise — he said it makes “very little sense to impose a fee” on streaming.
“What the Internet service provider is doing is very different than what a cable company is doing … they’re enabling access to all kinds of content. So it’s not just video, but it’s email. It’s information; it’s social media; it’s video games,” said Davis. “It doesn’t make any sense to impose franchise fees on just one piece of something that the Internet service provider — whose not even the streaming company here — is ultimately providing.”
He also pointed to a 2022 report from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission concluding that “streaming video is not treated as a traditional video provider and, therefore, is not required to obtain a state-issued franchise.”
However, in a rebuttal, Limrick argued against the notion that the legislature only wanted to regulate the companies installing wiring for the Internet in the public right-of-way. 
“It could do that; it hasn’t done that,” said Limrick. “What the act regulates are companies that transmit video programming through facilities located, at least in part, in the public right-of-way.
“… the act says nothing about who owns those facilities,” continued Limrick, referring to the 2006 law. 
Carving out streaming services who operate using the Internet, he said, would be special treatment. 
Felix noted a “tension” created by the arguments because any ruling would impact not only existing streaming services but companies yet to be created. The three judges didn’t indicate when to anticipate their ruling.

Program participants enroll in AmeriCorps and are paid an hourly wage for their work. (Photo courtesy of Western Dairyland EOC Inc.) A coalition of 25 states, including Wisconsin, sued the Trump administration Tuesday to block the cancellation of AmeriCorps programs across the country.
The cancellation has upended plans at more than two dozen organizations in Wisconsin that have engaged AmeriCorps members in community service work, and stranded scores of participants in the midst of one-year stints in the program.
“I was completely blindsided,” Parker Kuehni told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday. The University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate with a degree in global health was in his second year with AmeriCorps, working at a Madison free health clinic and preparing to start medical school in June when he learned Monday morning that the program was canceled.
Created by Congress in 1993 as the Corporation for National and Community Service, its official name, AmeriCorps has deployed community service workers across the country in the decades since. AmeriCorps members are usually recent college graduates who join the program for a year or two. They teach in schools, assist with disaster relief and take on a host of other roles. 
Wisconsin has 25 AmeriCorps programs that operate at more than 300 locations across the state, according to the office of Gov. Tony Evers. In Wisconsin, AmeriCorps operates through Serve Wisconsin, which administers its Wisconsin contracts and is housed in the Department of Administration.
On April 16, AmeriCorps placed about 75% of its employees on administrative leave with pay, the New York Times reported.
At 6:20 p.m. on Friday, April 25, Jeanne Duffy, the Serve Wisconsin executive director, received an email message that AmeriCorps grants and their recipients in Wisconsin were being terminated immediately “because it has been determined that the award no longer effectuates agency priorities.”
The form letter instructed recipients to notify all organizations and agencies with AmeriCorps-related projects. “You must immediately cease all award activities. This is a final agency action and is not administratively appealable,” the message said.
Lawsuit: Cancellation ‘usurps Congress’s power of the purse’
The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Maryland charges the Trump administration’s cancellation of the program “flouts Congress’s creation of AmeriCorps and assignment of agency duties; usurps Congress’s power of the purse and thereby violates the Constitution’s separation of powers; and arbitrarily and capriciously — without any reasoned analysis — vitiates the agency’s ability to function consistent with its statutory mission and purpose.”
The suit charges that the program’s abrupt end also violates federal law, which states AmeriCorps can make “significant changes to program requirements, service delivery or policy only through public notice and comment rulemaking.”
“The attempt to dismantle AmeriCorps is part of a pattern from the Trump administration of disrespect toward those who serve others,” Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement. “That approach is not just shameful — it’s misguided. AmeriCorps volunteers and projects help strengthen communities. AmeriCorps should be thanked for its work, not abruptly dismantled.”
Evers’ office telegraphed Wisconsin’s plan to join the lawsuit late Tuesday morning.
“Once again, the Trump Administration is trying to cut federal funding that Congress already approved and Wisconsin is counting on to help kids, families, and communities across our state — all so they can pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,” Evers said in a statement. “These latest reckless Trump and Musk cuts will hurt Wisconsin’s kids who are homeless or who need tutors for math and reading, folks who are working to overcome addiction and substance use, stop work on conservation projects, as well as all of the dedicated public servants whose livelihoods are depending on this work.”
Tutoring programs, health care clinics
AmeriCorps’ cancellation affected organizations and agencies all across the state.
In Madison, the United Way of Dane County enlisted 27 AmeriCorps members in two tutoring programs — one in math for high school students and the other in reading and literacy for elementary school children.
AmeriCorps members were placed in schools to help identify students who would benefit from tutoring, United Way officials said. They also screened and conducted background checks for more than 175 community volunteer tutors as well as serving as tutors themselves. More than 1,000 children have received tutoring in the two programs this year.
“And these kids are able to accelerate their academic success, which puts them on track for [higher] graduation rates,” said United Way CEO Renee Moe. “So, this is a really huge loss for us.”
AmeriCorps members were “really key to having successful volunteers support students in literacy,” said Emily Greene, director of Schools of Hope, the elementary program.
In the high school program, Achievement Connections, members have supported and trained other high school students as peer tutors. That helps those students “be engaged in their school in a way that they otherwise wouldn’t be and also gain some skills,” said Karl Johnson, director of Achievement Connections.
“We find that those relationships . . . are some of our strongest when it’s students helping each other out, and our [AmeriCorps] members are a pretty key part of facilitating that,” Johnson said.
The Wisconsin Association of Free and Charitable Clinics has deployed 30 AmeriCorps members throughout Wisconsin this year.
Some assist clinics, local health departments or the state Department of Health Services in administrative tasks, writing grants, collecting and analyzing data and related work, said Domonique Coffee, the association’s AmeriCorps program manager. Others staff clinics in a public health role, taking a patient’s blood pressure or other vital signs, teaching patients about managing their diabetes or hypertension or providing other direct care, she said.
The program allowed “free and charitable clinics to increase their services and capacity for services . . . to those who are underinsured or uninsured,” Coffee said.
It has also helped prepare the AmeriCorps members as future health care providers — “the future physicians and public health leaders of our next generation,” she added.
Fostering skills for careers and life
Parker Kuehni had graduated with a degree in global public health two years ago and was preparing to go to medical school. But he knew he first wanted to get more experience in directly working with patients.
He volunteered as a barbershop health screener for the Perry Family Free Clinic, which serves uninsured, low-income Madison residents. Through the clinic he connected with AmeriCorps and then shifted to helping with patient coordination, communication and scheduling, discussing care plans with patients and managing referrals to specialists.
The experience “built my empathy for people,” he said. The experiences he had “will contribute to me being an overall better future physician.”
While the typical AmeriCorps participant is a college graduate, the Western Dairyland Economic Opportunity Council in Eau Claire took a different approach with the program.
Since the late 1990s Western Dairyland has operated Fresh Start, an education, skills and career program for young adults ages 18 to 25. Participants often have a sparse job history and might not have completed high school.
The program engages up to 15 participants in a year-long house-building project. “We provide them with life skills and job skills and technical education, allowing them to then leave the program and either go on to school or attain full-time employment,” said Dale Karls, Western Dairyland’s communications coordinator.
The participants themselves become AmeriCorps members and earn an hourly wage on the job. Some 600 young people have gone through the program over the last three decades, building 45 homes, Karls said.
All the organizations the Wisconsin Examiner contacted Tuesday said the news of AmeriCorps’ cancellation came too recently  for them to know what they will do if the program isn’t restored.
Coffee said the Wisconsin Free and Charitable Clinics Association is trying to support its AmeriCorps members, “helping them find their footing.”
At United Way of Dane County, “We’ve spoken to our school district partners,” said Moe, the agency’s CEO. “We have reaffirmed with them that tutoring continues to be an important strategy to help with academic success. And so right now we’re trying to be creative around how to best keep really effective tutoring programs going.”
“We’re hoping that the funding will be reinstated,” said Karls of Western Dairyland. In the meantime, he added, “We have a half-constructed house in Strum, Wisconsin. We have to find a way to finish that.”

(Courtesy of the Utah Senate)Utah state leaders are taking the next steps in their efforts to make Utah a major nuclear energy development hub and a “national leader” in developing next-generation energy technology, reaching beyond state lines to do it.
It starts with Utah signing two memorandums of understanding with Idaho and Wyoming as part of a strategy to fire up innovation and collaboration in the region.
Idaho, feds agree to waiver of 1995 settlement agreement on nuclear fuel storage

As part of Gov. Spencer Cox’s “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit,” which his office said brought together leaders from across the nuclear energy industry on Tuesday, Cox joined Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon in signing an MOU that calls for the three states to work together coordinating nuclear infrastructure, accelerating nuclear development, and advocating for “commonsense federal policies.”
“The West will lead the next chapter of energy abundance and American prosperity,” Cox said in a statement announcing the alliance. “Today, we brought together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to chart the course for nuclear energy. Our new compact strengthens our shared commitment to aggressively pursue more affordable, reliable energy across state lines.”
According to Cox’s office, the states agreed in the MOU to collaborate on:

Aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment.
Coordinating the development of critical energy infrastructure.
Jointly navigating regulatory and environmental challenges.
Advocating for federal support of regional energy priorities.
Enhancing energy resilience and grid reliability.
Expanding workforce development efforts to support the growing energy sector.
Ensuring continued delivery of affordable energy to residents.

 Utah, Idaho National Laboratory establish ‘formal, long-term collaboration’

The tri-state agreement comes the day after Utah officials and the Idaho National Laboratory — one of 17 national labs in the U.S. Department of Energy complex that’s focused on nuclear research — signed a memorandum of understanding Monday evening after ceremoniously signing a slate of energy bills Utah lawmakers passed earlier this year.
The MOU between Utah leaders and the Idaho National Laboratory establishes a “formal, long-term collaboration on advanced energy research, workforce development and technology deployment — particularly on nuclear innovation,” according to the governor’s office.

“This partnership will accelerate Utah’s efforts to become the nation’s nuclear hub,” Gov. Cox said in a prepared statement issued Monday evening. “By linking our universities, labs, and industry partners with the expertise of Idaho National Laboratory, we are strengthening our ability to serve Utahns with reliable and affordable energy.”
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner, who signed the MOU, said he and other lab officials are “excited to partner with Utah to address urgent energy needs by focusing on advanced nuclear and energy innovation.”
“This partnership establishes a cooperative framework for scientific, technological and workforce development to help Utah realize an abundant, secure, resilient and competitive energy future,” he said.
The MOU, according to the Utah governor’s office, creates a “structural, interdisciplinary alliance” between Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory. It envisions Utah as establishing a new institute called the Advanced Nuclear Energy Institute as a “key coordinating hub” between the Idaho National Laboratory, Utah’s system of higher education, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab.
“By linking the capabilities of INL with the talent and resources of Utah’s higher education institutions, this partnership positions Utah as a national leader in developing the next generation of clean, secure and resilient energy technologies,” the governor’s office said in Monday’s news release.
This new institute, state officials say, will enable Utah’s universities to collaborate with other organizations to pursue federal research grants.
“Beyond academic research, the focus is on applied innovation — ensuring resources are used effectively to develop commercially viable, scalable technologies,” the governor’s office said. “This approach will accelerate the deployment of real-world energy solutions and help build a broader, more robust nuclear energy ecosystem in Utah and the surrounding region.”
 How will the state of Utah and the INL work together?

Through the MOU, state leaders say Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory will work together to:

Accelerate development of “next-generation” nuclear technologies.
Enhance scientific research in energy sectors.
Strengthen cybersecurity and physical security for energy infrastructure.
Build up the workforce needed to meet demands of a future energy economy.

The Utah Legislature’s top Republican leaders applauded the move as crucial for Utah’s future.
“Affordable, reliable energy is the driving force behind Utah’s prosperity — powering everything from the lights in Utahns homes to the unstoppable growth of the state’s vibrant economy,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a prepared statement. “As energy demands increase and technologies rapidly evolve, we as a state are committed to staying ahead of the curve through strategic partnership that ensures both innovation and stability.”
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Utah “is leading the way with smart, strategic investments in our energy future.”
“This partnership drives innovation and keeps energy reliable and affordable for Utah families and businesses,” Schultz said. “It’s about long-term solutions that protect our economy and strengthen our position as a national energy leader.”

But ultimately Allen’s story ended in tragedy, after Marko said Child Protective Services, or CPS, failed to act on multiple occasions.
“The warning bells had been going off for years, and nothing was done,” Marko told lawmakers, saying that when Allen was 2 months old, CPS was aware he had been beaten, sustaining a black eye and abrasions to his genitalia, and was living in a home with no beds.
“It was rat infested. The rats had actually eaten through the pack and play that him and his siblings had been left in and [the rats had] eaten holes in the pack and play,” Marko said.
In this instance, Allen and his siblings were removed from the home, but were later placed back with their mother, Marko said, adding that two months later Allen was found with burns on his hands when CPS came to the home again.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Marko is one of the attorneys working on a lawsuit filed a month ago against employees of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Children’s Protective Services Division. It outlines the multiple interactions Allen had with CPS, with evidence reflecting that Allen was rendered blind and suffered from frequent vomiting due to frequent physical abuse.
“Defendants were entrusted with the duty of protecting this vulnerable child from harm and neglect and had the chance to intervene and diligently respond to the severity of the situation and the horrific nature of the allegations,” the lawsuit reads. “However, each time, Defendants left Chayce with or returned him soon after to his abusive mother.”
Residents of Michigan began to learn of the horrors Allen faced when law enforcement and other authorities discovered Allen’s body in a freezer during a wellness check in June of 2022. Law enforcement determined Allen had been dead for months and his mother, Azuradee France, 33, was sent to prison for second-degree murder.
The system needs to be fixed, Marko told lawmakers Tuesday.
“It’s hurting the people of the state of Michigan and for many there’s no justice… and the problem is that a lot of times, the state or the individuals who we entrust to protect these children don’t act and a lot of time they don’t do anything until it’s too late,” Marko said.
The state House Child Welfare System Committee has been looking into the state health department, where Child Protective Services is housed, for weeks, evaluating current policies within the department and hearing testimony from stakeholders. For the past two weeks, Members of the Office of the Auditor General have outlined areas of concern the office found in an audit in 2018 that it says persisted in a follow up evaluation in 2024, including what the office asserts are delays in CPS opening investigations that could lead to children being left in dangerous situations.
Even with Allen’s mother serving her sentence for her crimes, justice has not been served while the systems that were of the abuse and allowed it to continue go unchecked, chair of the committee Rep. Luke Meerman (R-Coopersville) said.
“Life is sacred and any life lost is a tragedy. When life is lost after CPS has become involved in a child’s care, it’s a blight on the state and the system responsible for that child’s care,” Meerman said.
It’s heartbreaking to see vulnerable adults and children continue to suffer after CPS or Adult Protective Services doesn’t intervene, Monroe County Sheriff Troy Goodnough told lawmakers.

Goodnough recalled details of the conditions two children in his jurisdiction have been living in since 2023, in which the family was found living in a tent during the winter both in 2023 and 2024, while the kids were covered in lice and hadn’t been to school in more than a year.
“I had two grown command officers come into my office saying we’ve got to do something, we’ve got to do something. They’ve not eaten. They’ve not bathed,” Goodnough said.
Despite multiple attempts to connect the family to CPS, Goodnough said his department has not heard from CPS on the case and has relied on a local church’s services to offer help to the family. It’s not sustainable for welfare services to ignore need in the state, Goodnough said, and something needs to change.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-at-4.34.08 PM-1024x579.png,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

On a cool morning in late February, Mark Fix was up before the sun to watch the Tongue River on his ranch in southeast Montana. He was concerned that a breaching ice dam could put his cattle and property in the path of rushing water carrying plates of ice the size of a dinner table.  
He was relieved to find that only his fencing and the riverbanks were damaged; his cattle were spooked but okay, he said. Across three decades of ranching on his property about 20 miles south of Miles City, Montana, Fix, who was born in Ekalaka, has grown accustomed to contending with threats from Mother Nature, but has also noticed them intensifying and accelerating.
“As I get older, it is harder to go through all of these unique climate change deals that we get hit with,” he said. About 10 years ago, a tornado ripped through Fix’s ranch, slashing through the roofs of his barn and home. He remembers winds reaching 100 miles per hour.
“I thought, ‘What the heck? We don’t have this kind of stuff in Montana.’”
In February, Northern Plains Resource Council, the Montana-based environmental organization Fix used to chair, joined other environmental groups and two tribes in a request filed with the U.S. District Court for Wyoming to allow them to join proceedings in a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management over two resource management plans the agency issued last year. The lawsuit, however, wasn’t intended to fight the BLM’s plans, but to make sure the agency defends them.
The plans, one in its Buffalo, Wyoming office, the other in its Miles City, Montana office, directed the BLM to stop issuing new coal mining leases in the Powder River Basin, a mineral-rich formation straddling southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming.

The Northern Plains Resource Council was concerned that, with President Donald Trump back in the White House, the agency would not defend its resource management plans in court. It was joined by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, whose reservation lies atop the formation in southeast Montana, a group of environmental activists from the Navajo Nation, which holds mineral rights in the basin, and other environmental groups who shared that concern.
Then, in April, Trump signed an executive order aimed at rejuvenating U.S. coal, which has been hemorrhaging jobs and revenue for decades as mining has become more efficient, and utilities have switched to cheaper ways of generating electricity, like natural gas and, increasingly, even-cheaper wind and solar. Trump directed the Secretary of the Interior to prioritize coal leasing as “the primary land use for the public lands with coal resources,” required federal agencies to consider “revising or rescinding” federal actions that would transition the nation away from coal and signed a proclamation loosening air pollution restrictions for coal-fired power plants.
Coal mining appeared poised to make a comeback in the Powder River Basin.
A BLM spokesperson said in an email that the agency “is currently in the process of reviewing these resource management plans, as directed by relevant Executive and Secretarial orders,” and added in a separate email that “the BLM is committed to supporting the Trump administration’s prioritization of responsible energy development to make life more affordable for every American family while showing the world the power of America’s natural resources and innovation.”
Yet, burning coal is one of the most expensive ways of generating electricity, behind only nuclear energy and gas-fired “peaker plants,” according to one estimate.
“We’ll continue to try and defend these plans until, essentially, they no longer exist.”Melissa Hornbein, Western Environmental Law Center
The Trump administration is “seeking to undo [the two resource management plans] and they want to promulgate a new decision consistent” with Trump’s energy policy, said Melissa Hornbein, an attorney for the Western Environmental Law Center, which is representing several of the parties seeking to intervene in the Montana and Wyoming suit. Since Trump was sworn in in January, Hornbein said the federal government has been filing motions to stay cases that would require the Trump administration to defend policies enacted when Biden was president, which could happen in the effort to preserve the BLM’s Buffalo and Miles City resource management plans. 
“We’ll continue to try and defend these plans until, essentially, they no longer exist,” she said.
Wyoming is confident those plans will be replaced. In early March, state house lawmaker Scott Heiner, representing parts of Lincoln, Sweetwater and Uinta counties in southwest Wyoming, told Cowboy State Daily that Wyoming was beginning to study building a new “coal-fired plant” using $10 million in state-taxpayer dollars to help fund a yet-to-be-announced project.

“With the new administration, I think they will overturn that [resource management plan] in Buffalo,” the BLM field office that halted new coal leases in northeast Wyoming, “and I think there will be more opportunities to mine coal here in Wyoming,” he told Inside Climate News. Under Trump, Heiner sees “a chance to revitalize coal mining.”
The Powder River Basin, where mining companies report billions in annual revenue and hundreds of millions in profit, produces 41% of U.S. coal, according to Energy Information Administration data from 2022. For decades, while coal from the Powder River Basin was shipped across the U.S. as fuel for electricity plants, communities in Northeastern Wyoming benefited from the industry’s tax revenue. 
But, the tensions between coal’s local benefits and its costliness, dirtiness and production of greenhouse gases warming the climate means it faces an uncertain future, even under the auspices of a friendly Trump administration, leading some communities in the region to begin trying to diversify their economy beyond the thermal coal industry.
Still, for many on the ground, that future still includes mining coal.
Defending ‘good decisions’
Environmentalists and native groups who want to see the latest BLM resource management plans remain in place say that the environmental harms that come from mining and burning coal disqualify its continued extraction. 
“For over 100 years we’ve been affected by different types of resource extraction on our land,” said Robyn Jackson, executive director with Diné C.A.R.E, an environmental nonprofit located in the southwest’s four-corners region within the Navajo Nation. Jackson, who is Diné, the tribal name for Navajo people, said any benefits from mineral extraction — typically from the Navajo leasing land to companies — pale in comparison to “the cumulative impact of that to our air, our water, our land and the public health.”
Even though Jackson does not live near the Powder River Basin, she is worried about the Navajo footprint there. Navajo Transitional Energy Company, an energy company whose sole shareholder is the Navajo Nation, has three coal mines in the Powder River Basin, whose coal spreads below the Crow and Northern Cheyenne reservations in Montana. 
“​​We’re disappointed in the direction [NTEC is] taking of more fossil fuel development, of not limiting their carbon emissions — and especially with coal that does not seem to be a long-term source of revenue for our tribe” as demand for it continues to fall worldwide, Jackson said. “They need to be addressing the climate crisis, not emitting more carbon emissions, not emitting more greenhouse gases. And, really, they should be finding other sources of revenue that are going to be sustainable in the long term.”
The notion that one tribe could be detrimentally affecting another is part of the reason Diné C.A.R.E. has moved to defend the BLM’s decision to stop issuing future coal leases. NTEC’s operations in the basin are “exploitative towards other tribes and impacts their ancestral traditional lands, traditional cultural properties,” Jackson said.
The Northern Cheyenne, the Crow tribe and NTEC did not return interview requests.

Facing headwinds, Wyoming coal industry ‘cautiously optimistic’ about Trump administration 



Fix, the Montana rancher, is concerned that more coal mining will continue to worsen the effects of climate change, and he called the BLM’s decision to stop issuing new leases in the region “common sense” in a press release announcing the motion to intervene.
“This coal will probably never be developed because we’re going to renewables,” he said. “We got better ways to do things now than coal.”
While renewable energy has grown significantly in market share, natural gas has been the primary culprit for coal’s declining demand over the last decade.
If the Trump administration moves to stay the case or begins issuing new resource management plans in Miles City and Buffalo, a time-consuming endeavor, the environmental and tribal groups plan to continue fighting new coal mine leases.
“There were some good decisions that happened in the prior administration and we can’t let that go,” Jackson said.
A Mining Rebirth?
There are some in the region who hope to see coal mining continue, even if it’s never used to generate electricity. The current BLM management plans are “not good plans for us,” said Rusty Bell, director of Gillette’s office of economic transformation, who is working on diversifying the region’s economy. Bell said that Campbell County had received a grant from the Economic Development Administration under President Biden to build the Wyoming Innovation Center in Gillette, which researches ways to use coal for commercially viable products, like bricks, instead of using it as fuel to generate electricity. Ending mining in the Powder River Basin contradicts that effort, Bell said.
“Why would they, you know, allow us to do research on our resource, and then tell us we can’t use our resource?” asked Bell. “It doesn’t make sense.”
Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association, agreed with Bell. “We have to have access to our coal resource, and we have to have access to our resource far into the future,” he said.
Fix doesn’t want Powder River Basin coal mined for uses besides combustion. “A lot of our aquifers are in that coal,” he said. Mining removes water from the subsurface, limiting ranchers’ ability to water their cattle nearby. “It doesn’t matter what you develop it for, you still end up taking the water away.”
Deti estimated that current mining operations in the basin will cover the demand for its coal for the next 15 years, but almost all of that supply is already spoken for. New mining would pave the way for another coal plant to come online in Wyoming.
“It’s a pretty exciting time for the coal industry,” he said.
“Trump came in and gave carte blanche authority to the big coal corporations and said ‘the heck with all the little guys—all the guys working the land trying to make a living.’”Mark Fix, Montana rancher
Such a facility would be the first new coal-fired plant built in the U.S. in over a decade, and would be the first in Wyoming to include carbon capture, potentially increasing the cost to consumers, but providing a new, marketable resource — carbon dioxide.
“CO2 is valuable, and it can be used,” Deti said. He pointed to “enhanced oil recovery,” whereby a company injects CO2 underground to stimulate an oilfield’s production, as such an example.
Deti said he does not necessarily believe carbon dioxide is contributing to climate change, but if limiting CO2 in electricity production is where the market is heading, “there’s no reason you can’t do it” to continue digging up and burning coal, he said. 
Fix does not share Deti’s optimism. 
“Trump came in and gave carte blanche authority to the big coal corporations and said ‘the heck with all the little guys — all the guys working the land trying to make a living,’” Fix said. “Corporate America gets a bye, and the rest of us are going to have a hell of a time.”
He worries that more mining in the area will drive multi-generational ranchers off the land, but found some solace in the tricky economics of coal, which may keep mining companies from opening up new pits in the Powder River Basin. And he had a message for Trump and federal land managers who want more coal mining in the Powder River Basin. 
“Stop giving handouts to the corporate coal mines,” he said. “Don’t just take care of your rich friends. Take care of everyone.”

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy took questions from lawmakers on the Assembly Corrections Committee Tuesday, explaining the plan for Gov. Tony Evers’ about $500 million state budget request. 
Hoy previously defended the proposal to the Joint Finance Committee prior to which co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) had expressed concerns that the plan lacked detail.
About $325 million in Evers’ proposal would go to overhaul the state’s correctional facilities through a “domino” plan — starting with work to close Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls, which were initially supposed to close in 2021 under 2018 Act 185, and culminating in the closure of the Green Bay Correctional Institution. 
“There are a lot of issues with running facilities that are that old,” Hoy said about the Green Bay facility, which was built in 1898. It would cost about $6.3 million for the closure. “We shouldn’t be running prisons in that manner in 2025… We want to do more with our population than what those facilities can afford us to do.”
Under the plan, Waupun Correctional Institution would be closed temporarily for renovations, including replacing the existing cells with modern housing for 600 medium-security beds and establishing space for a “vocational village.” The work on Waupun would cost about $245.3 million and be ready to open in 2031.
“If we are going to keep Waupun open, we are going to completely flip the script. We are going to rewrite the narrative of Waupun,” Hoy said.
Hoy said that the idea wouldn’t be far from turning the Waupun facility into a “college campus” where inmates can receive vocational, career and technical education. 
“They’re living in community together. They’re going to school together. They’re studying in the evenings together, and it’s predicated on robust partnerships with the community so that we have manufacturers out in the community who come in to do the training on site,” Hoy said. 
Other infrastructure funding would include $130 million to complete construction of a Type 1 youth facility in Dane County, which would be necessary to close Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake schools, $9 million to convert Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake into a 500-bed facility for men, $8.8 million to convert Stanley Correctional Institution to a maximum-security institution and $56 million to expand Sanger B. Powers Correctional Center by 200 beds.
Committee Chair Rep. Dean Kaufert (R-Neenah) asked how DOC considered future budgets and whether there would be increases to the cost.
“It’s not the full cost of capital and programming for the future, so there’s a cost that is going to be harder to quantify when you build this, and you get it up and running,” Kaufert said.
Hoy said that closing Green Bay would actually represent a significant decrease in operating budget and updating Waupun would also lead to some decreases.
“Operating Waupun is quite cost prohibitive because [of] the number of staff that you need to run those aging facilities,” Hoy said. “Running a smaller facility at Waupun…requires less staffing, as well as shutting down Green Bay, your overall operating budget starts to offset [needing] more staff at Sanger Powers [Correctional Center]” to help with the additional beds.
Hoy also addressed some of the policy changes meant to address the growing prison population. Wisconsin’s prison population as of February was 23,074 and is expected to grow to 24,000 by the end of the biennium, despite the state only having capacity to house 17,638 people across its correctional facilities.
“About a third of our entire population is nonviolent in our prisons, and so we have existing programs that help people get the treatment, get the support and get them back out the door in a timely manner,” Hoy said. “One of the main mechanisms we have to do that at our disposal is the earned release program.” 
Evers’ plan would expand access to the state’s Earned Release Program to allow an additional 2,500 participants. The plan would expand access to workforce training and substance use treatment for people who have 48 months or less left in their sentences for nonviolent offenses  to support this. 
Rep. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison) asked if the state is hitting a “tipping point” when it comes to its prison population. 
“Are we at the point of even thinking about sending people to other jails? Are we thinking about sending people out of state?” Stubbs asked. “Our incarceration numbers right now… are very high.” 
Hoys said that would be a “nuclear” option, given that it would take people away from their families and community. 
“I have no intention, no desire to send people out of state,” Hoys said, but added that “at some point our options are going to run out.” 
Hoys said DOC is leveraging jail contracts as much as it can and noted that one change that is being sought in the budget is an increase to the daily rate. Right now, he said the rate is capped at $60 a day and he wants that bumped to $80 to match the rate for federal inmates. 
“If I’m a sheriff and I’m looking at taking in-state guys versus federal guys or women for that matter, I’m going to choose the federal folks because the price tag [is] better,” Hoy said. “I want to be able to have that as a resource. Again, I’d like to keep everybody in our facilities as opposed to county jails, but that is a safety valve for us that we currently do utilize.” 
Kaufert, who was newly elected to his seat in November, noted that during his previous tenure in the state Legislature in the 1990s, lawmakers on the corrections committee toured facilities in other states where Wisconsin inmates were being held.
“I don’t want to make that mistake again,” Kaufert said. 
Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere) asked whether DOC would at least consider building a new facility to replace the Green Bay one. He added that he recently spoke to the Brown County sheriff, who said there are hundreds of people at home on ankle bracelets because there just isn’t enough space. 
“I want to commend the governor for acknowledging that that needs to go away — GBCI,” Franklin said. 
“We definitely did look… but to just replace Green Bay [maximum] facility — same size, same number of beds — you’re approaching a billion dollars, if not more,” Hoy said, adding that the state  also got an estimate of about $800 million for a smaller facility. 
“If I was looking across our population right now, and we were packed to the gills with violent offenders… I wouldn’t be saying, no, let’s not build anything. I’d be saying… we need to make sure our communities are safe and continue to house these people,” Hoy said. “But when I’m sitting on, you know, a third of 23,000 people that are non-violent… I believe it’s not only the right thing to do, but fiscally responsible to give those folks a chance in the community.” 
Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond Du Lac) asked how far up DOC is on Evers’ priority list. Noting the University of Wisconsin system budget and the public K-12 funding challenges, he said that everyone is seeking funding from the same pot of money. Wisconsin has a $4 billion budget surplus and Evers had suggested raising taxes on the wealthiest Wisconsinites. 
“I think we’re pretty close to the top, and I’m not just saying that because I’m the secretary of DOC. I mean I think it’s one of his biggest priorities,” Hoy said. 
Kaufert expressed interest in having more committee hearings with DOC about the plan. 
“There’s so many arms and legs on this that one impacts the other,” Kaufert said, adding that they could break it down to have more time to speak about all the pieces. He noted that if they are spending hundreds of millions and ending up with less beds, they better have “darn good answers” for taxpayers.

A modern Wyoming fable with a naked moral: Save all the parts.
The post A political conversation with a Mayan knife-fighter appeared first on WyoFile .","I bumped into my old friend Nicky Chiffon at the Clown’s Den south of Cheyenne the other night. We hadn’t seen each other in decades, so we had some catchin’ up to do. Back in the day, we stole horses and smuggled contraband together, so we had a bond.

Opinion

He is a strange cat, so I’ll have to explain Nicky to you. His ancestors were Mayan priests and priestesses, and they passed down to Nicky the secret rituals of human sacrifice as practiced in the Yucatan. When we first met, he was the reigning welterweight knife-fighting champion of the Caribbean.
Always a rabid Broncos fan, Nicky was heartbroken when John Elway retired, so he cloistered himself in a Maoist transgender nunnery in the Red Desert. He taught switchblade tactics to the sisters and dabbled in blackbone voodoo. He recently wore out his welcome and was 86ed from the convent for being “ideologically unsound,” hence our reunion.
We found a sticky little table in a dark corner of the strip joint and discussed the deconstructionist politics of 21st-century America as we sipped our Everclear smoothies. Nicky, an astute student of collapsed civilizations, waxed prophetic about the U. S. of A.
“You had it all, amigo. You built it up ‘til you were on top of the pyramid. And now you’re tearing it all down just because some weird rich guy is pissed off at everything. The feathered serpent god is not pleased, compadre.” Nicky sucked on his straw with hollowed cheeks, and added, “I see dark days ahead, if you don’t wake up pronto. Dark days.”
I looked nonplussed, so he continued. “Think about it, cabrón. You fought a revolution so common people could have power, and now you’re giving that power to wealthy corporations. Caramba! How stupid is that?”
That made me take a big slug from my own glass of Everclear.
“It took you 250 years to create all these magnificent democratic institutions,” he said, “and now you’re getting rid of them because they annoy the upper class. See what I mean?”
I asked Nicky for specific examples.
“Okay,” he said, rising to the task. “The U.S. is supposed to be a country that welcomes new ideas, right? Americans always say they support freedom of thought and expression.” I must have nodded in agreement, because he went on. “Then why are you allowing the government to ban books and accuse libraries of sedition, just because powerful oligarchs don’t like what’s written down? That don’t make no sense.”
I ordered another round as Nicky warmed to the subject.
“And you created the judicial branch so that you’d be governed by laws, not a king. But here you are, arresting judges just because they don’t toe a political line. What would your Founding Fathers think about that horseshit?”
Nicky’s brow sweated and veins throbbed at his temple when he said, “And you stand around like peasants when your president threatens to jail anyone who protests against him. It’s almost like you’re willing to pay extra for British tea these days.”
At that point, the jukebox began playing Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’” and the stripper slowly twirled around her pole.
“Listen, Nicky,” I said, “these are changing times. Don’t be so hard on us.”
“Times change, sí. But some things shouldn’t.” He regarded me with those obsidian Mayan eyes. “If you throw away everything that made you great, you discard your foundation. Then your civilization is built on quicksand or goat manure. If something needs fixed, then fix it. But the first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts.”
Nicky’s straw made a slurping sound as he sucked up the last of his hooch. He banged his fist on the table for more and said, “My grandpa taught me that rule. I bet yours did, too. If my ancestors, the Mayans, or even the Romans, or the Sumerians, had followed that rule, they’d still be around today. Don’t throw away the good stuff!”
We tried to drink the Clown’s Den dry that night, and in our younger days, we could have. But we have mellowed with age, Nicky Chiffon and I, so we stumbled out the door and parted with our secret handshake. Nicky limped off to his next adventure, while I stood gazing up into the dark American night.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Smart, progressive women pose a serious threat to MAGA supremacy. Just ask Elon Musk, who wasted millions of dollars in Wisconsin trying to win a seat on the state Supreme Court for MAGA candidate Brad Schimel, only to watch Susan Crawford clean Schimel’s clock.
From his first presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016, “Lock her up!” has been Donald Trump’s battle cry. Restoring the greatness of a white, male-dominated America apparently requires menacing displays of dominance over women in positions of authority. Who can forget Trump acting like a stalker, invading Clinton’s personal space and looming behind her during a 2016 debate?
On Friday, a few weeks after MAGA lost its bid to disempower the progressive female majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the Trump administration sent federal agents to arrest Hannah Dugan at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Trump’s attorney general and the man he chose to lead the FBI gleefully posted pictures of Dugan’s “perp walk” in handcuffs, crowing about this unprecedented assault on the dignity and authority of a judge and the sovereignty of local courts.
On Tuesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Dugan. “In order to uphold the public’s confidence in the courts of this state during the pendency of the criminal proceeding against Judge Dugan, we conclude, on our own motion, that it is in the public interest that she be temporarily relieved of her official duties,” the state’s highest court said in a two-page letter ordering Judge Dugan “temporarily prohibited from exercising the powers of a circuit court judge.”
It’s a perplexing decision. It didn’t arise from any complaint; the Court acted on its own. And Dugan had already been relieved of her duties while she focuses on her defense by the chief judge in Milwaukee, who assigned her calendar to other judges to cover.
Worse, the suspension gives the impression that the federal charges against Dugan are indeed serious. But that impression is not supported by the only evidence the government has produced.
The justification for Dugan’s arrest, laid out in a federal criminal complaint, is that she impeded federal law enforcement agents when she objected to ICE disrupting her court’s proceedings and ushered the man they came to arrest out a side door. The defendant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who was appearing before Dugan on a misdemeanor battery charge unrelated to his immigration status, exited into the public hallway where the agents were waiting for him. Then they followed him outside and made their arrest — unimpeded.
Fox News claimed Dugan concealed Flores-Ruiz in a jury room. But that assertion is contradicted by the sworn testimony in the government’s own criminal complaint. 
The complaint features breathlessly sexist descriptions of Dugan appearing “visibly angry” and “walking quickly,” as if that were evidence of wrongdoing. But any actual wrongdoing is hard to pinpoint.
“Whatever you think of the actual conduct the complaint alleges,” says Dean Strang, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and a long-time Wisconsin criminal defense lawyer, “there is a real question about whether there’s even arguably any federal crime here.” 
The government’s behavior, meanwhile, is “extraordinarily atypical,” for a nonviolent, nondrug charge involving someone who is not a flight risk, says Strang.
The handcuffs, the public arrest at Dugan’s workplace, the media circus — none of it was normal, or justified. Then Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel began posting pictures of Dugan in handcuffs on social media to brag about it.
“So what is it they are trying to do?” asks Strang. His conclusion: “Humiliate and terrify, not just her but every other judge in the country.”
The bigger issue here, beyond an unprecedented, public display of dominance and intimidation by the Trump administration, is that, in turning federal law enforcement into an arm of his personal, vengeance-themed reality show, Trump is running roughshod over the constitutional principle of federalism, which respects the sovereignty of the states, the integrity of the courts and public safety. Scaring defendants, witnesses and victims away from making court appearances makes it harder to administer justice and makes all of us less safe.
But you’d never know that to listen to Republican state officials, who are championing federal agents barging into courts, schools and churches, forgetting everything they ever said about local control and states’ rights. In a letter released Tuesday, Assembly Republicans led by Speaker Robin Vos sent a letter to Gov. Tony Evers, declaring “our caucus believes it is imperative that our laws reflect the need for local law enforcement to comply with these efforts.”
Republicans accuse Evers of issuing guidance to state officials that impedes federal ICE raids.
 “Unfortunately, recent events in Milwaukee have underscored the importance for our state to legislate and enforce compliance with federal immigration law,” their letter declares, citing Dugan’s arrest.
The Republicans demand that Evers rescind guidance telling state agencies that they need not answer questions, hand over files, or allow ICE to enter non-public areas without a warrant.
Capitulating to an administration that has admitted to deporting U.S. citizens and defied court orders to effect the return of a man it admits was mistakenly sent to a Salvadoran prison is a terrible idea. Big law firms that agreed to drop clients and offer free legal work to appease the Trump administration have eroded trust in the law. Authoritarian undermining of our legal system is a grave danger.
The least the most timid among us can do is insist that the federal government follow the law before caving in. That’s what Dugan did, when she asked if the agents who came to her courtroom to arrest Flores-Ruiz had a judicial warrant. They did not. Nor do they have proof that Dugan herself broke any laws.
The last thing we need right now is more capitulation to MAGA bullying. Stand strong.

Transgender and nonbinary Arkansans might have changed their names or gender information on some but not all legal documents, and state policies have made it difficult for these groups of people to obtain documents that accurately reflect who they are, advocates say. Birth certificates can be legally altered, and until this year, the federal government allowed gender-neutral information on U.S. passports.
“The government has played politics with people’s lives and upended people’s ability to accurately and properly identify themselves,” said Holly Dickson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas. “This has created much chaos and turmoil for no good reason while making life harder and more unsafe for all of us.”
Last year, the ACLU of Arkansas led a lawsuit against the DFA’s decision to stop issuing gender-neutral driver’s licenses. The case was dropped after Arkansas officials permanently adopted the new policy, which prohibits the use of an “X” to indicate someone’s gender in place of “M” or “F.”
Arkansans urge state finance department not to reverse gender-neutral driver’s license policy

Several transgender and nonbinary Arkansans, including Maggs Gallup of Little Rock, urged the finance department to maintain the previous policy, which had been in place for 14 years. Gallup said in an interview Monday that they are putting off obtaining a REAL ID in case doing so requires the state to remove the X gender marker from their driver’s license.
Hudson told lawmakers that a driver’s license is “not a platform for speech” and “not a platform for personal identity.” Gallup disagreed, saying their gender-neutral ID is important to them and putting incorrect information on an ID is “a deeply incongruent thing to do.”
“In an ideal world, it would be great to have the state and officials recognize our gender,” Gallup said. “They don’t get to determine who we are, no matter what letters we put on our IDs.”
REAL IDs began with a law passed by Congress in 2005 as a response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Instituting REAL IDs statewide “will help fight terrorism and reduce identity fraud,” according to the finance department website.
The federal Transportation Security Administration accepts passports in place of REAL IDs as identification to board a flight. Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, a well-known transgender advocate who lives in Little Rock, said last week on Facebook that she was initially denied access to a flight because she has an X on her driver’s license, but she was allowed to board after displaying her passport containing a male gender marker.
Griffin-Gracy is 78 years old and gender-nonconforming, and she was present at the 1969 Stonewall riot between LGBTQ+ people and police in New York City. In her Facebook video, she expressed disbelief that her passport was accepted even though she did not appear masculine. She also said “we the people” should “stand up and fight” President Donald Trump’s administration, which does not recognize gender-neutral IDs.
Gallup said they are also concerned about potential limits on travel, both domestic and international, with or without a REAL ID. Their teenage child is old enough to learn to drive but is putting off obtaining a learner’s permit because of potential bureaucratic obstacles due to their gender-nonconforming identity, Gallup said.
Bill regulating transgender Arkansans’ bathroom use heads to House despite public pushback

“This is just one part of a larger, really complicated network of new rules and legislation that are challenging to navigate” for transgender and nonbinary Arkansans, Gallup said.
State lawmakers and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders approved a law this month that will allow Arkansans to sue for damages if they encounter someone in a bathroom, changing room, shelter or correctional facility who does not align with the “designated sex” of the space.
The state has also enacted laws in the past few years that ban transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, require public school students to use bathrooms that match their gender assigned at birth, regulate pronoun use in schools and allow doctors who provide transgender minors’ health care to be sued for medical malpractice.

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs state’s largest income tax cut into law

The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”













It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst





Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said. That includes Idaho.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Dominated by a series of tax cuts, Idaho Legislature adjourns 2025 legislative session

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville with attorney Ben Rose, left. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The trio charged in a Tennessee political corruption case shared text messages in early 2020 complaining about the state’s failure to pay a mysterious vendor for work on lawmakers’ constituent mailers, at one point cursing the administrator in charge of handling invoices.
One text message from former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson to ex-Speaker of the House Glen Casada said, “Connie’s a bi—.” Casada responded, “Agreed!”
Smith, who pleaded guilty in the fraud and kickback case and is cooperating with federal prosecutors, was referring to now-retired Legislative Administration Director Connie Ridley, who handled payments for the state’s postage and printing program for lawmakers. Ridley held up payments because of problems with W-9 tax forms by the vendor, Phoenix Solutions, which was run by former legislative aide Cade Cothren, and Casada, testimony showed.
Smith testified she was “highly frustrated” because Ridley approved work without having the federal tax documents on hand. Eventually, Cothren sent the state a W-9 signed as “Matthew Phoenix,” one of the key documents prosecutors are using in the case to show deception by Smith, Casada and Cothren to direct business to Phoenix Solutions without state officials or lawmakers knowing who was behind the company.
Casada and Cothren had stepped down from their posts at different points in 2019 because of a racist and sexist texting scandal. Casada remained in the General Assembly but not as House speaker.

Another text displayed for the jury Tuesday showed the state had paid for work on a lawmaker’s constituent mailer but didn’t include taxes.
Smith and Cothren sent each other “incredulous” text messages and Smith added another one saying, “Quite the bullsh–.”
Smith, former chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, met with Ridley to speed up payments in February 2020 when the state owed Phoenix Solutions $34,000 for work on several Republican lawmakers’ constituent mailers, including now-former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood of Signal Mountain, Rep. Dan Howell of Cleveland, Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes of East Ridge, Rep. Dennis Powers of Jacksboro, Rep. Susan Lynn of Mt. Juliet, Rep. Bud Hulsey of Bristol, Rep. Chris Hurt of Halls, Rep. Andrew Farmer of Sevierville and Smith and Casada.
Ridley testified earlier this week she didn’t find out Phoenix Solutions was run by Cothren until May 2020 when federal authorities told her to continue processing the New Mexico-based company’s invoices.
Earlier Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson ruled that prosecutors can present evidence showing the trio wanted to expand from constituent mailers, which are paid for with tax money, to House Republican Caucus work. Defense attorneys argued that the prosecutors should be limited to evidence about the postage and printing program because it is outlined in the indictment, not an effort to tap into caucus funds.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Casada-4-29-25-004-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-04-30 06:06:12.368474

(Photo: Getty Images)Let’s talk weed! You know, pot, grass, dope, herb, skunk, ganja, reefer, maryjane, cheeba. (Cheeba?) Always on brand, Republicans at the state capitol put the bulk of their energy during the session that just wrapped pursuing craven new ways to ravage immigrant families and bully non-straight-white people. But they did manage to spare some time for the subject of cannabis, resulting in adoption of a big clunker of a new wacky baccy regulatory scheme.
The cannabis state of play in Tennessee is strange and confusing, as those who produce or partake understand but others may not fully appreciate. Ours is among the minority of states where marijuana remains wholly illegal to cultivate, distribute, or possess, even for medical purposes, with criminal penalties for violations. And yet forms of cannabis that will get you plenty stoned are readily available in several forms for perfectly legal purchase and use.
The simple story of how this came to be: The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the definition of marijuana in federal law. Hemp plants are cannabis plants with very low concentrations of THC: under 0.3% means it’s “hemp” and it’s legal everywhere, while over 0.3% makes it “marijuana,” a controlled substance in federal law. And just as hemp as a plant isn’t illegal in legislatively pot-hostile places like Tennessee, neither are its constituent compounds, like the (very small amount of) THC it contains.
Hemp industry fears slate of restrictive bills could gut industry

That led enterprising ganjapreneurs to figure out how to extract THC from low-THC hemp and embed it in the kinds of cannabis products (like edible gummies and smokable concentrates) found in states with full legalization. To avoid getting too deep in the weeds (yes I went there and I’m not proud of it) I’m omitting details around THC variations THCa, delta 8. and delta 9). The point is you can buy a gummy with 10 mg of THC in Metropolis, Illinois where recreational marijuana is legal, or you can buy a 10 mg gummy in Nashville where it isn’t, and both will do the trick. The difference is that in Tennessee the ingredients will say “hemp-derived THC.”
The Tennessee Legislature waded into this free-for-all of stoner innovation two years ago with a bill regulating the production and distribution of “hemp-derived cannabinoids.” With bipartisan support, the 2023 measure created licensing, testing, labeling, and selling requirements for hemp-derived products, spelled out criminal offenses for violations, and put in place a tax on sales to fund enforcement. Sure sounds like regulation, right?
Yet just two years later GOP lawmakers said we have unregulated recreational pot, so they wrote this year’s big do-over bill adding new regulations, levying new taxes, and shifting enforcement of the whole shebang to a different part of state government. Most significantly, it narrows the definition of hemp-derived products in ways that may force the industry to abandon some offerings (until they figure out how to innovate around it).
In Senate committee testimony back in February, two hemp-related business owners said the bill will “wipe out” their industry. Looking at the specifics of the bill and the composition of their products I’d say “wipe out the industry” is a tad hyperbolic, but hempsters are not wrong to call the bill a recklessly crafted threat to a growing industry that contributes meaningfully to the state’s agricultural (and jamband) economy.
The backers of this year’s bill blended reefer madness tactics with puzzling non sequiturs to justify their crackdown. “I think the public does believe that small children should not be taking this,” Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, freely associated with the committee last month. Apropos of who-the-hell-knows-what, Briggs lamented on the Senate floor ahead of final passage that the pot was much mellower at Woodstock compared to what you find now in Nashville. On the House side, sponsor Rep. William Lamberth, a Portland Republican,) declared that “what we do with these products can change lives for the better or worse significantly.” I have no idea what that means.

The arguments for keeping Tennessee in the column of retrograde states afraid of adult recreational pot may be murky, but there is clarity in public opinion on the other side. A Vanderbilt poll in late 2024 shows Tennessee voters favoring legalization for recreational use by almost two to one (a 63-36% margin), including majorities of both Republicans (53%) and Democrats (78%). Back in 2018 support for recreational access was just 37% in an MTSU poll, so Tennesseans have come a long way on this issue as they have watched other states legalize.
The Tennessee state house is practiced at legislating against majority preferences, a relevant option when an issue stretches tensions between individual rights and collective will. But legal pot is not that sort of issue—there are no relevant rights in play (other than the right to not consume cannabis, which needs no protection).
Tennessee is hardly the first state where elected lawmakers resist treating their adult citizens like adults on this issue. Of the more than two-dozen states that have legalized recreational weed, many got it done by going around their legislatures to legalize it through voter ballot initiative. There is little doubt that would work here as well — except for the pesky little fact that Tennessee’s constitution allows no citizen-activated ballot initiatives ever on any subject. So instead we’re stuck with a feckless legislature that chooses nanny-state provincialism over giving the people what they want. And what they want is to not have to drive to Metropolis, Illinois.

(Photo by ICE)Lawmakers in the North Carolina House voted Tuesday to expand requirements for county sheriffs to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a move that Republicans say closes “loopholes” in an immigration law passed last year.
The 2024 law required sheriffs to comply with ICE “detainers” — or requests to notify the agency before an undocumented immigrant is released from law enforcement’s custody, regardless of whether they are convicted.
House Bill 318 expands on that requirement, forcing sheriffs to contact ICE in cases where a person is charged with any felony, as well as high-level misdemeanors. And it requires the sheriffs to notify the agency when a detainer is about to expire.
The bill intends to root out “loopholes” that Republicans say several sheriffs have used to avoid complying with ICE — most prominently in Mecklenburg County, where the city of Charlotte is located.
“We’re closing loopholes because five or so sheriffs have refused to cooperate,” said Rep. Brian Echevarria (R-Cabarrus).
Democratic opponents to the bill called it a violation of due process.
“You cannot detain your way to public safety,” said Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake), who recounted Tuesday her experience of being stopped on the road by law enforcement and threatened with ICE detention, despite being born in the U.S.

However, they’re noticeably absent throughout the Midwest. Local community leaders in Cleveland have called on the city to create an office of gun violence prevention, stating that a permanent investment in an office would make their work more effective.

In February, 10-year-old Lorenzo Roberson, dressed in a suit and tie, spoke passionately at a town hall meeting in Cleveland. He was there to address city leaders about how he and other kids feel about safety in their neighborhoods. Most importantly, though, he was there to remember his best friend, Kaden Coleman, who was shot and killed that same month as he sat in the backseat of a car in Mount Pleasant, eight miles south of downtown Cleveland.  
“I am Kaden because his spirit now lives within me. I am Kaden because I am 10 years old, too; I get good grades, too,” Lorenzo told a mix of residents and elected officials. “Will I have a chance to survive? Will my life be cut short, too?”
Then he posed a challenge to the audience: “Will the adults in this room make sure that I have a chance to grow?” 
His call for safety in the face of rising shooting rates among young people reflects the pervasive fear among people who live in Cleveland’s most turbulent neighborhoods, including Mount Pleasant, where Lorenzo lives. Despite a recent decline in shootings across the city, a handful of neighborhoods — Central, East Cleveland, Mount Pleasant and others  — experience disproportionate levels of violence. Homicide rates in those areas range from 25 to 57 per 100,000 residents compared to places that are as low as 0 to 15. All of the struggling neighborhoods are majority Black. 
To combat the burden of shootings on those communities, local leaders and activists have worked hard for decades to fill gaps, establishing intervention and prevention programs, doing outreach work among young people, and providing mental health support to those in need. Those methods seem to have contributed to the city’s overall decline, especially in the last few years. 
But people working to tackle gun crimes in Cleveland said local groups have fallen into silos as they each vie for funding, creating a competitive, uncoordinated response that they see as inadequate for addressing the shifting crisis. A localized Office of Gun Violence Prevention, they said, would help address that isolation — and curb shootings.
“We’ve seen how successful (these types of offices) have been in other cities. I think it would make a real difference,” said Laron Douglas, the executive director of Renounce Denounce, a community-based gang intervention program that works with kids in Cleveland.
Many cities across the country have created offices of gun violence prevention over the past several years. They coordinate local initiatives, fund programs, and help drive policy changes. Since President Donald Trump eliminated the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention in his first month in office, dozens of municipalities are proposing or creating their own, but local offices are notably scarce throughout the Midwest, where gun violence rates are higher than in some of the country’s largest cities. Several states in the region, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin, have successfully established them; Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is located, is one of the few counties to host one. 
“Having one dedicated gun violence prevention office will make us more intentional. The office would be able to call a family and deploy resources effectively,” said Myesha Watkins, who runs the Cleveland Peacemakers Alliance, an anti-violence group established in 2009 among a handful of still-active community groups. “There’s too many people who don’t know where to go for gun violence prevention.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe city has a variety of official violence prevention strategies, including the Neighborhood Safety Fund to invest in community violence prevention work; Cleveland Thrive, the city’s community-based violence intervention coalition; and the Mayor’s Office of Prevention, Intervention, and Opportunity, one of several offices addressing root causes of youth violence under the mayor’s “all-of-government” approach. Cleveland has also deployed a street outreach team from the Community Relations Board to do violence intervention work, and the Neighborhood Resources and Recreational Centers are involved with providing activity space for kids. 
Those efforts are helpful, but they’re not strategic enough, said City Council Member Richard Starr, who is a native of Central and represents several neighborhoods struggling with gun violence. “They don’t have a plan right now,” Starr said, noting the city’s handful of initiatives but lack of a concrete plan for tackling gun violence or measuring its trajectory. 
According to city data, Cleveland had a firearm death rate of 45 per 100,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year full data is available, an increase from 39 in 2022. In 2024, homicides declined to 113, from 156 in 2023, according to data from the city’s police department. Still, residents warn that the data doesn’t tell the full story. 
Data is “either going to create chaos or it’s going to create hope, and depending on the narrative, it can do either or it can do both,” Watkins said. “If we’re talking about our community members, they’ll see a post that homicides are down, but they’re not feeling that when they walk outside their homes.” 
Local leaders say the encouraging numbers shouldn’t dissuade engaged citizens from creating an office of violence prevention, especially when considering the areas most affected. Michael Houser, the Cuyahoga County Council Member for District 10, which includes some of Cleveland’s most gun violence-plagued neighborhoods, including East Cleveland, Cleveland Heights, and St. Clair Superior, has been pushing the county to build an office of violence prevention since his election last year, and hopes to work in partnership with Starr at the city-level to create one. 
The County Council is in talks to create one, but the question is how they’re going to fund it. “We find money to fund everything else,” Houser said. “So hopefully we will be able to find the funding for this very important initiative.” 
In Cleveland, Council Member Starr led the effort to declare gun violence a public health crisis, legislation which passed in the city council yesterday. Starr will now be able to use state and federal resources to fund an office. “You look at some of these other cities, they have plans and investment in how they’re going to curb violence. Cleveland is behind on that,” Starr said, pointing to Columbus, one of the few Midwest cities to have such an office.
Since its municipal office was created in 2023, Columbus has achieved what Starr and others hope to. They’ve taken a public health approach to gun violence, helped coordinate and strategize violence reduction programming between different local groups, and begun to measure and assess their progress (a report is coming in the next few months). 
“Columbus is flooded with (violence intervention groups) and we needed a way to streamline these groups to make sure they’re most effective and have access to funding,” said Rena Shak, the executive director of the Office of Violence Prevention in Columbus.  
That sort of strategizing is exactly what people want to see in Cleveland. 
“We have individuals and we have groups doing great work, but we need to find a way to bring people together,” said Michelle Bell, founder of M-PAC Cleveland, which provides resources to families and friends who’ve lost loved ones to gun violence. Bell remembers feeling like there was nowhere to turn after her son was shot and killed in 2019. “If people are saying we need this office, our officials and local leaders need to listen.”

Whether you’re running a small business, managing a classroom, serving in public office or raising a family, you’ve likely seen firsthand how quickly circumstances can change. At Idaho State University, we feel it too. But rather than retreat in the face of uncertainty, or freeze in place, we’re leaning in with courage, creativity and a deep sense of responsibility to the state of Idaho and its communities. 
Nowhere is that more evident than in ISU’s L.S. Skaggs College of Pharmacy, serving Idaho for over 100 years. 
Like many professional programs nationwide, market pressures in the pharmacy industry have caused enrollment declines over the past decade. For a state like Idaho, where access to health care is already strained, this is a serious concern. 
Many pharmacy programs in the U.S. have tried to just weather the storm, unwilling to respond or adapt. At ISU, forward-thinking administrators and faculty got to work. They asked hard questions, made tough decisions and reimagined what the future could look like. They pivoted. 
For the College of Pharmacy, their strategy in the face of enrollment changes was both simple and bold: tighten the belt, focus on excellence and stay true to our mission. The college began a multi-year “step-down” budget process to right-size operations while protecting core programs and positions. They eliminated vacancies through attrition, restructured contracts and found smart ways to reduce overhead and adjust student cohort sizes. Every decision was guided by a commitment to students, principles and patients, not bureaucracy or maintaining the status quo. 
And it’s working. Through disciplined planning, ISU’s College of Pharmacy is not only financially stable, but it’s innovating and thriving in a new environment while continuing to graduate skilled professionals. 
Take, for example, their expansion of clinical psychopharmacology. This master’s degree program trains licensed psychologists to prescribe medication safely and effectively, especially in underserved areas. Today, we have 22 students enrolled from across the country, and demand continues to grow. That’s a real impact, rooted in local need and national relevance. 
Or look at our hybrid delivery model. With campuses in Pocatello, Meridian and Anchorage, Alaska, in partnership with the University of Alaska Anchorage, our faculty teach and collaborate across thousands of miles, supporting students in rural communities and building tight-knit teams that defy geographic boundaries. They’ve turned a challenge into a strength.
What we’ve learned from ISU’s College of Pharmacy applies far beyond higher education. When circumstances shift, we can’t cling to the way things used to be. We need leaders at every level who are willing to adapt, focus on purpose and move forward with faith in the future. It also requires confidence in the mission and knowing what not to sacrifice or give up in pursuit of making a positive difference. 
At Idaho State University, our purpose is clear. We exist to serve Idaho. We prepare the next generation of pharmacists, nurses, teachers, engineers and business leaders while contributing to the creative arts and producing impactful research. We provide a return on investment that benefits every community, and we do this with fewer resources than most universities of our size. 
This year, as Idahoans consider the future of education and government, I hope our story adds something meaningful to the conversation. Higher education institutions can adapt; we can pivot while being true to the most important aspects of an educational mission. At our best, we are nimble, practical and deeply committed to solving real problems and contributing to society. 
We’re not perfect. But we’re listening. We’re learning. And we’re leading. 
In uncertain times, leadership isn’t about being the loudest voice in the room. It’s about showing up, making hard, but principled decisions, and exhibiting strength through resiliency. Because perseverance in tough times doesn’t just steady the ship, it charts a better, bolder course for the future.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.


Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)NEW ORLEANS – The City Council committee voted Monday to advance an ordinance that protects sex workers from prosecution and arrest when reporting a crime and to prevent admittance of condom possession as evidence for prostitution.
All four council members at Monday’s joint meeting of the Governmental Affairs and Community Development committees — Helena Moreno, J.P. Morrell, Lesli Harris and Freddie King — voted to recommend the ordinance to the full council for final passage.
The ordinance, which was introduced by Councilmembers Lesli Harris and Helena Moreno, was added to the council’s consent agenda for its May 8 regular meeting, where it is expected to pass. Consent agenda items typically pass without debate.
During Monday’s hearing, Moreno said the ordinance was drafted in consultation with the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office and the New Orleans Police Department. Neither agency responded to Verite News’ requests for comment on the proposal.
The ordinance would codify into city law an internal NOPD policy meant to encourage victims of violent crimes to cooperate with police investigations. Under the policy, victims and witnesses that police encounter during a criminal investigation cannot be arrested for sex work-related violations.
Prostitution arrests have already drastically decreased in the city over the past several years. But NOPD enforcement priorities can be changed more easily than laws. Natalie Rupp, the executive director of the Trans Income Project, said the ordinance will protect the trans and sex worker community over the long term.
“Currently, if you are a sex worker who is working and you say, ‘I was raped’ or ‘I was robbed,’ and you just try to describe the scenario, you can be arrested for prostitution,” Rupp said before the committee meeting.
The Trans Income Project held a series of community meetings last year with trans people. Rupp said attendees expressed deep concern about being profiled for being trans and arrested for prostitution. A large share of trans women report having worked in the sex industry at some point in their lives, making the ordinance a “gay-specific issue,” said Rupp.
Those worries prompted the push for the proposed ordinance. Rupp said sex workers have no access to protective services if crimes are committed against them, an issue the ordinance would help alleviate.
“It is our firm belief that regardless of what you do for a living, you deserve the right to report a crime that occurred to you,” Rupp said. “We don’t say that because you’re a barista and you handed someone coffee, well, then, ‘What did you expect? Of course, they beat you up and stole your money.’ Like that is just a no-brainer.”
But if it passes, the law would only apply to the NOPD.
As a municipal law, the proposal would carry no authority over other law enforcement agencies operating in the city under the state’s jurisdiction. That includes Troop NOLA, the permanent contingent of Louisiana State Police troopers deployed to New Orleans last year under orders from Gov. Jeff Landry — with enthusiastic support from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell.
Moreno, the City Council’s vice president and a likely frontrunner in this fall’s mayoral election, did not respond to questions about how sex workers would be affected by the State Police presence in the city.
“I only have authority over local government,” Moreno wrote. “The ordinance as written can provide more clarity on how the state allows local municipalities discretion to handle certain offenses.”
Ordinance does not cover Troop NOLA
It’s not clear how Troop NOLA will respond to the ordinance should it pass. Asked whether Troop NOLA would follow the municipal code when policing in the city, State Police spokesperson Kate Stegall only noted that the troop follows only state law.
“Louisiana State Troopers are responsible for enforcing state laws across the state,” Stegall wrote in an email. “Local municipal ordinances are enforced by the police department within that specific jurisdiction.”
As Verite News reported last October, there is no formal public agreement between city and state governments about how Troop NOLA should be deployed.
Troop NOLA’s actions have sometimes been opposed to directives of local leadership, most notably in the days leading up to a series of Taylor Swift concerts at the Superdome last October, when state troopers abruptly cleared a number of homeless encampments over the objections of the city government. Troop NOLA has also come under fire for repeatedly engaging in high-speed chases for minor crimes, nonviolent crimes; a tactic NOPD can only use to pursue violent suspects under a long-running federal consent decree and departmental policy.
Still, city leaders such as Cantrell and NOPD Chief Anne Kirkpatrick have largely embraced the state’s policing efforts in the city.
And although the ordinance would prevent sex workers from being prosecuted by the local government, those arrested by the state will also be prosecuted by the state under state law. Last year, Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams inked an agreement with state Attorney General Liz Murrill that allows the Attorney General’s Office to prosecute people arrested in New Orleans by State Police troopers.
Neither Williams’ nor Murill’s offices responded to requests for comment on the proposed ordinance.
Under Louisiana state law, sex workers found guilty of prostitution could face fines and jail time. If someone has prior convictions, they can be imprisoned for at least four years and be fined between $500 to $4,000.
Preserving a ‘right to safe sex’
Attorney Lauren Hall, an attorney and co-founder of Below Sea Level Aid, drafted the language of the ordinance and said she wants to see a similar one passed at the state level, which would then protect sex workers across Louisiana.
“We’re not legalizing prostitution,” Hall said. “We’re just protecting sex workers who are victims of crimes, who seek medical treatment and who go to the police for help. It prevents them from being arrested based on prostitution, and it prevents them from being prosecuted based on this alone.”
The ordinance also includes what Hall called “a right to safe sex,” which means that police cannot use condoms as evidence for prostitution. A Human Rights Watch survey from 2013 found that 26% of sex workers in New Orleans who were interviewed were harassed by police for carrying condoms and that more than half of them were trans women. More than 50% of respondents said they carried fewer condoms in fear of getting in trouble with police.
Corinne Green, a board member of the Trans Income Project who worked on the ordinance, said community members commonly brought up fear of interacting with law enforcement in meetings. Green said that trans people are also afraid of being profiled as sex workers.
“Just simple possession of condoms as evidence of prostitution was a huge issue and really impacted people’s willingness to interact with law enforcement and also their experiences when they did,” Green said.
The ordinance drew inspiration from Louisiana’s revamped “Good Samaritan Law,” which protects people experiencing drug-related overdoses from arrest, prosecution and penalization, Green said.
Dozens of community members and organizers spoke in favor of the ordinance during public comment.
“Everyone has the right to protect themselves,” said Deon Haywood, the executive director of the nonprofit women’s rights group Women with a Vision, during public comment at the committee meeting. She has worked on behalf of sex workers for more than 35 years. “Every single person has a right to carry what they need to, and it should not be at the police discretion because someone is carrying condoms.”

Hepp pleaded no contest.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
In June, Hepp was charged in Maier’s death. Maier’s mother sued Wisconsin Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy, Hepp and others Monday, seeking compensatory and punitive damages. 
The lawsuit alleges that the defendants’ “lack of accommodation, deliberate indifference, and negligence in ignoring his rapidly and obviously deteriorating physical and mental health while he was in their care” caused Maier’s death. 
In June, the Examiner reported that Hepp and eight members of his staff had been charged with crimes related to the treatment of people incarcerated in the prison. Six staff members were charged along with Hepp in the death of Maier, who authorities said died due to dehydration and malnutrition, the Examiner reported in June. Seven incarcerated people have died at WCI since 2023, the Associated Press reported. 
A statement in a criminal complaint said Hepp didn’t oversee his staff to make sure they followed all policies/procedures. 
“Randall Hepp did not follow through the requirements of his position required by law as the staff at WCI are poorly trained on many policies and procedures regarding missed meal(s), water restrictions, medication refusals, round checks, and more,” the complaint stated. 
DA, Maier lawsuit tell different stories about Hepp
Earlier in the case, Hepp was charged with felony misconduct in public office. Penalties for a Class I felony are a fine up to $10,000 or up to three and a half years’ imprisonment, or both.

Hepp was convicted of violating law governing state or county institutions. The Class C misdemeanor comes with a fine up to $500 and up to 30 days imprisonment, or both. Hepp was not sentenced to imprisonment.
The Associated Press reported that Dodge County Circuit Court Judge Martin De Vries cited Hepp’s service record, lack of a criminal record and “‘subpar employees’” who failed to follow policy. 
Dodge County District Attorney Andrea Will lowered the charge to a misdemeanor in exchange for a no contest plea, the AP reported. Will told De Vries that she lowered the charge because Hepp was well respected within the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and didn’t know guards weren’t following policy, according to the AP. 
De Vries said the criminal charge against Hepp was “‘to some extent…symbolic,” the Post-Crescent reported. 
According to the Associated Press, Maier’s mother, Jeannette Maier, called Hepp’s sentence a “‘slap on the wrist.’” She said her son had been treated worse than a caged animal.  
“Nothing can bring my son back but I like to think we as a society would at least learn something from this tragedy so it never happens to someone else’s son,” she said in a statement, according to the AP.  
The lawsuit from Jeannette Maier alleges Hepp was aware of a “systemic lapse in enforcement” of the hunger strike and water shut-off protocols. It alleges that Hepp did not take action to attempt to make sure that the protocols were followed. 
The lawsuit also says Hepp was deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk regarding the most at-risk incarcerated people in the restricted housing unit. 
The risk, as described by the lawsuit, was that they were not receiving the level of care and supervision needed in order to afford them adequate medical and mental health evaluation and treatment and did not have humane conditions of confinement.  
This risk was created by understaffing, low morale and lack of adequate training, the lawsuit alleges. 
Sheriff supports conviction
Dodge County Sheriff Dale Schmidt released a statement on Facebook in support of the settlement and conviction. 
“I can understand why some may feel additional sanctions are warranted, but our court system must be blind to ‘feelings’ and ‘agendas’ and decisions made solely on the facts of the case,” Schmidt said. 
Schmidt said that “investigating and arresting Randall Hepp was one of the most difficult cases I have been part of, leading to some of the most difficult decisions I have had to make during my time as sheriff.” He said Gov. Tony Evers and then-Department of Corrections Secretary Kevin Carr put Hepp in a very difficult position. 
“Don’t get me wrong, he was the warden and was by law administratively responsible for Waupun Correctional Institution, and as a result, two deaths that occurred,” Schmidt said. “While we explored it, no Wisconsin or federal law directly tied back to his bosses, who failed to provide adequate resources or leadership.”
A sentencing memorandum by an attorney for Hepp said the former warden “was chosen to run Waupun because of his history of building great work environments and teams, creating positive institution culture and improving operations.” 
According to the memorandum, “Waupun Correctional was known to be the most challenging institution for correctional officers to work.”
“This institution was in complete [dysfunction], there was an extreme understaffing of uniformed positions and no goal to improve the staffing,” the memorandum stated. “There was a historically high vacancy rate that existed over a lengthy period of time that required officers to work an extremely unheard-of number of forced shifts further aggravating an already difficult situation and burning out among staff members. This situation contributed to the staff’s concerning level of apathy, distraction and a desire to transfer to other institutions.”
The memorandum said Hepp “became the primary and recurring voice” for the need to improve staffing at Waupun.
“Unfortunately, his voice was not heard,” the memorandum stated. 
“Many pieces to this puzzle” have not yet gone through the criminal justice system, Schmidt said, since cases are still being processed through the courts. 
One former Waupun employee pleaded no contest in September and was fined $250. Charges were dismissed against another, and other cases are pending, the Associated Press reported.
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Hepp’s conviction on Tuesday afternoon.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)A statement that denies the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is compiling an autism registry, but says instead that it is creating a sweeping database of existing health records, has done little to quell fears among autism advocates.
Last week, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya announced that his office would draw on an unprecedented array of public and private records to establish a “disease registry” centralizing information on autistic people’s prescription drug use, insurance claims, Medicare and Medicaid records, genetic and lab tests and even data from smartwatches.
In response to the strong pushback that followed, the department attempted to walk back the announcement — and blame the media for the furor.
“The original narrative incorrectly suggested that HHS was creating an autism registry to track individuals using personal data,” the department said in a statement to The 74. “This is not accurate. The NIH is developing a secure data repository that will allow researchers to analyze large-scale, de-identified data. The director did not misspeak; rather, the term ‘registry’ was misused by the media, implying an unethical method of data collection.”
However, using video of the NIH announcement, the fact-checking site Snopes was able to establish that the original reporting was accurate.
Bhattacharya’s initiative followed a promise by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that by September, new research sponsored by his department would identify an environmental toxin responsible for what he called an autism epidemic. That theory contradicts mainstream science that links autism to genes and the increasing number of diagnoses to better testing — particularly in low-income households and among children of color.
Though many autistic children are able to prepare for college and a career when given the proper supports, “These are kids who will never pay taxes,” Kennedy said. “They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”
To head the study, Kennedy appointed a man cited by Maryland officials for practicing medicine without a license. David Geier was also found to have improperly prescribed puberty blockers for autistic children and administered a harmful drug used to treat lead poisoning that is not approved for use in the U.S.
Given Kennedy’s public proclamations, advocates said they would take a wait-and-see stance to the announcement that the new database would not contain a registry.
“This is positive news, but given this administration’s previous actions and comments, particularly those related to autism over the last several weeks, we are not assuming that there is no longer anything to worry about,” leaders of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network said in a statement. “Given everything this administration is saying and doing about autism, privacy and public health, we have every reason to distrust this initiative under current leadership at HHS.”

The word “registry” is particularly polarizing to disability advocates, who note that such lists — which still exist in some U.S. states — were used to identify autistic children who were killed in Nazi Germany’s experimental “euthanasia clinics,” as well as people to be sterilized and institutionalized in the United States.
“ ‘Registry’ and ‘data collection’ can mean many things,” the network said, adding that if advocates had been included in discussions about the proposed research, they could have asked for clarity: “Under previous administrations led by both Democrats and Republicans, we and other organizations had direct lines of communication with autism policy experts inside HHS.”
Several days before the NIH announcement was reported, four dozen organizations that advocate for autistic people issued a rare collective statement criticizing Kennedy’s repeated, disproven claims about a condition many scientists agree is a naturally occurring neurotype.
“We are deeply concerned by growing public rhetoric and policy decisions,” said the letter. “Claims that autism is ‘preventable’ [are] not supported by scientific consensus and perpetuate stigma. Language framing autism as a ‘chronic disease,’ a ‘childhood disease’ or ‘epidemic’ distorts public understanding and undermines respect for autistic people.”

Proposal to Create Federal Autism Registry Stokes Fear in Disability Advocates

 




Unknown is whether the NIH plan will indeed merge records that contain sensitive personal details with datasets that don’t include people’s identifying information. “HHS will … spend tens of millions of dollars linking existing federal databases,” the trade publication Behavioral Health Business reported, attributing the information to a department statement. “The National Institutes of Health (NIH) working to partner with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies to create ‘a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy.’ ”
In its statement to The 74, the department said the dataset being assembled “would be fully compliant with these laws and regulations to protect Americans’ sensitive health information.”
“Data science can advance our understanding of biomedical and behavioral phenomena and contribute to breakthroughs that improve health by mining large sources of data, such as databases and datasets, for information,” said the statement. “Researchers can use techniques like machine learning and AI in data science to help analyze data and make predictions about health outcomes and disease incidence.”
As of press time, more than 150 researchers belonging to the recently formed Coalition of Autism Scientists had signed a letter calling on HHS and NIH to observe rigorous standards. Kennedy’s controversial dismissal of mainstream beliefs that better diagnosis is a major factor behind the rise in autism rates, and his plans to find, within a few months, an environmental toxin that causes autism, have caused mistrust, they wrote.
“We were deeply troubled to hear [Kennedy] dismiss past research, downplay the causal role of genes and portray autistic people in ways that counter our experiences and demean their value to society,” the letter says.
Among other measures, researchers urged Kennedy to pre-register the protocol for any planned study. This voluntary practice — creating a time-stamped, public document outlining what the study will attempt to determine — is intended to counter what is sometimes referred to as “hypothesizing after results are known.” The scholars also want HHS’ researchers to share their data with independent analysts for verification.

To California Democratic state Sen. David Cortese, the idea of gaining Republican support for a bill to provide cash to certain residents would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.
But his proposed legislation to offer $1,000 per month to homeless youth has so far received bipartisan support in the state Senate.
“It’s being embraced,” said Cortese. “This was not even considered possible five years ago.”
Cortese is among more than 20 Democratic lawmakers from 17 states launching Legislators for a Guaranteed Income on Tuesday to advocate for programs that provide direct, regular cash payments to lower-income residents to help alleviate poverty. They join a network of more than 245 mayors and county officials who have pursued dozens of basic income pilot projects across the country.
The list includes Colorado officials: former Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, Boulder Mayor Aaron Brockett, Northglenn Mayor Meredith Leighty, former Grand Junction Mayor Anna Stout and former Erie Mayor Justin Brooks.

The LGI lawmakers want to see states play a larger role in guaranteed income programs, which aim to help residents in need by handing out no-strings-attached cash.
The concept of basic income programs took off following a 2019 experiment in Stockton, California. There, 125 individuals received $500 per month for two years, which researchers found improved their financial stability and health.
Michael Tubbs, the former Democratic mayor of Stockton and current executive chairman of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said these kinds of efforts are more important now as economic uncertainty and high prices squeeze the most vulnerable people.
“The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states,” he said. “We’re going to be organizing state officials across the country who see what we all see: that affordability is an issue, that the Trump tariffs and gross mismanagement of the economy has made the problem even worse.”
While the concept has gained traction across the country, Republican state lawmakers have pushed bills to ban basic income programs, arguing they disincentivize work.
Last year, then-state Sen. John Wiik sponsored successful legislation banning South Dakota localities from launching basic income programs. At the time, the Republican said he was worried about people growing dependent upon the government.
“So, if you get people addicted to just getting a check from the government, it’s going to be really hard to take that away,” he told Stateline.
The Denver Basic Income Project, which started in 2020, was the first and largest organization in the country to study the impact of direct cash assistance on people experiencing homelessness. It distributed more than $10.5 million to recipients, but Denver leaders withdrew support from the project last year after they said an analysis of the project “did not show a statistically significant difference in homelessness resolution between the groups that received large cash transfers and those who did not.”
Legislators for a Guaranteed Income says its 23 members have so far introduced 25 bills across 11 states.

Those include Cortese’s proposed legislation in California to create a new program to help homeless youth transition out of high school.
Eligible students would receive four monthly payments of $1,000 each beginning in May. That bill, expected to cost $40 million to $50 million, has passed through two state Senate committees.
Cortese previously advocated for a 2023 California program that was the nation’s first state-funded pilot of a basic income program targeting former foster youth. He pointed to research showing basic income programs supplement, rather than replace, the need for work. And he said growing these programs can eventually reduce costs for other social safety net programs.
“I’m so pleased to see the proliferation that we’ve seen so far,” he said. “I think that it will become ubiquitous as a way of doing things and that’s going to outlast me and my career.”
In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta said he’s still exploring details on legislation for a basic income program there.
He said pilot projects across the country have proven that people pay rent, buy groceries and invest in small businesses when they have more financial freedom.
“So, this isn’t really some big experiment,” he said. “It is a proven way to reduce poverty, improve health care, boost our local economies and really get a real return on that investment.”
Kenyatta said so-called trickle-down policies that aim to boost business interests and high earners have failed many ordinary people.
“But basic income really flips that equation on its head,” he said. “It’s not about charity. It’s about power, and about giving people the power and the resources to breathe.”

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson | Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.











I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

This is especially timely in North Carolina, since there are two bills (Senate Bill 714 and House Bill 983) in the legislature aimed at deleting the current statute that allows and provides immunity for public school personnel who “intentionally inflict pain upon the body of a student as a form of punishment” up to the point that “a student requires care beyond first aid”. (Yes, that’s right, this grisly statute is still in place and yes, this is the twenty-first century.) 
Despite no organized opposition, neither bill is likely to get even a hearing in the legislature. If you’d like the back story, please read on.
Virtually all developed countries (and a host of developing countries) prohibit the use of corporal punishment in the public schools. An exception is the United States, which leaves the issue to the states. Currently, 33 states have statutes prohibiting the practice. You already know that North Carolina, along with the entire south, still sanctions violence against public school students.
Happily, there is a Tar Heel State anomaly: Taking advantage of permission granted by the state, all 115 local school districts prohibit the use of corporal punishment, and no student has been subject to the practice since 2018! This is essentially because more than 80 studies confirm that corporal punishment does not improve academic outcomes, but IS associated with negative effects on student educational and psychological development.
Given this situation, the logical question is why is the state legislature reluctant to even consider honoring local decision-making by prohibiting corporal punishment by statute? The reason is embedded in the legislative process. While surveys of legislators indicate overwhelming support for prohibiting the practice, the process allows just a few legislators to block any bill. 
For example, the House and Senate Rules Committees, through which all bills must go, each has hundreds of bills waiting for a hearing. By rule, a bill must pass at least one chamber by the self-imposed deadline of May 8. This means most bills will die on that day, simply because the committee chair refused to give a bill a hearing. This will almost certainly be the case with the corporal punishment bills.
It is generally thought that laws reflect the norms of a society. With regard to corporal punishment in the public schools of North Carolina, this is clearly not the case. It is comforting that all local school boards and administrations have taken steps to protect students. It is disconcerting, however, that the state legislature continues to tarnish our reputation by declining to remove a statute that no longer reflects who we are.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/American-History-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-04-30 06:06:12.368474

(Mike Hawkins for KFF Health News)Adelaide Tovar, a University of Michigan scientist who researches genes related to diabetes, used to feel like an impostor in a laboratory. Tovar, 32, grew up poor and was the first in her family to graduate from high school. During her first year in college, she realized she didn’t know how to study.
But after years of studying biology and genetics, Tovar finally got proof that she belonged. Last fall, the National Institutes of Health awarded her a prestigious grant. It would fund her research and put her on track to be a university professor and eventually launch a laboratory of her own.
“I felt like receiving the award was a form of acceptance, like I had finally made it,” Tovar said. “But I think many of us now fear that this is going to poison the rest of our careers.”
Tovar is one of nearly 200 young scientists across the nation whose research and job prospects have been jeopardized by the sudden termination of the NIH’s MOSAIC grant program, one of many ended by sweeping cuts across the federal scientific agencies. The grant was created by the first Trump administration to foster a new generation of diverse scientists in biomedical research, then defunded in the second Trump administration’s ongoing purge of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
In interviews with KFF Health News, Tovar and three other grant recipients worried that the loss of funding — coupled with President Donald Trump’s crusade against diversity programs — may transform a grant that was supposed to jump-start their careers into a blemish on their résumés that could cost them the jobs and funding that make their research possible.
“We might end up blacklisted by the NIH because of having this award — for who we are,” said Erica Rodriguez, 35, a grant recipient at Columbia University who conducts brain research that could lead to a better understanding of psychiatric disorders.
“Because not only is it for people with diverse backgrounds,” she said, “but it’s for people who advocate for other people with diverse backgrounds.”

The MOSAIC program — short for “Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers” — was created in 2019 to provide early-career support to promising scientists from “underrepresented backgrounds” with a long-term goal to “enhance diversity in the biomedical research workforce,” according to NIH grant documents.
The five-year grant was awarded to scientists who have finished their doctorates and work in research laboratories at universities across the country. In the first two years, scientists generally receive $100,000 to $150,000, which is largely used to pay their salaries.
By the third year, the scientists are expected to have been hired as a professor, likely at a different university, where the grant funding helps them launch their own research lab. In the final three years of the grant, funding increases to about $250,000 a year, which is used to buy supplies and hire other young scientists to work in the lab, completing the cycle.
MOSAIC awardees were chosen using a broad definition of diversity beyond race, gender, and disability. It includes those who grew up in poor households or rural areas or were raised by parents who do not have college degrees. Many of those chosen for the grant also have a history of supporting other budding scientists from underrepresented backgrounds.
MOSAIC funds research on cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, spinal cord injuries, cochlear implants, fentanyl overdoses, stroke recovery, neurodevelopmental disorders, and more.
But in recent weeks the NIH has notified most MOSAIC recipients that the program was “terminated” and their funding will end by this summer, regardless of the years left on their grant, according to NIH emails reviewed by KFF Health News. Other awardees have received no official notification and only learned through word of mouth that their funding was canceled.
Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed in an email statement to KFF Health News that MOSAIC had been defunded. She said the grants “no longer align” with agency priorities or the president’s executive orders “eliminating wasteful, ideologically driven DEI initiatives.”
Trump signed one of those orders on his first day back in the White House, instructing the entire federal government to end programs that promoted diversity, referring to them as “shameful,” “immoral,” and an “immense public waste.”
Diversity programs have been slashed across the government, including at the NIH and other HHS agencies, which have canceled hundreds of grants worth billions of dollars since March. On April 21, the NIH issued a notice that banned recipients from receiving grants if they have DEI programs and said the agency could “recover all funds” from those that do not comply.
“At HHS, we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science – not one driven by political ideology,” Rodriguez Feliciano said. “We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again.”
Many MOSAIC scientists are focused on chronic diseases. Tovar, for example, researches specific genes that make people more susceptible to diabetes, which affects about 38 million Americans.
“We have a lot of treatments for diabetes that are great for the people that they work for,” Tovar said. “In my research, I use genetics to help find better drug targets so we can find medicines for people who don’t already have therapies that work.”
In interviews, Tovar and the other MOSAIC recipients described how the sudden loss of funding will throw research and careers into upheaval: Some postdoctoral researchers may lose their current jobs when funding runs dry in months; awardees competing for professor jobs will lose research funding that made them stronger candidates; and those already hired will have less money for salaries and supplies in their research labs.
Ashley Albright, 32, who grew up poor in rural North Carolina, is now a scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, where she studies Stentor coeruleus, a large single-celled organism with regenerative abilities. She plans to start applying for professor jobs this fall.
Albright said MOSAIC funding would have given her a “better shot at my dream,” which was to give other scientists from diverse backgrounds opportunities to work in her research lab.
“I feel crushed,” she said. “I feel like someone is stepping on half of my life. … I’ve spent the last 10 years in grad school and my postdoc working toward this so I can do science, but also help other people do science.”
Hannah Grunwald, 33, a grant recipient at Harvard who studies eyeless cave fish to better understand complex genetic traits, said one of her worst fears was that universities won’t hire MOSAIC awardees at a time when the White House is ordering schools to abandon DEI programs and withholding billions from those that do not bend to the Trump agenda.
“There has been an enormous debate in our community about what we should say on our résumés,” Grunwald said. “I just don’t know if having my grant canceled because it had to do with diversity is going to limit my ability to get funding in the future.”

The termination of MOSAIC drew quick condemnation from several scientific organizations that receive grant funding to work closely with the awarded scientists, with some calling it “short-sighted” and “a significant step backward.”
Mary Munson, president of the American Society for Cell Biology, who has mentored awardees since MOSAIC began, became choked up and covered her face with her hands as she considered the possibility the grant could end up holding them back.
“Taking this grant away now does not take away the fact that they won this competitive award. It doesn’t take away that they are amazing scientists,” Munson said. “I hope that institutions will still see that nonetheless.”
Stefano Bertuzzi, CEO of the American Society for Microbiology, which also mentors grant awardees, said the mass termination of MOSAIC and other NIH grants may have a cumulative effect that will stifle scientific innovation for decades.
Bertuzzi, who immigrated from Italy in the ’90s because of America’s robust funding for science, said scientists will not stay in or flock to a nation where research funding vanishes on a political whim.
“We are going to be losing a full generation of scientists,” Bertuzzi said. “Other countries in the world will thrive.”

HopSkipDrive, a national ridesharing company focused on “safety, equity and care,” is expanding its supplemental school transportation services to Virginia Beach — aiming to help students with complex needs get to class while creating new job opportunities for local drivers.
The company’s network of “CareDrivers” — highly vetted caregivers trained to provide transportation in communities with unique challenges, such as students experiencing homelessness, in foster care or with disabilities — has already been operating in Northern and Central Virginia, and other parts of the country. 
“Transportation should never be a barrier that keeps the student from accessing their education, and we’re committed to removing those obstacles,” said Cindy Hamilton, a spokeswoman for HopSkipDrive. “We’re really committed to removing those obstacles, and we’re glad to be able to do so now in Virginia Beach.”
The company also announced in February that wheelchair-accessible vehicles would become available in Northern Virginia, with plans to expand that offering to other cities nationwide for the 2025-26 school year. 
School districts typically arrange the service directly through the company. 
Shortly after HopSkipDrive’s establishment in 2019, Virginia began seeing its list of bus drivers dwindle following the pandemic. Some of the reasons for the decline include low pay and an increase in driver retirements. The company also found that many drivers contracted COVID-19 or left for jobs in the private sector.
The company surveyed schools nationally about the bus driver shortage and found little improvement. About 91% of respondents reported the shortages had constrained their school transportation operations, an increase from the 88% in 2022.
According to the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE), the rate of unfilled bus drivers has decreased to 8.7% this school year, compared to 13.6% during the 2021-22 school year.
CareDrivers has also provided opportunities for people living in and around partnership schools. Drivers include parents, grandparents, nurses and former teachers, to name a few.
“Caregivers who tell us they choose to drive with HopSkipDrive do so because of the flexibility it offers and the value of helping kids – or anyone who needs a little extra care – get where they need to go,” Hamilton said. 
She said applicants go through a “rigorous” 15-point certification process before driving on the platform and can earn income while creating their own schedules. They also must comply with existing state and local laws and regulations, as well as the platform’s safety features and community guidelines.
“We have designed our platform to be easy to use, enabling CareDrivers in Virginia Beach and across the state to provide safe, reliable rides for students, schools, and families when it works for their schedules,” Hamilton said.
In Virginia, leaders have taken additional steps to help students get to and from school. 
Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed into law a proposal carried by Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, to create a two-year pilot program allowing school divisions to explore alternative transportation options. Schools could partner with nearby colleges or private companies to help transport students.
The legislation states that vehicles must comply with state and federal safety regulations and undergo regular inspections. School boards would also be required to hold a public hearing before adopting the program and must submit an annual report detailing ridership, costs, and bus routes to the Virginia Department of Education.
Austin told the Mercury the bill offers another option for schools in rural areas to cut costs while ensuring students are transported efficiently.
Last summer, the VDOE also amended its school bus specifications to state, “smaller capacity fleet vehicles are some options that can be used in conjunction with customary methods to provide a flexible, efficient, and comprehensive public school pupil transportation solution.”

Advocates point to the truly significant revenue they can generate for local governments. Opponents point to data centers’ enormous energy needs, climate impacts, water use and their capacity to diminish the quality of life for residents living nearby.
Will special rate classes protect Va. residents from the costs of serving data centers?

To weigh the costs and benefits of data centers and to set the ground rules for any potential data-center development, local governments should empower members of the public with all relevant information to foster a meaningful debate. We fear, however, that the widespread use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and a larger ethic of secrecy regarding data-center development curtails this discussion and, in so doing, impairs local democracy.
In order to understand how common NDAs are between local governments and data center companies, we submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to every Virginia locality we could identify with an existing, approved, or proposed data center. We found that the vast majority – 25 out of a total of 31 localities – have NDAs. We think that this could be an underestimate because some local governments may use definitions or maneuvers to avoid disclosing this information. For instance, one county reported that officials signed an NDA with a major tech firm, but they did not retain a copy for public record.
When we began our research, we naively assumed that NDAs were narrowly drawn guarantees that local governments would not share a company’s proprietary technology or cutting-edge trade secrets. But upon reading the documents, we found that they were written much more broadly, to prohibit sharing all “business plans” and/or “non-public information.” Such  broad categories could cover almost anything, including information that relates directly to community impacts. 
While these agreements acknowledge that a local government may be required to disclose information if requested by the public, they also often call on officials to share as little as legally possible, while giving the data center company advanced notice to intervene with its legal team if it so wishes before any information is shared. In this way, NDAs are written to privilege secrecy over transparency in data center development.
Data centers approved, solar farms rejected: What is going on in rural Virginia?

There is, of course, another perspective on this topic. Local officials might argue that the use of non-disclosure agreements is both lawful and routine in many types of economic development, not just for data centers. Our response is that just because a practice is currently legal, it doesn’t mean that it should remain that way. And even if local governments frequently join confidentiality agreements, it doesn’t mean that they are in the interest of local democracy. 
For example, when one local government released two NDAs to us, it asked that we keep the information as confidential as possible out of fear that it could jeopardize its data-center projects that were in the works, but not yet publicly announced. Why would sharing this information put the deals in jeopardy? If they are in the public interest, the projects should be able to withstand scrutiny even as they develop.
Here in our hometown of Fredericksburg, the city council recently passed zoning changes to create a technology overlay district for a new data center campus. But it did not give the public enough information to effectively participate in the conversation beforehand. The city did not announce the name of the data center company until the night of the city council’s vote. The city did not share the total number of data centers that would be included in the project until the day after the vote. Members of the public knew that the project would include several data centers, but many people – including us – were surprised to learn that the project will include eight to 12 new data center buildings.
Depending upon the kind of cooling system that a data center uses, its operation may require huge amounts of water, as much as several million gallons a day. But confidentiality agreements may prevent the public from fully understanding potential impacts to our rivers and water systems. This is clearly evident in a water service agreement between Spotsylvania County and Amazon for a new data center campus, which includes a confidentiality clause that states, “for the avoidance of doubt ADS [Amazon Data Service] water usage, sewage usage, and basis of design is considered Confidential Information.”
Data center water and wastewater use should not be confidential. The wellbeing of our rivers, streams and aquifers impacts us all. But this is not just about protecting the health of our environment; it’s also about protecting our democracy.
Local democracy means more than elections. It also requires properly informing the public, nurturing meaningful discussions, and giving community members an opportunity to influence decisions that will directly impact them. By withholding important and timely information, local governments and data center companies short-circuit debate in order to arrive at predetermined outcomes. 
Democracy – some say – dies in the dark. But that is exactly where many data center deals are born and live.

(Photo courtesy AmeriCorps)Maryland was one of the lead states in a coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia that sued the Trump administration Tuesday in an effort to block its push to “dismantle” AmeriCorps, the domestic volunteer service agency.
The suit said that within the past two weeks, agency officials, at the direction of Elon Musk’s DOGE Service,  put 85% of the administrative staff on leave as well as all of the members of the National Civilian Conservation Corp, who were told their service would be terminated.
Last Thursday, the agency began sending reduction-in-force notices to all the administrative staffers who were on leave, the lawsuit said, and after hours on Friday it began notifying states that nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps programs operating in their states was being immediately terminated. That cut would affect more than 1,000 AmeriCorps programs nationwide, according to a statement Tuesday from Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown.
He said that in Maryland, Brown said, AmeriCorps had 4,949 members and provided more than $21 million last year in federal funding and education awards last year, supporting 4,949 members serving across the state. He said the Governor’s Commission on Service and Volunteerism funded 25 service programs through Americorps for everything from working with refugees or elderly residents to being in Teach for America.
“In Maryland alone, programs that educate children, care for the elderly, and rebuild homes are being wiped out overnight. I will fight this brazen abuse of power in court and do everything in my power to restore these life-changing services,” Brown said in a prepared statement on the filing of the lawsuit.
As Trump hits 100 days, Brown among attorneys general battling him at every turn

AmeriCorps has its roots in the Great Society programs of the 1960s and took its current form in 1993, as the Corporation for National and Community Service. It is a public-private partnership, in which volunteers typically spend a year of service, during which they are paid a stipend to cover basic living expenses and can receive scholarship funding at the end of their service.
Until the cuts began earlier this month, CNCS had a staff of 700 and supported more than 200,000 members, the lawsuit said.
The suit said the White House does not have the authority to eliminate the AmeriCorps program, which was authorized and funded by Congress and can only be undone by lawmakers. The sudden, DOGE-inspired cuts were unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, failed to provide sufficient public notice, and exceeded presidential powers to intrude on congressional authority, the suit said.
“The Administration is free to ask Congress to abolish AmeriCorps, but it cannot simply terminate the agency’s functions by fiat or defund the agency in defiance of administrative procedures, Congressional appropriations, and the Constitutional separation of powers,” the suit said. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ actions should be declared unlawful and vacated.”
Those charges were echoed in an April 23 letter to President Donald Trump, led by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and signed by 147 other members of Congress, including both of Maryland’s senators and four of its eigth House members: Democratic Reps. Johnny Olszewski Jr., Sarah Elfreth, Kweisi Mfume and Jamie Raskin.
The cuts to the program will “prevent the agency from continuing to deliver critical services, which include supporting veterans, fighting wildfires, tutoring in schools, combatting the fentanyl epidemic, and much more,” the letter said.
That was echoed by Gov. Wes Moore (D), who said in a statement Tuesday that the state “strongly supports the litigation to be filed by Attorney General Brown today to stand up for AmeriCorps.”
“If the federal administration wants to strengthen our country’s resolve, bridge divides, and usher in our next era of greatness, it should be expanding opportunities for Americans to serve one another,” Moore’s statement said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The lawsuit is just the most recent of dozens filed by Democratic attorneys general against the Trump administration’s lightning-fast and deep cuts to federal programs and funding, many of which have been successful at reversing or stalling those cuts. Brown has joined more than two dozen such suits, on education cuts, worker firings, transgender rights and more, and this is the second on which he has been one of the lead plaintiffs.
The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for Maryland by Brown and the attorneys general of California, Colorado and Delaware.

(Screenshot from presentation by John Culbertson, vice president of MSW Consultants)To get a better understanding of what’s in New Hampshire’s trash, workers hand-sorted more than 250 samples of garbage around the state and visually surveyed hundreds more.
Those findings will be detailed in a waste characterization study set to be released early next month, with a presentation Friday to the state’s Solid Waste Working Group offering a preview. John Culbertson, vice president of MSW Consultants, the Florida-based management consulting firm that completed the study, called it “a sort of Gallup poll of trash.”
The study focused on municipal solid waste — such as the trash residents bring to the curb — and construction and demolition debris. “Those are far and away the largest components of solid waste,” Culbertson said, with the two categories making up 952,699 annual tons, or around 87.5% of the state’s solid waste disposal, according to data cited in his presentation.
Combining the categories, the team found 41.5% of what was disposed of was not recyclable in New Hampshire. But the other trash included materials that were commonly targeted in recycling programs (14.6%), recyclable through special collection (11.5%), potentially recyclable (8.1%), and recyclable organics (24.3%), such as food waste.
The most common refuse found in municipal solid waste was unpackaged food waste (almost 12%), compostable paper (just under 8%), and packaged food waste (roughly 7%). 
“What I see is that a very significant amount of the material that we are throwing away in New Hampshire could be recycled or composted or otherwise better managed,” said Reagan Bissonnette, the executive director of the Northeast Resource Recovery Association, a recycling nonprofit, and a member of the working group.
Culbertson pointed out that recyclables sorted out of the waste were “highly contaminated” with liquid and grit, meaning some figures could be an “overstatement.” Like other statistical work, it comes with a margin of error. “Our results acknowledge that we just can’t ever get a perfect knowledge of what’s in your disposed waste stream,” he said, stressing the “nuance underneath just the reported, high-level numbers.”
This study didn’t deal with a major hot topic in the state’s waste policy discussions: the hundreds of thousands of tons of out-of-state waste that pour into New Hampshire landfills each year, which make up about half of what is dumped there. Nor did researchers venture beyond the state to analyze the composition of New Hampshire trash exports. Instead, it dealt with trash generated and deposited within the state’s borders. 
It offers insights into how the state can work to meet its diversion goals. New Hampshire has a statutory goal — but not a mandate — to reduce solid waste, in weight, by 25% by 2030 and 45% by 2050. These goals specifically target municipal solid waste and construction and demolition debris.
The preferred way to minimize that waste, as established in the state’s official waste management hierarchy, is to reduce it at its source. Then there’s recycling and reuse, composting, waste-to-energy, and incineration, in that order. Landfilling is the last resort. 
The state has taken some recent steps toward cutting down on food waste. In February, a law went into effect prohibiting “any person” generating one ton or more of food waste per week from disposing of that waste in a landfill or incinerating it, carving out exceptions if the person is farther than 20 miles from an alternative facility or if there isn’t ample capacity at such a facility. The state plans to use federal grant money for a food waste generator study to identify entities subject to the law. 
Food releases large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, when dumped in landfills, something supporters of the new law hope it will address. 
However, food waste bans have often been ineffective in diverting waste from landfills and incinerators. Out of the first five states to implement one, only Massachusetts succeeded in reducing landfill waste, a paper published in Science in September found. Researchers pointed to frequent inspections, an easy-to-understand law with few exceptions, and a strong composting network as factors likely influencing the state’s success.
The waste characterization study found a significant amount of materials commonly targeted for recycling instead ending up in the state’s landfills. Bissonnette said education is key, and also pointed to the success of pay-as-you-throw programs that exist in some New Hampshire communities. Trash tonnage in Concord, for instance, has gone down by 40% since the program was implemented in 2009, according to the city. 
The reduction was “pretty much overnight,” Bissonnette said.
“It was so dramatic that city staff called around to other towns to make sure that they weren’t suddenly seeing a flood of trash coming from Concord,” Bissonnette said. “And, no, it really was that people were thinking twice before throwing something away. We saw recycling increase.”
There are opportunities to divert more construction and demolition debris, too. Major components of this waste included wood (29%) and shingles (14.4%), according to the presentation. 
In Littleton, Bissonnette’s organization worked on a pilot program with the town that allowed for items that would typically be discarded in a construction and demolition debris container to instead be set aside for others to take home and use. That included materials like clean wood, which others could take to burn or use as building materials, or things like doors and windows. 
“It was a really significant amount of material that just within, I think it was about a month-and-a-half pilot program, they were able to divert and keep out of the landfill,” Bissonnette said. “And in that case, it was getting reused instead of recycled, which is even better.”
The study was funded through Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling, or SWIFR, funds made available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Executive Council approved a $295,500 contract for the project in December 2023. 
“A lot of our neighboring states and others have had this information profile, and we felt it would be really important to use these federal funds to get our own data,” said Michael Wimsatt, director of the Department of Environmental Services’ waste management division, at the meeting.

The bill, however, includes a significant exception. House Bill 781 would allow local governments by “majority vote” to designate local government-owned property located within its jurisdiction to be used for a “continuous period of up to one year for public camping or sleeping purposes.” Local governments can renew the one-year period.
  Rep. Brian Biggs (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph) said he sponsored the bill after leaders of local municipalities came to him looking for guidance in handling homelessness. Biggs insisted the bill doesn’t criminalize homelessness as some critics contend.
“It addresses the use of public property for camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness,” Biggs said. “It does create clear guidance. We need guidance.”
In addition to Biggs, HB 781 is cosponsored by GOP Reps. Neal Jackson, Jennifer Balkcom and Mike Schietzelt — who represent parts of Randolph, Moore, Henderson, and Wake counties.
Under the bill, counties or municipalities designating property for encampments must establish and maintain minimum standards and procedures designed to:

Ensure the safety and security of the designated property and the persons lodging or residing on the property.
Maintain sanitation, including, at a minimum, by providing access to clean and operable restrooms and running water.
Coordinate with the county health department to provide access to behavioral health services, which must include substance abuse and mental health treatment resources.
Prohibit illegal substance use and alcohol use on the designated property and enforce the prohibition against such use.

Several people signed up to speak against the bill. They were only given one minute each to speak.
Otto Harris, a pastor speaking on behalf of Ken Carter, bishop of the Western North Carolina Conference of the United Methodist Church, said HB 781 treads on the state’s most vulnerable citizens.
“How can we push down folks who are already down?” Carter asked. “Seems like it’s impossible, but this bill has figured it out.”
Harris said the bill will criminalize homelessness and place unhoused people in “harm’s way with potential penalties, fines, court dates, blemishes on their record.”
Chris Nobblitt, an organizer for Durham-based National Union of the Homeless, said the bill will lead to deaths if approved.

“This bill will kill the Hurricane Helene victims that have still not gotten help from  FEMA or the state,” Nobblitt said. “This bill will kill veterans that serve my country, please do not let this bill pass.”
Nobblitt compared “sanction encampments” to “concentration camps.”
“If you really wanted to help homeless people, then you would help to unlock the 27 empty homes for every homeless person. You would help us get Medicaid for every person,” Nobblitt said. “You would raise the minimum wage so we could afford the sky-high rent that the corporations in North Carolina are holding hostage.”
According to the N.C. Housing Coalition, there are 1.1 million families in North Carolina who are burdened by housing costs. The group’s annual County Profiles reported that 48% of renters and 19% of homeowners in North Carolina pay more than 30% of their income on housing. Families that spend more than 30% of income on housing are considered cost-burdened. In 2024, homelessness in North Carolina increased 19%, as the official count reached a total of 11,626 individuals experiencing homelessness.
Chris Sharp of the conservative, Texas-based Cicero Institute, spoke in support of the bill.
“This bill allows for local governments to establish sanctioned camping, camping areas that provide basic sanitation, access to mental health and substance abuse treatment, along with protection from gangs drug dealers, which often prey on these vulnerable individuals,” Sharp said. “HB 781 also provides for protection of individual property and small business property rights.”
Bill critics have said they believe Sharp’s group represents is behind HB 781.
“I’m also glad today that the Cicero Institute has finally revealed itself as the sponsor and lobbyist for this bill,” said Latonya Agard, executive director of the N.C. Coalition to End Homelessness.

Agard noted that the Cicero Institute was founded by billionaire venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale who she said has opposed Housing First policies that prioritizes getting people experiencing homelessness into permanent housing.
“They have provided the template for this bill in other states around the country as an opposition to Housing First, which is documented and clearly has evidence that it does work when it is funded properly,” Agard said. “This bill does not take into account the issue that there is not enough affordable housing as homelessness has increased, as the number of people who are unsheltered has increased, our affordable housing availability has decreased, and that is why we see so many people in this need.”
  Benjamin Horton (Photo: Veterans Services of the Carolinas)
Benjamin Horton, director of outreach at Veteran Services of the Carolinas, said he’s concerned about whether municipalities can keep veterans safe in such encampments. Horton also worries about being about to find veterans to provide services if the bill becomes law.
“We’re a very stubborn bunch,” the U.S. Navy veteran said. “You’re telling us where we camp, where we can’t camp. That’s going to make it harder on street outreach folks, mental health folks who are working with the VA for multiple services.”
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) said the bill doesn’t solve the problem of homelessness. Lawmakers must address low wages, mental illness and other conditions that lead to homelessness, she said.
A person making minimum wage — $7.25 per hour — and working two, 40-hour a week jobs can’t afford to pay rent, Budd said.
“You do that for two jobs, you’re at $30,160 [a year], so when we talk about solutions for homeless people, we need to not just be talking about affordable housing,” Budd said.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
Federal education cuts and Trump DEI demands leave states, teachers in limbo

In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
‘It’s the system that needs fixing’
Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law Monday.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Debate over holding back third graders roils state legislatures

The new law requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
Opposition to ‘science of reading’
Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.










A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

Gov. Ned Lamont proposed using tens of millions of those dollars to fund social services, but in its proposed budget released last week, the Appropriations Committee said this money should come from the General Fund. Even so, some Democratic leaders say they would be open to Lamont having a role in how the settlement funds are used, a major reversal that would require changing state law.
Just a few years ago, Lamont backed a law that created the Connecticut Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee (OSAC) to designate how more than $600 million in opioid funds that are expected to come to the state over an 18-year period should be spent. The law was intended to prevent lawmakers and future governors from dipping into the money to fill budget gaps like they historically did with the tobacco settlements of the 1990s.
[RELATED: Lamont wants to dip into opioid settlement to fund social services]
Lamont’s proposed budget would require changing that law so the money could be used for things like cold weather emergency response and mobile crisis care, services that were previously funded by fees, taxes and federal funds. But in the Appropriations Committee’s proposed budget for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, legislators specified that the Opioid Settlement Fund is separate, and “expenditures must be approved by the Committee and used in accordance with the controlling judgment, consent decree, or settlement.”
Lawmakers recommended continuing these services but said that the money should come from the General Fund. In some cases, they also recommended less money for services.
In a statement through a spokesperson, Attorney General William Tong said he appreciates that the funds have been restored.
“We look forward to continuing discussions about how to fund the state’s priorities consistent with the settlement language and Connecticut’s opioid settlement statute, which requires opioid funding proposals to go through an application process,” the statement reads.
John Lally, a member of OSAC who lost his son to opioid use, said he was “really surprised” when he learned that Lamont had proposed using settlement funds. 
“It goes against what he agreed to in the beginning,” Lally said. 
Lally has spent many hours over the past two years on the committee. While he said it would be frustrating to see that time go to waste, “the bigger issue is what we owe the people of Connecticut who struggle with addiction and their families.” By going through the careful process that OSAC has set up, Lally believes, the funds will be spent “in a way that will honor them and the ones we’ve lost, like my son, in the best way we can.”
After Lally learned of Lamont’s proposal, he and other members of OSAC have been calling lawmakers for their support to ensure the funds would not be diverted.
“We’re willing to fight for what we believe is right,” he said.
But not everyone on OSAC seems to agree that the process is going well, or that Lamont should be kept out of decision-making.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee and a member of OSAC, said that she doesn’t believe that the line items Lamont singled out to be funded by OSF were the right choice for how the money should be used, but she would be open to the governor and lawmakers weighing in on how that money is spent in the future if it’s carefully focused on opioid addiction and treatment.
“What we have going on right now is an overthought process (on OSAC), and I am well OK with thinking about things, but I think there has to be action along with thinking about things,” Osten said. 
Advocates have expressed frustration with the slow pace of OSAC’s decision-making and confusion over how recommendations for using the funds are being considered, especially considering the stakes of the opioid crisis. But in recent months, the group has picked up the pace: as of mid-April, the fund had received more than $158 million, of which about $93 million has already been allocated, according to Chris McClure, the chief of staff at the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, co-chair of the Public Health Committee and a member of OSAC, said that the committee should be in charge of making decisions about how the funds are used but agreed with Osten that there may be a middle ground that includes the committee while also allowing elected officials to have a say. 
“I think honoring the process is still worthwhile,” he said.

There are many factors that go into the overdose epidemic of opioids and other drugs that kill thousands of North Carolinians each year.
As a pair of law and medicine experts explained, however, in a recent NC Newsline op-ed, there are some increasingly successful strategies that deserve public support.
And topping the list is the urgent need for everyone – health care providers, law enforcement, elected officials – to recognize that substance use disorder – is just that: a medical disorder, not merely an addiction or personal weakness to be frowned upon.
Fortunately, polls show that an overwhelming majority of North Carolinians have come to understand this truth and strongly favor what experts describe as “a health-first approach” to the problem, that includes funding for non-judgmental, evidence-based treatment programs.
The bottom line: To his great credit, Governor Josh Stein has voiced strong support for committing the state to just such an approach and ending the stigma that too often attaches to substance use disorder. All state policymakers and providers should follow his lead.

With a final few tweaks, Ohio senators advanced a major piece of energy legislation.
The Senate Energy Committee vote was unanimous. With both chambers in session Wednesday, it’s likely lawmakers could sign off on the legislation and send it along to the governor.
The most substantive change had to do with the Public Utility Commission of Ohio clock — it moved from 320 days to 360. Lawmakers are putting a ceiling on PUCO deliberations because they want rate cases to move more quickly.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After Tuesday’s hearing, state Sen. Bill Reineke, R-Tiffin, connected the longer shot clock to broader changes in the ratemaking process. Utilities must come before the PUCO every three years, and they’ll be able to set rates in three-year increments with annual “true-ups” to reflect the companies’ actual balance sheet. Reineke explained the longer timeline will give regulators a bit of breathing room.
Final testimony
Before lawmakers put the bill to a vote, Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis made a final bid to remove a provision on consumer refunds. Under the changes, bill payers could receive refunds after the Supreme Court determines a charge was unwarranted, but any payments prior to that decision would be out of reach.
Willis explained her office in the middle of a case against Dayton-area AES Ohio which could yield more than $300 in refunds per customer.
“If HB 15 becomes law as written AES’s half a million consumers would lose that refund opportunity that has been in the making since 2019,” she said.
Ohio senators propose changes to harmonize House, Senate energy bills

The final version of the bill also left out a passage subjecting more power line projects to state oversight. Willis called that omission “disappointing.”
“No one is reviewing these projects,” she argued. “Not the Ohio Power Siting Board, not the PUCO and not (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). Ohio consumers, your constituents, pay 100% of those costs through transmission riders.”
Rebecca Mellino from the Nature Conservancy praised lawmakers for repealing a controversial coal subsidy approved as part of 2019’s HB 6 but argued “Ohio lags far behind neighboring states” when it comes to renewable energy. She suggested provisions encouraging brownfield redevelopment could offer an opportunity for renewable energy investment.
Bigger picture
The core incentive for new energy production is a reduction in tangible personal property taxes — levied on things like machinery and equipment. But while lawmakers attempt to boost energy production with a tax cut, they’re also trying to find reductions in property taxes.  Energy committee chairman, Sen. Brian Chavez, R-Marietta, insisted the reductions won’t undermine services.
“We’re not changing any taxes that are in effect right now,” he explained. “So any taxes from power plants that are in place will stay in place as they depreciate out — this is only on new generation.”
Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, argued the tax break is an important cue to companies. When lawmakers passed HB 6, he said, they subsidized coal and nuclear facilities.
“It was not just putting your thumb on the scale,” he said, “I mean, it wreaked havoc in natural gas generation.” With the current bill, lawmakers will remove the last of those subsidies.
“So we’ve sort of restored capitalism in the energy generation space,” Smith argued. “And by reducing the tangible personal property percentage, hopefully that sends a signal.”
Still, there’s little Ohio’s legislation can do to address lawmakers’ central concern about power demand outstripping supply. The 13-state power network PJM has a substantial backlog of power plants that want to connect to the grid, and large-scale consumers like data centers are pushing demand for power higher.
“That’s why we focused on behind the meter generation,” Chavez said, “so that any new industry that comes into Ohio is not adding additional strain on the existing grid.”
Behind the meter generation involves building a bespoke power plant directly connected to a given business.
“PJM is aware of the concerns that are out there. They’re hearing that from all 13 states,” Chavez added. “They are on our list. We’re going to go talk to them in the fall, and we’re going to have some frank conversations with them to see how we can partner to get through this.”

(Getty Images)There have been several new bills circulating in the New Hampshire Legislature regarding vaccines, among them is House Bill 679.
The bill, which passed the House in March and is now in the Senate, focuses on cutting the requirement for children to get vaccines that have not been shown to prevent transmission, or spread, of a disease. 
At first glance of this bill, one may reason: Why should they have to get a vaccine if it has not been shown to prevent disease spread? The truth is, while many immunizations do a great job at reducing spread of a disease through a population, that is not the only thing that they do. Not all vaccines prevent a person from contracting a disease. 
One of the major things vaccines do is prevent disease severity. A person who gets the influenza vaccine may still come down with the flu despite being vaccinated. However, they will be far less likely to develop severe influenza if they are vaccinated. 
In 2021, it was found that patients who were vaccinated against influenza had a 26% lower risk of ICU admission and 31% lower risk of death due to the influenza virus. Becoming vaccinated against the flu also prevents overall hospitalization rates, and in the 2019-2020 flu season, approximately 100,000 influenza-related hospitalizations were avoided due to the influenza vaccine. 
This is not only significantly beneficial for those who were vaccinated against the flu, but also for anyone else who needed a hospital bed for any reason during that flu season. Hospitals had more available space for all patients than they would have had if they were overrun by patients with influenza.
Most of the routine vaccines administered are to infants and school-aged children. This kind of legislation makes our schools less safe against preventable disease, putting students, teachers, staff, and families at risk, again not just for infection but serious infection requiring more intensive care. 
Many people are already aware of the recent measles outbreak in the U.S., which has now reached 30 states. Measles is a highly contagious virus that has been shown to manifest in 90% of close contacts of an infected patient. It typically starts with a fever as high or higher than 104 degrees, runny nose, cough, and conjunctivitis. 
After about a week, patients often develop the “classic” measles rash, which starts on the face and spreads down toward the rest of the body. In vaccinated patients, measles can be fairly mild. For unvaccinated children (i.e. school-aged children who did not get the vaccine or infants less than 1 year of age who are not yet old enough for the vaccine), measles often leads to further complications. 
The mild complications typically include ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications include pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling in the brain), hospitalization (1 in 5 unvaccinated patients who contract measles require hospitalization), and death (1 to 3 in every 1,000 children with measles). 
Complications can often also occur in adults, and particularly in pregnant patients where they have higher rates of premature delivery and low birth weight. One complication that people generally are less familiar with is called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which occurs 7 to 10 years after a child has recovered from the measles infection, and is a fatal disease of the central nervous system.
For measles, a vaccination rate in a community needs to be at least 95% to have effective “herd immunity,” or essentially to prevent a measles outbreak. Last year (2023-2024 school year), New Hampshire kindergartners had a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination rate of 89.2%, which despite sounding like quite a lot is not nearly enough to prevent spread. The state of Maine does not allow religious or personal exemptions to vaccines for schools, and their kindergartener MMR vaccination rate during the last school year was 97.2%.
As of April 24, there have already been 884 reported cases of measles in the United States. This is compared to the 285 cases reported in all of 2024, and the zero cases reported in 2000, when measles was considered fully eradicated from the U.S.
Polio, which is generally more severe in its complications and outcomes than measles, is another disease that has been eradicated from the U.S. due to immunization. By loosening the reins on vaccine requirements, we risk reintroducing our communities to these deadly and debilitating diseases.
Bad vaccination policies put New Hampshire residents at risk. As a state, we could put our country at risk. Immunizations save lives from preventable illnesses, and by declaring exemption or reducing vaccine requirements, we are not only allowing, but encouraging, the spread of disease.

(Photo by Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”
Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky, and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco, and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

(Haines Eason)Like many, I’m grappling with the fallout from the presidential election. Life being life, the election result caps a tumultuous time for me. 
My father is dying from a three-plus-year battle with myeloma. My mother needed emergency surgery to correct a health issue that flared up due to the stress of trying to care for my father on her own. I now fly home from Lawrence to Charlottesville, Virginia, as often as I can. I’m from just outside C-Ville, as it’s dubbed locally, and I’m an only child. 
Add to all this that I’m father to two boys, 6 and 4, the oldest being autistic and also diagnosed with my ADHD. 
To stay sane, I meditate, lift weights, bike as often as I can, and try to stay off my phone.
And I used to garden.
One recent, chilly spring morning, I got a wild hair: I went looking for some ancient vegetable seeds from a dusty and cobwebbed corner of the garage. They were buried under long-unused root heating mats, dry and furry peat seed starting pucks and cups, and a menagerie of bird-feeding paraphernalia.
I brought the peat pucks outside to my boys, who were wreaking havoc in the backyard. We soaked them to prepare them for seeds while we selected several varieties of tomatoes to start. The seed packets were stamped with dates in years as far back as 2018, so we started something on the order of 30. I figured most would not germinate.
We now have 30 stubbornly healthy, 104-inch tomato starts. 
Let’s just say my family and neighbors have all been notified that they’ll not need to buy tomato plants for their gardens this year.
Why garden now?
My boys are just old enough to be told to stay out of the garden beds, and actually stay out of them. They’re self-directing more — they don’t need to be underfoot and don’t need to undo whatever chore I’m doing for their devilish entertainment. They’re (kind of) sleeping through the night. There’s now a little more room — mentally, spiritually.
There’s also a dark urgency. I’ve recently bought my family approximately a month’s worth of freeze-dried food, a 20-pound bag of rice, a few cans of propane and a 3,000-watt solar generator. 
Before I decided to detox from social media and the little bit of news that trickled to me through it, the phrase “we’re on our own” seemed to crop up frequently. In this second Trump era, that may be the truth.
Every day some new agency endures firings. The fallout? Benefits slashed, services cut, support and guidance denied.
If this country — if this society — is going to make it, we’re going to have to get off our phones and out into our yards and streets with our neighbors. This is where my tomato starts come in. Most will be given away — they’ll feed my community. Having a solar generator means at least one house on the block will be able to stay connected to weather reports and radio news.
Like every urban homesteader aiming to overdo it, we also hope to buy and raise some chickens soon.
That said, wait times at online hatcheries have been quite long this year with May or June deliveries for orders placed back in March. Missouri’s Cackle Hatchery reported customers lining up before they opened for business.
On the bright side, this means others are digging in — buying and raising chickens for eggs and meat. I hope those chicken-buyers are gardening, too. I hope they’re doing so with a mind to share the bounty.
With the way things are going, I don’t know that I’ll be able to track news of any gardening or urban-homesteading revolution. I have a sense it will be harder and harder to know what’s going on with any resistance before things get better.
All I can do is be present. My family doesn’t plan to flee to Canada or Europe. This is home. Lawrence is my town. This is where we fight.
If I helped to rekindle your spirit some, great. Here are some ideas on where you might start.
If you’re eager to come down from the clouds and find a local cause, your food bank likely needs your support. Thanks in part to Trump administration scrutiny and DOGE-related efforts, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently canceled shipments of fresh food to Kansas and Missouri pantries. There’s no clear sense of when or if deliveries will resume.
Local farms also need your support. If you’d like to source more of your food from nearby and invest in your community’s food supply chain, farm-to-table advocacy organization LocalHarvest hosts a Community Supported Agriculture page that can show you which farms in our area will sell to you directly.
If you don’t have access to a yard or other city-located greenspace, a community garden may be for you. The American Community Gardening Association hosts a Find a Garden | Share a Garden page, and there are numerous ones in Kansas.
Chicken-wise, you’ll be waiting if you want to raise them for meat or eggs. The good news is there are many quality hatcheries that will ship numerous breeds directly to you.
That said, there are scammers out there (yes, even for those just wanting to purchase baby chickens). This BackYard Chickens article offers solid advice on how to separate fraud farms from reputable operations.
Best of luck, whether you garden or raise chickens or subscribe to a CSA. I hope you find the community you need and the strength to carry on.

In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon tried to fire the Department of Justice prosecutor leading an investigation into the president’s involvement in wiretapping the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters.
Since then, the DOJ has generally been run as an impartial law enforcement agency, separated from the executive office and partisan politics.
Those guardrails are now being severely tested under the Trump administration.
In February 2025, seven DOJ attorneys resigned, rather than follow orders from Attorney General Pam Bondi to dismiss corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams. Adams was indicted in September 2024, during the Biden administration, for alleged bribery and campaign finance violations.
One DOJ prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his Feb. 15 resignation letter that while he held no negative views of the Trump administration, he believed the dismissal request violated DOJ’s ethical standards.
Among more than a dozen DOJ attorneys who have recently been terminated, the DOJ fired Erez Reuveni, acting deputy chief of the department’s Office of Immigration Litigation, on April 15. Reuveni lost his job for speaking honestly to the court about the facts of an immigration case, instead of following political directives from Bondi and other superiors.
Reuveni was terminated for acknowledging in court on April 14 that the Department of Homeland Security had made an “administrative error” in deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, against court orders. DOJ leadership placed Reuveni on leave the very next day.
Bondi defended the decision, arguing that Reuveni had failed to “vigorously advocate” for the administration’s position.
I’m a legal ethics scholar, and I know that as more DOJ lawyers face choices between following political directives and upholding their profession’s ethical standards, they confront a critical question: To whom do they ultimately owe their loyalty?
Identifying the real client
All attorneys have core ethical obligations, including loyalty to clients, confidentiality and honesty to the courts. DOJ lawyers have additional professional obligations: They have a duty to seek justice, rather than merely win cases, as well as to protect constitutional rights even when inconvenient.
DOJ attorneys typically answer to multiple authorities, including the attorney general. But their highest loyalty belongs to the U.S. Constitution and justice itself.
The Supreme Court established in a 1935 case that DOJ attorneys have a special mission to ensure that “justice shall be done.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDOJ attorneys reinforce their commitment to this mission by taking an oath to uphold the Constitution when they join the department. They also have training programs, internal guidelines and a long-standing institutional culture that emphasizes their unique responsibility to pursue justice, rather than simply win cases.
This creates a professional identity that goes beyond simply carrying out the wishes of political appointees.
Playing by stricter rules
All lawyers also follow special professional rules in order to receive and maintain a license to practice law. These professional rules are established by state bar associations and supreme courts as part of the state-based licensing system for attorneys.
But the more than 10,000 attorneys at the DOJ face even tougher standards.
The McDade Amendment, passed in 1998, requires federal government lawyers to follow both the ethics rules of the state where they are licensed to practice and federal regulations. This includes rules that prohibit DOJ attorneys from participating in cases where they have personal or political relationships with involved parties, for example.
This law also explicitly subjects federal prosecutors to state bar discipline. Such discipline could range from private reprimands to suspension or even permanent disbarment, effectively ending an attorney’s legal career.
This means DOJ lawyers might have to refuse a supervisor’s orders if those directives would violate professional conduct standards – even at the risk of their jobs.
This is what Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon wrote in a Feb. 12, 2025, letter to Bondi, explaining why she could not drop the charges against Adams. Sassoon instead resigned from her position at the DOJ.
“Because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations … because I do not see any good-faith basis for the proposed position, I cannot make such arguments consistent with my duty of candor,” Sassoon wrote.
As DOJ’s own guidance states, attorneys “must satisfy themselves that their behavior comports with the applicable rules of professional conduct” regardless of what their bosses say.
Post-Watergate principles under pressure
The president nominates the attorney general, who must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
That can create the perception and even the reality that the attorney general is indebted to, and loyal to, the president. To counter that, Attorney General Griffin Bell, in 1978, spelled out three principles established after Watergate to maintain a deliberate separation between the White House and the Justice Department.
First, Bell called for procedures to prevent personal or partisan interests from influencing legal judgments.
Second, Bell said that public confidence in the department’s objectivity is essential to democracy, with DOJ serving as the “acknowledged guardian and keeper of the law.”
Third, these principles ultimately depend on DOJ lawyers committed to good judgment and integrity, even under intense political pressure. These principles apply to all employees throughout the department – including the attorney general.
Recent ethics tests
These principles face a stark test in the current political climate.
The March 2025 firing of Elizabeth Oyer, a career pardon attorney with the Justice Department, raises questions about the boundaries between political directives and professional obligations.
Oyer was fired by Bondi shortly after declining to recommend the restoration of gun rights to actor Mel Gibson, a known Donald Trump supporter. Gibson lost his gun rights after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor domestic battery charge in 2011.
Oyer initially expressed concern to her superiors about restoring Gibson’s gun rights without a sufficient background investigation, particularly given Gibson’s history of domestic violence.
When Oyer later agreed to testify before Congress in a hearing about the White House’s handling of the Justice Department, the administration initially planned to send armed U.S. Marshals officers to deliver a warning letter to her home, saying that she could not disclose records about firearms rights to lawmakers.
Oyer was away from home when she received an urgent alert that the marshals were en route to her home, where her teenage child was alone. Oyer’s attorney described this plan as “both unprecedented and completely inappropriate.”
Officials called off the marshals only after Oyer confirmed receipt of the letter via email.
Why independence matters
In my research, I found that lawyers sometimes have lapses in judgment because of the “partisan kinship,” conscious or not, they develop with clients. This partisan kinship can lead attorneys to overlook serious red flags that outsiders would easily spot.
When lawyers become too politically aligned with clients – or their superiors – their judgment suffers. They miss ethical problems and legal flaws that would otherwise be obvious. Professional distance allows attorneys to provide the highest quality legal counsel, even if that means saying “no” to powerful people.
That’s why DOJ attorneys sometimes make decisions that frustrate political objectives. When they refuse to target political opponents, when they won’t let allies off easily, or when they disclose information their superiors wanted hidden, they’re not being insubordinate.
They’re fulfilling their highest ethical duties to the Constitution and rule of law.

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)Ohio University will close the Pride Center, the Women’s Center and the Multicultural Center in response to a new higher education law banning diversity efforts that takes effect this summer, the university president announced Tuesday. 
OU will sunset the Division of Diversity and Inclusion — which includes those three centers — “over the next several weeks,” Ohio University President Lori Stewart Gonzalez said in a statement.

There is no definitive date for when the division or the centers will close, but the centers will not be open beyond when the law takes effect on June 23, according to university spokesperson Dan Pittman. 
“Work managed by the division that remains within the law will be moved to other areas of the university,” the university said. 
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced Senate Bill 1 at the end of January, it quickly passed both chambers and Gov. Mike DeWine signed it into law on March 28. Youngstown State University faculty are trying to get a referendum on the November ballot to block S.B. 1. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
The new law will also prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things.  
“We must continue to ensure every person we invite to be a part of our university community finds their place here and develops connections,” Gonzalez said in her letter to the university. “Without forgetting that essential commitment, we must also follow the law.”
All employee positions within the Division of Diversity and Inclusion will be eliminated. The three centers have eight full-time staffers, according to their websites. The centers also have student workers. 
“Employees will continue in their current roles for the next several weeks and will be given the opportunity to interview for any open university position for which they apply and meet minimum qualifications,” Gonzalez said. 
Employees who don’t continue to work at OU will receive full separation benefits, according to the university. 
Support for the university’s Templeton, Urban, Appalachian, and Margaret Boyd Scholars programs will move under the Honors Tutorial College. 
Ohio University’s Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine’s Office of Inclusion will also close because of the new law. 
The university said it will be reaching out to students, faculty and staff for their input on inclusion and belonging moving forward. 
“I want to be clear that the task ahead for all of us is not to look for ways to recreate the same approaches under a different name,” Gonzalez said. “Rather, the charge is to invent something new that meets the moment and delivers results for our students.”
The Capital Journal previously reported on how OU student Audrey Ansel has been preparing for Ohio University’s Pride Center to likely close as a result of the law. 
This comes as Ohio’s public universities are in the midst of figuring out how the controversial law affects them. The University of Toledo recently announced they are suspending nine undergraduate programs in response to S.B. 1.

Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

(Rebecca S. Gratz for Nebraska Examiner)For 35 years, the Women’s Fund of Omaha has worked on issues foundational to achieving gender equity. We advocate for public policies that ensure all women and girls can reach their full potential. Our expertise in policy advocacy includes helping to pass legislation that supports survivors of sexual violence, provides pathways to economic security and creates solutions to problems set up by systems that were never meant for us. 
Unfortunately, very few bills prioritized and championed by legislators this session support women, especially ones like Legislative Bill 89 that claim in name but fail to make any real positive impact in our lives. This so-called “Stand With Women Act” would, if it becomes law, let politicians decide who is “male” and “female” and ban a very small number transgender people from certain bathrooms and sports teams. 
Help women’s lives
While some members of the Legislature spend a lot of time saying they “stand with women” and want to “protect women,” they fail to pass policies that provide us with paid leave when we are sick or caring for our young children and aging parents. They refuse to center our right to bodily autonomy and continue to restrict access to reproductive health care, inserting themselves into our most personal decisions and stripping us of our privacy. 
They attempt to overturn our vote to raise the minimum wage, which impacts our ability to pay rent or put food on our tables. They use the weight of the government to tell us what it means to be a woman, while we’ve been living our lives all these years experiencing the ramifications of their votes.
Nebraska lawmakers could be doing so much more to support women in our state and create meaningful change in our lives. But they will fail again if they use the limited days left of this session attempting to pass legislation like LB 89 while claiming to support us. The bill will not protect us. It will not improve our lives in any measurable way. We know who perpetuates gender-based violence in our communities, and we can clearly see who and what systems are impeding our progress. 
Actions, not words
For too long, lawmakers have attempted to distract and divide our energy. The Nebraska Legislature has pretended to care about us while taking away our rights or failing to pass the policies we need to support ourselves and our families, including those we voted for directly on the ballot.
To the women of Nebraska and our allies, it’s time to remember just what and who we are fighting for: equal pay for equal work, the ability to safely raise our families, the right to decide when and if to become a parent, the privacy to make our own medical decisions, fair workplaces and communities free from violence. 
To Nebraska lawmakers: We are at a critical point in our state’s history, and in our work to protect and advance gender equity. Are you ready to pass meaningful legislation that supports all women? We are beyond ready.

(Photo courtesy Lanny Hartmann)The little-known team of 18 Maryland Department of Agriculture inspectors that typically checks equipment such as gas pumps and grocery store scales for accuracy has a new target: electric vehicle chargers.
In recent weeks, the department has begun dispatching the “weights and measures” inspectors to public EV charging stations around the state for the first time, including some inspections that were in response to customer complaints, said Alison Wilkinson, the agency’s chief of weights and measures.
It might come as a relief for EV drivers, including Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks, who said he sometimes struggles to find reliable chargers for his state-issued electric car.
“It’s become more important, obviously, as I can’t get back from someplace, because I go to three different places, and I spend an hour sitting there … And it’s not charging,” Atticks said in a recent interview.
Wilkinson said the weights and measures team won’t police chargers for their “uptime,” or how often they work for motorists, instead making sure that each charger gives an accurate accounting of the electricity it is dispensing, and charges consumers accordingly.
But if an inspector visits an inoperable charger, Wilkinson said her agency would take action, notifying the operator and requiring fixes.
“We do not oversee uptime. That does not fall under Weights and Measures authority. However, under Weights and Measures authority, it does specify that the device owner is required by Maryland law to maintain their devices in an accurate working state for the consumer,” Wilkinson said.
Already, inspectors have temporarily shut down a “handful” of EV chargers for violations, Wilkinson said, mostly for illegally charging customers by the hour, rather than by kilowatt-hour, potentially penalizing customers for slower charging.
Moore issues executive order that could delay EV sales penalties

The inspection program comes as the electric vehicle industry faces an uncertain future, with the new presidential administration reneging on support for EVs and rescinding significant funding for charging infrastructure, including the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula program, which was expected to fund dozens of chargers along highways in Maryland.
“The industry as a whole is facing strong headwinds coming out of Washington, D.C., so it does pose a question for a state like Maryland that has bold EV goals,” said Josh Cohen, head of policy for SWTCH charging company. “Is now the time to impose unwieldy regulations on chargers while the industry is still just getting off the ground?”
But some legislators say the problem is significant enough to warrant inspections.
Aside from Tesla chargers, which have a reputation for reliability, “the record is not tremendous,” said state Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County). That frustrates existing EV drivers and could stymie future purchases, all while the state is trying to encourage EV purchases to meet climate goals, she said.
“The last thing we want is for people who have made the investment in an EV to throw up their hands and go back to a gas guzzler,” Hettleman said.
She introduced Senate Bill 913, that would have codified the Agriculture Department’s authority to inspect EV chargers and called on it to develop and enforce new reliability requirements for chargers, which would have to be operational about 97% of the time. The bill failed, in part because it had a high cost of implementation during an incredibly tight year for the state budget.
But the Agriculture Department determined that it could begin inspections without a new law, using its existing authority over weights and measures. That’s because the department follows a national weights and measures policy — the National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 44 — that has already been updated to include assessments for EV chargers.
Lanny Hartmann, a Maryland EV driver and blogger focused on charging, participated in a survey of charging infrastructure around the state in late 2024 and early 2025. It found that about half of the state’s chargers were owned by electric vehicle manufacturers Tesla and Rivian, and those ports were 99% operational.
But the remaining chargers were inoperable 31% of the time, Hartmann said in testimony on Hettleman’s bill. He said many of those chargers are funded by public dollars, or were installed by electric utilities using ratepayer funds, under a program run by the Maryland Public Service Commission that is currently under evaluation.
But Hartmann said he is “not convinced that the solution is to appoint the government as the EV charging station police.” He worries that if the state places new inspection costs on charging companies, that cost would be passed onto consumers.

“Every penny that the price goes up … adds up, and there’s already been a disturbing trend of the price of public charging creeping up,” Hartmann said.
The Agriculture Department in January began registering service technicians, who install, repair and calibrate EV chargers. The registration fee is $200 per agency, $50 per technician and an additional $25 for a required test.
The department will begin requiring registrations for every consumer-facing charging device next, Wilkinson said, with regulations being drafted now that could take effect this fall or winter. She said costs of the program will be covered by annual registration fees, which haven’t been determined yet. The cost per device will depend on “the amount of time and effort that would be put into it,” the number of workers needed and the overall cost of equipment for the program, Wilkinson said.
In order to conduct the inspections, the department still needs to purchase large testing equipment known as a standard. Each machine costs more than $100,000, and the department will also need vehicles to transport them, and training for staff, Wilkinson said.
She said the department will likely need two or three more staff members to handle the EV charger inspections. The state will be aiming to visit all Maryland chargers every few years.
Inspecting EV chargers could present challenges that inspecting gas pumps don’t, Wilkinson said. Unlike gas stations, some EV charging stations are inside parking garages, meaning inspectors might have to pay just to access them.
Then, they will need to pay for the power at each station — at a gas station, inspectors can just return any fuel they pump without incurring a charge, Wilkinson said.
And slower EV chargers might be in use for hours at a time, increasing the chances that inspectors would have to leave and return later for testing.
“We have a pretty good idea how we’re going to move forward, but there will still be some hurdles to address along the way, just as there is with any new emerging technology,” Wilkinson said.
Cohen, of SWTCH, said his company supports the meter accuracy rules, but that states must enforce those rules thoughtfully, or risk placing onerous requirements on a nascent industry. He added that he hasn’t seen much evidence that there are wide-scale problems with electric meter inaccuracy on chargers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“You could potentially have chargers being tagged by a field inspector as being out of service, just based on some network glitch that is able to be remotely fixed, and then require a field inspector to go back out again to retest it,” Cohen said. “It’s all needless delays and downtime for chargers that drivers are trying to charge at.”
In mid-April, Hartmann said he found a charger in Columbia blocked off by signs stating it had been “condemned” by the Agriculture Department. This week, the charger was still closed.
When it comes to EV charger reliability, Cohen said he sees a need for “more carrots and less sticks.” He thinks that charger manufacturers have an intrinsic motivation to keep their chargers running, and compete with titans like Tesla.
“I understand that legislators are responding to constituent frustration about some chargers that don’t provide the experience that we want them to,” Cohen said. “The industry itself is evolving, and competing to improve its products and services and address those concerns.”
State legislators said they plan to return to the drawing board next year — and they have a plan for trimming the bill’s fiscal note.
This year’s bill called for a website that would publish chargers’ functionality in real time, which added a $2 million cost to the bill’s fiscal note. Hettleman said that database was “aspirational,” and may not be included when the bill is revived for the next legislative session.
Del. Nick Allen (D- Baltimore County), who sponsored a companion bill to Hettleman’s in the House, said he’s optimistic that an amended bill would pass next session, particularly given the importance of EV adoption for the state’s climate goals.
“Right now, it’s kind of a Wild West,” Allen said. “If we want to reach our goals of so many zero-emission vehicles being sold in Maryland — if we want to reach all these ambitious climate and emissions related goals, we need to make sure that when people pull off to charge their EV they have the same confidence that they do pulling into a gas station.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54484999862_1c4a1bd3c9_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 03:59:39.449697

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The good news is that the state’s schools are not going to lose $418 million in federal funding they feared was lost last month when federal officials abruptly announced they were clawing back unspent pandemic recovery funds.
The bad news is that the state could still be out $232.1 million, the Maryland Board of Education was told Tuesday.
The confusion came after school officials received a letter last month from the U.S. Department of Education, informing states that the Trump administration would cancel Biden administration extensions that would have given schools until next year to spend down any remaining COVID-19 recovery funds.
That letter, from U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, came in an email on Friday, March 28, at 5 p.m., which said the cancellation would take effect immediately. It said the federal department would consider reimbursing states, but only under narrow provisions.
“This took us off guard, needless to say at five o’clock on a Friday,” said Maryland State Superintendent Carey Wright. In the confusion, state officials estimated that as much as $418 million could be at stake for state schools.
Now, they say, the number is closer to $232.1 million.
Krishna Tullar, deputy state superintendent for the department’s Office of Finance and Operations, summarized from a chart that more than half of that amount, $144.9 million, comes from the third, and final, iteration of the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ARP ESSER, program.

The remaining $87.2 million came from earlier versions of ESSER and from other pandemic-response funds. It was slated for uses such as mental health services, professional development for teachers and for students experiencing homelessness, like residing in transitional housing.
Donna Gunning, assistant superintendent in the department’s division of financial planning, operations and strategy, said the federal government has not reimbursed the state for at least $127.5 million that has already been allocated. Another $104.6 million is money not reimbursed to the state’s local school systems.
Gunning said about $56.7 million of the school system money has been designated as “encumbered” and not spent by the school systems also called local education agencies, also known as LEAs.
Board President Joshua Michael summarized how local school districts will be affected if they are not reimbursed by the federal government for the millions they have spent.
“That could mean salaries for 2,000 teachers next year. It could mean 12,000 students in our pre-K program. We will have to come up with this money,” he said. “These are real dollars.”
Without schools being reimbursed, certain projects or educational programs must immediately stop. Board Vice President Monica Goldson said many local school systems “were counting on receiving that reimbursement in their FY ’26 budget.”
“And now they’ve been informed that they’re not. Then those cuts at the local level could be even more extreme than they are right now,” said Goldson, former CEO of Prince George’s County public schools. “I just want everybody to understand that we are falling off of the cliff quickly.”
Gunning said the state asked the federal department to reconsider its funding, but the only response received so far is that the reimbursement request for ESSER funding had to be resubmitted in another format.
Board member Rachel McCusker asked if there’s any indication when federal officials will inform the state of a decision.
“We are not aware of any state having received an approval since this decision,” Tullar said.
Because of the federal government’s decision, Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) joined other attorneys general in a lawsuit earlier this month against the federal agency to prevent it from arbitrarily changing its position so the states can continue to access the money that “provides essential support” for students.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Krishna-Tullar-4-29-2025-1024x774.jpg,,,2025-04-30 03:59:39.449697

(Photo by Jacques Julien via Getty Images)A task force is offering Maryland schools statewide guidelines on student cell phone use during school hours, but is being careful to say local systems should have the flexibility to adopt policies to their own circumstances.
Those were among the recommendations from the Task Force on Cell Phone Use in Schools, whose report was discussed Tuesday by the Maryland State Board of Education. The report suggests broad parameters — saying, for example, that restrictions should be most-stringent in lower grades, becoming more liberal as students age — but leaves the details to the state’s 24 school systems.
“So, our task force really wanted to create a guidance document and not a requirement that districts adopt certain aspects of a policy,” said Hannah Oakley, deputy director of the board and one of two facilitators on the task force. “We wanted to empower our districts to create these policies and not [create] a statewide mandate.”
At the beginning of the 2024-25 school year, school systems in the state had a range of cell phone policies, the one constant being that cell phones should be turned off during instructional time.
Cell phone use drew the attention of state lawmakers, who introduced a total of six separate bills on the topic during  this year’s General Assembly session, all of which would have required local school systems to have a cell phone policy in place.

All but one of the bills died in committee. The bill sponsored by Sen. Joanne C. Benson (D-Prince George’s) — which would have required the state Department of Education to develop guidelines for a policy “on student electronic devices during school hours” — made it to the House, which sent it back to the Senate with amendments on the last day of the legislative session, when time ran out on it.
The 17-member task force comprised of state officials, school superintendents, principals, teachers, parents and students did suggest a few requirements.
One would be for school districts to adopt a telehealth exception on cell phone use by middle and high school students with medical reasons that might require a phone, such as monitoring diabetes, or for those who have sensory or mental health needs. It recommended that those policies be in place in time for the 2025-26 school year.
In terms of student discipline, the task force said schools could follow a plan similar to one implemented in Montgomery County, which takes a graduated approach to responding to phone infractions.
The report also recommends school leaders could implement “phone-free initiatives,” incorporating a schoolwide campaign, for instance, for students to earn incentives by voluntarily turning off their phones and allowing school staff to put them away.
Cell phones as defined in the report would also include personal smart watches, headphones, laptops and tablets.
School board President Joshua Michael said he’s seeing young people wear Beats headphones “everywhere I go.”
The board took no action on the report Tuesday after a brief discussion. For the next step, Michael said the plan is for the board to turn any key recommendations into a resolution “that affirms the work of this report that we may consider as a board before moving into next school year.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2070585229-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 03:59:39.449697

Surprisingly, the most dynamic ecosystems aren’t always in Maryland or Northern Virginia but in fast-growing cities like Augusta, Georgia, and San Antonio and Austin, Texas.
In visiting these places, it is with an eye toward bringing best practices back to Maryland to accelerate our growth in a competitive national and international environment.
These cities not only have thriving commercial tech economies, but also host major federal technology centers. Augusta is home to the National Security Agency and the U.S. Army Cyber Command Center of Excellence.

It’s no coincidence that Texas ranks as the third-best business climate in the U.S., Georgia ranks fourth, and Maryland lags at 31st.
What sets these states apart is their commitment to policies that help technology firms grow. That’s why it’s alarming to see Maryland take the opposite approach by enacting a 3% sales tax on information technology and related services—the so-called Tech Tax.
While businesses understand the need for a balanced state budget, this tax directly undermines Maryland’s stated goal of leveraging our true strategic advantage – a world-class concentration of technology and cybersecurity firms. Maryland is home to over 3,300 federal contracting firms, with many ranging from traditional IT services to some of the most cutting-edge technologies in the world. Most operate as subcontractors to large businesses with prime contracts to the federal government. Because they provide services through another business, they will be directly impacted by the Tech Tax.
In a federal market where a 10% margin is considered strong, an additional 3% tax makes Maryland subcontractors less competitive, reducing their ability to reinvest, grow, and hire. This tax will not only stifle job creation but also drive firms to more business-friendly states.
Maryland’s technology companies don’t operate in isolation. They have options, and with the Tech Tax now law, recruiters from lower-cost, high-growth states will have an enticing pitch. Meanwhile, federal agencies, under increasing budget scrutiny, will look for lower-cost alternatives — putting Maryland firms at a clear disadvantage.
Over time, if Maryland firms consistently lose contracts due to higher costs, many will relocate to more dynamic states where business conditions are more favorable. This would be a devastating blow to our state’s economic future.
Gov. Wes Moore has rightly called Maryland’s technology sector a “lighthouse industry” that will guide our state’s economy forward. Yet, the Tech Tax threatens to extinguish that light, forcing federal subcontractors to move operations elsewhere.
As a longtime Marylander, I urge policymakers to reconsider the long-term consequences of these decisions. A tax that undermines our technology industry will hinder Maryland’s economic growth and cedes our competitive advantage to other states.
Let’s keep Maryland a leader in technology, not drive innovation and jobs away.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/29842821730_30908f4b88_o-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-04-30 03:59:39.449697

A new proposal to create a state infrastructure financing board could become another example.,"California’s governors and legislators have a very bad habit of enacting major programs and projects without fully exploring their downside risks.
The most spectacular example occurred in 1996, when a Republican governor, Pete Wilson, and a Democrat-controlled Legislature decided to overhaul California’s electric power industry.
The legislation was hammered out in lengthy and secret negotiations that participants dubbed the “Steve Peace death march” for the state senator who ramrodded the effort. It was enacted with only cursory public input.
As a 2003 autopsy of the ensuing disaster chronicled, “The act was hailed as a historic reform that would reward consumers with lower prices, reinvigorate California’s then-flagging economy, and provide a model for other states. Six years later, the reforms lay in ruins, overwhelmed by electricity shortages and skyrocketing prices for wholesale power. The utilities were pushed to the brink of insolvency and are only slowly regaining their financial footing. The state became the buyer of last resort, draining the general fund and committing itself to spending $42 billion more on long-term power deals that stretch over the next ten years.”
Other examples of the bad habit abound, such as beginning construction of a bullet train linking the two halves of the state with only rudimentary assumptions of its costs, ridership and other important factors — a project that limps along nearly two decades later.
Two others are the immensely costly expansion of pension benefits for public employees a couple of decades ago, which has hammered local government budgets, and big increases in unemployment insurance benefits without increasing revenues, which resulted in a $20 billion debt to the federal government that is still growing.
That brings us to Senate Bill 769, which appears superficially to be a positive effort to expand infrastructure financing but could be another example of unanticipated consequences. The measure, introduced by Sen. Anna Caballero, a Merced Democrat, would create the Golden State Infrastructure Corporation, a state-owned nonprofit company that could borrow money or issue bonds and provide financing for public or private infrastructure projects.
State Treasurer Fiona Ma is the bill’s sponsor and would appoint the corporation’s top executive, who would answer to a five-member board of elected officials and governors’ appointees.
“By partnering public and private capital, SB 769 enables critical investments in climate resilience, water systems, energy infrastructure, housing and transportation, creating jobs and future-proofing California for generations to come,” Caballero’s office contends.

 Democrat, State Senate, District 14 (Merced)



“California can’t afford to wait for Washington, or for outdated financing systems to catch up with 21st-century needs,” she said in a statement. “SB 769 is about building a resilient, modern California by creating a smarter, more flexible way to fund infrastructure that protects our communities, creates good jobs and prepares us for the challenges ahead.”
There are aspects to the proposal that should be triggering alarm bells.
There is no limit on how much debt the corporation could incur. The state would also not be liable if its financial structure collapsed. The decisions on financing private projects could be made secretly because the corporation would be exempt from some open meeting and open records laws.
The danger here is that with a potentially unlimited amount of money to be handed out with no public input, the political figures on the corporate board could be swayed to play favorites for reasons disconnected from infrastructure improvement.
We’ve seen scandals of that sort elsewhere in state government, such as in the Coastal Commission’s land use decisions and the California Public Employment Retirement System’s investments.
Without better safeguards and more sunshine, this is another scandal waiting to happen.

Getty ImagesChildhood poverty doesn’t happen by accident – it is found at the intersection of poor public policy, generational poverty, and a lack of access to essential resources. 
And while childhood poverty can’t be solved by one policy or organization alone it can be made much worse by removing one. Head Start is one of the most effective anti-poverty programs we have in the United States. Cutting it would have devastating effects on families and communities for generations to come. 
At Helping Mamas, a baby supply bank, we see every day what happens when children and families get the support they need and what happens when they don’t.
Head Start is so much more than just a preschool program. It is a family-centered program where parents receive workforce development support, health education and parenting education. Children receive quality early learning instruction closing literacy and school readiness gaps. It is a lifeline where families feel safe, loved and seen. 
Like many learning environments, Head Start Programs are often the heart of a community. Through my work with Helping Mamas I see Head Start utilizing our resources for diapers, wipes, car seats and other essential items. They became a place of safety during Hurricane Helene. They partnered with us to make sure that families in rural areas had access to essential items at their most vulnerable moments.
Head Start mobilizes the community to volunteer with children and parents. I know that when parents engage with Head Start they are getting the tools and support they need to break the cycle of generational poverty.
And I have to ask, in a time where the U.S. is consistently falling behind the world in academic achievement – particularly in math where U.S. students currently rank 28th globally – why would we cut a program that has shown to increase a child’s academic success all the way through college? 
I believe that good public policy, when paired with adequate funding, has the power to transform lives. It always has. 
And when you combine that with strong community partnerships, you’re not just supporting individual children — you’re investing in our future workforce, the long-term health of our communities, and the strength of our economy. 
Nonprofits alone cannot and should not continue to be the public safety net for our children. Overcoming educational deficits and poverty takes a combined approach of nonprofits, communities and public policy. Remove even one piece of the foundation and the structure won’t hold – collapsing along with the futures of our children.
Every dollar invested in Head Start generates up to $9 in economic returns through increased earnings, reduced reliance on public assistance and lower involvement with the criminal justice system. It also increases parental employment and reduced child maltreatment rates. 
Head Start was created as part of our country’s War on Poverty – because early childhood education, health care, and family support are not luxuries – they are necessities. Cutting Head Start doesn’t just impact our classrooms today – it threatens the future of our workforce, our economy and our country’s ability to compete on the world stage. 
So I will ask again: Can we afford the cost of cutting Head Start Programs? I don’t think so. Our children don’t think so. And if our politicians are serious about creating a better future, they shouldn’t think so either.  
This is more than a budget item, it is the future of our children and our communities. Let’s send the message that we cannot keep trying to balance a budget on the backs of our youngest most vulnerable citizens.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-30 04:01:40+00:00,CT Mirror,Don’t ban challenges to sexually explicit materials targeting minors,Brian Gedicks,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/say-no-to-authoritarian-ban-on-challenges-to-sexually-explicit-materials-targeting-minors-in-our-libraries-brian/,Two bills this session would force libraries across CT to adopt policies that restrict challenges to sexually explicit materials aimed at children.,"We have a porn problem in our culture, and it can start with exposing kids to pervasively vulgar and sexually explicit books, comic books, and graphic novels. 
Yet two bills proposed by legislators this session would force libraries across Connecticut to adopt policies that restrict challenges to sexually explicit materials aimed at children (SB1271, HB7014). Proponents claim the mantle of protecting “Huckleberry Finn” from “book banning” when they are really implementing “1984.” A closer look at the bills reveals an authoritarian attempt to intimidate parents and eliminate a transparent, locally controlled process.

Brian Gedicks
Right now, in Connecticut, no parent can remove a book from the library. According to the American Library Association, in all of 2024, only 17 books were even challenged in Connecticut – a tiny fraction of a percent in a state with over 1,000 libraries holding millions of books. 
But with these bills, one librarian can exempt large categories of books from challenge (HB7014 lines 49-66; SB1271 lines 36, 42, 62, 65) and even prevent a challenge by a board of education (SB1271(1)(1), (3), (4); HB7014(1)(d)). They also exclude most of the community from making a challenge by virtue of their childless status or whether someone else has already challenged the book, even if it was years ago (SB1271 lines 14, 15, 17, 79, 84; HB 7014(1)(4)). This is unfair, discriminatory, and antidemocratic.
The legislation would also give librarians gratuitous legal immunity (SB1271 section 1(f), 2(f)) while creating a way for them to sue parents and students for “emotional distress” (SB1271 section 1(g), 2(g)). Librarians should be learning from parents, instead of getting rattled when challenged over sexually explicit materials aimed at kids, which they chose to place in the school library. 
Why are concerned parents being targeted for prosecution when some librarians have been caught watching child pornography, even in the library? The latest case of a child librarian being charged for child pornography in Connecticut was as recent as August 2024.
“Dive deeper with your finger or a butt plug! Just make sure any objects you put up there have a flared base; otherwise, your hungry heinie can gobble it up,” advises Let’s Talk About It: The Teen’s Guide to Sex, Relationships, and Being a Human, a sexually explicit and graphically illustrated book, found in some of Connecticut’s school libraries. “I’ve never seen these in the library” claims Sen. Bob Duff. But has he looked? A quick review of the website takebacktheclassroom.com, which lists many vulgar and sexually explicit books in Connecticut school libraries, with excerpts, would educate Senator Duff about what concerned parents already know confronts their children in the local school library.
Senator Duff claims these bills “create a process.” But one does not need a law to create a process. And the proposed new processes mandated by the bills are unfair. 
Setting aside whether you think a teen should be instructed to “pay for your porn,” shouldn’t all parents and members of the community be allowed to object? The bills permit exclusion of books from challenge based on the opinion of only one librarian. The librarians could classify “Let’s Talk About It” as “sexual health” material (HB7014 lines 61-63) or “appropriate” (SB1271 lines 36, 42-46, 62, 65-66) and exempt it from any book challenge by a community member or parent (HB7014 lines 49-50; SB1271 lines 36-37, 42-43). 
It is time for concerned parents and all those who share those concerns to step up and petition their legislators to oppose these two extremist and radical bills, SB1271 and HB7014.

It can save a lot of time, provide an infinite amount of research, chat with us when no one else wants to, create outlines, press releases, and ad copy. It can rewrite our emails, structure our resumes, and in the medical community, it can provide diagnoses in record time that may result in saving lives.
In education, students like it because they can finish a homework assignment or write an essay in minutes instead of hours. And for teachers, AI can generate lesson plans and rubrics, compose quizzes, design projects, and even grade student essays and exams. Those who use it say this gives them more time to be better teachers in the classroom and that the feedback AI provides can be very similar to comments they would make. I can see why using an AI program isn’t all that different from having a teaching assistant do one’s grading, and who wouldn’t love to have a TA?
But I have some concerns.

Patrice Hamilton
First, higher education is under a microscope right now, which isn’t a bad thing because we could certainly make improvements. However, with the Department of Education being dismantled, now more than ever our society needs to believe in the importance and relevance of a college degree. 
We’re all familiar with what happened when every child who played a sport went home from the end-of-the-season banquet with a trophy. It was a well-intentioned idea, but the concept backfired because many children didn’t value the awards they received. Even at a young age, they needed to feel that they earned that ribbon or statue. What happens when college degrees are seen as another form of participation trophies? If students can get AI to write their papers, complete their math homework, fill out their lab reports, and answer their exam questions, getting a degree won’t be that big of a deal. 
Graduates need to feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with sweat and sacrifice, and professionals looking to hire should see graduation as a significant achievement as well.
Second, most of us know that one problem steroids create in sports is that if some athletes use them, this increases pressure on other athletes to use them just to stay competitive. I worry about this when it comes to education. Many students want to do their own work, and if they use AI or sources on the internet, they use them to enhance learning rather than replace it, but how will their efforts stack up against content created by an algorithm? After all, those students are only human.
I spoke with a colleague who teaches math, and they told me about a math major who had taken all of their upper-level math classes in online asynchronous courses; however, when they applied for a tutoring job, they were unable to pass a basic algebra test.
When I attend conferences, I listen to advice about what instructors can do to rewrite their assignments to discourage AI use, and yes, we should do what we can. But this puts the burden on the teacher to keep revising assignments, which is not only time-consuming, but very difficult given the way AI keeps evolving and the amount of websites that host research papers and exams keeps increasing. Of course, we could use AI to revise our exams, but this all starts to feel a bit Orwellian: AI writes paper assignments and exam questions, AI is used to respond to those assignments and exams, AI grades those papers and exams—the only thing missing is human beings. Of course, if we do use AI to grade student work, we would have to inform them of that. How will this impact students and their motivation to turn in authentic work?
As a professor, it can be dispiriting to read a batch of student work, especially when I teach an online class. With asynchronous courses, the only way I get to know my students is through their writing because I don’t have the opportunity to meet them in a classroom. 
When reading discussion posts, I used to get a sense of their personalities by their word choices, their individual examples, and their unique perspectives. Each discussion post had a different voice. Sure, the writing was flawed at times, and yes, I used to complain about wordy sentences and vague statements, but I felt that I knew my students. I miss that now. 
The other day, a colleague said, “I asked my class to write a literary analysis, and many of them turned in nearly perfect papers, but when I asked them what literary analysis is, only one student could come up with an answer.” They supposedly had done literary analyses, but they didn’t know what they had done.
There’s no such thing as a free lunch, and someday I think we will pay a price for the steroid we call AI. Someone who graduates with a college degree shouldn’t have to worry about what impression their writing will make if they can’t get a fix from an AI program.
It’s tempting to get on the AI train and see where it takes us. After all, we can’t be afraid of technological innovations. Maybe it’s not important that tomorrow’s leaders know how to write or calculate answers to problems. Maybe all they need to know is how to craft good prompts and edit the results. But I think we all can agree that they do need to know how to think, and AI is eager to do that for them as well. Should everyone who uses AI review it for errors and accuracy? Sure. Will they? Sometimes.
Another concern is whether business executives will want to pay top salaries to employees who completed their classes with the help of AI. Will those high GPAs carry the weight they used to? We all are keenly aware that graduates need substantial salaries to pay off those student loans.
I’m not suggesting we get rid of AI because the benefits it offers are important, and much like social media, we can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. We have to learn to manage both AI and social media so that they add to our lives without creating dependency. 
Artificial Intelligence needs to be regulated. We need to have clear identification of all AI created videos, text, images, and audio, and we need regulations that hold platforms responsible for hosting exams, student papers, and deepfakes. We need to require students to cite the AI they used just as they would any other human source, and we need better tools that spot AI plagiarism so that when we talk to students, we can refer to reliable evidence. 
Teachers are advised to use their intuition when it comes to student work, but this is very difficult because with programs like Grammarly, we may never get to know their authentic writing voices, and the last thing we want to do is falsely accuse a student. Many instructors have students do more of their work during class, which helps, but at the end of the day, some work has to be done outside of the classroom, and when teaching an online course, that solution is impossible to implement. 
I also think that college institutions need more limitations regarding the amount of classes a student can take online, and I would like to see more hybrid courses offered so that students are required to demonstrate their knowledge in front of an instructor once or twice during a semester. 
One major reason students choose asynchronous classes is because they offer flexibility, which is especially important to students who juggle their courses along with work and family responsibilities, but we can find a way to provide that convenience while also ensuring that students are learning what we think they are learning. I have heard that some math departments are leaning in this direction, and I hope that continues.
Social media companies like Meta and X are reducing fact-checking and putting the responsibility on the user to call out misinformation. We can’t rely on the gatekeepers of the past, which means we need a population who has information literacy skills, and we all have to protect ourselves from becoming intellectually lazy. 
People tell me that they frequently use AI at work—it saves employees time and the company money. I think that’s great, but education is a different matter. We are teaching students to not only accomplish a task, but to deepen their intellects. AI shouldn’t be a crutch and we shouldn’t let it become an addiction. I would rather read my students’ work, warts and all, then read some artificial concoction that is bulging with muscles but has no beating heart.

During the 2023-2024 academic year alone, PEN America counted over 10,000 book bans in 29 states and 220 school districts. 
Seventy-eight percent of surveyed educators said that their “students read more when they have free choice in what to read, including access to banned books,” and 81% “feel that conversations around banned books and restrictions to book access harm students.”
The data speaks for itself. Book bans have become a core facet of contemporary American politics, and continue to more forcefully occupy our collective political conscience with each passing year. 
Such censorship is a federal overreach that actively breeds illiteracy, ignorance, and intolerance. Simultaneously, these restrictions deprive states, school districts, libraries, families, and individuals of their autonomy, choice, and freedom to educate and be educated. Without protected educational rights, there is no individual and collective progression or evolution, no ability to cultivate future generations, affect global change, or resist systems of oppression. Without education, the very seats in government that create and contest bills aimed at addressing these pressing issues will not be conscientiously filled, nor their obligations dutifully fulfilled.
In order to preserve liberty, support existing educational precedents, and generate new precedents that may lead to further reform and greater literary and scholastic protections, it is necessary that the state of Connecticut show its support of civil liberties and the fundamental right to read and read freely by passing H.B. 5508: An act concerning a freedom to read.
This bill would restore agency to the state of Connecticut and its local and regional boards of education in their ability to prescribe the materials accessible in school libraries. 
Other states have already started setting legislative precedents in opposition to censorship and infringement, including California with law AB-1078 (forbids the prohibition or denial of approval of the use of instructional materials, including those in school libraries, simply for containing information about diverse groups) and Illinois with HB 2789 which became Public Act 103-0100 (holds that the State’s policy is to support and safeguard the ability of libraries and library systems to obtain materials without external restrictions, and to protect libraries and related library systems from efforts to ban, remove, or otherwise limit access to books or other resources/materials).
Beyond this data, however, I find it even more important to return to the very heart of this issue: our humanity. Ultimately, this is a matter of people, of personhood, and of the right to question and oppose, and learn and affect change. 
I remember falling in love with reading in preschool. Having access to a wide and uninhibited range of literature has helped me develop a unique identity and thought process over the course of my lifetime. Volunteering at the preschool I attended as a young child, I have seen countless other children embark on this same process of self-discovery, using these scholastic spaces and materials to self-educate and explore the world around them. I now attend Yale, speaking and engaging in political discourse, realizing and exercising my political efficacy, innately aware that so much of this opportunity has been granted to me because of the skills I developed from an expansive, inclusive, and multi-faceted education.
Participation in and resolutions of sociopolitical issues such as these require critical thinking. Critical thinking is developed through an education that begins with access. If the literature in jeopardy provides us with the developmental and social tools to question their very place in our society, it is imperative that we consider what might occur – or perhaps what might cease – in their absence.  
Without access to these materials that are now in threat of extinction, we will not have the tools to generate such discourse.
Literacy grants us knowledge. Knowledge gives us power. Power vests the next generations with the capacity to affect positive change. Ensuring this legacy begins with providing and protecting the liberty and the resources that promote a global, holistic, inclusive, productive, and universally apt education.
Discourse surrounding such controversial issues might cease to exist if we do not safeguard access to the very knowledge that assists in our development into critical thinkers and global citizens. To eliminate certain perspectives, viewpoints, and media is to effectively eliminate the ethics and integrity of education. 
If you want to protect these fundamental educational rights within the state of Connecticut, I ask that you take positive action. Show your support for this bill that currently awaits passage in the Connecticut General Assembly. Contact your local representatives. Interact with your legislators. Support school districts, libraries, and other public educational institutions in their quest to provide unmitigated access to reading materials. 
Above all, recognize the power of your voice. All of the beloved heroes and villains and protagonists and side characters from your favorite books are beloved because they had a unique voice that inspired you. They are memorable and remarkable because of the impact they made and the imprint they left. They taught you to recognize and believe in your own voice. So, out of love for them and every other person and piece of wisdom that has shaped you, protect their continued existence by using your voice now. 
Become a part of this moment in time. Become a change-agent in your present, and help to shape the future. And if you are to ban anything, work towards banning these bans.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Ahead of its vote on a bill to restrict political donations in state elections, members of the House’s multipartisan majority rejected a series of amendments that would have expanded the bill. 
Among the rejected proposals were ideas to require greater disclosure of donations funneled through so-called dark money groups enabled by the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision known as Citizens United. 
The rejected amendments, from Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, would have required prompt disclosure of donations to independent expenditure groups, required advertising disclosures, and sought to limit out-of-state contributions to groups backing ballot measures. Federal courts have struck down Alaska’s limits on out-of-state contributions to candidates.
Previous bills dealing with independent expenditures haven’t advanced to a floor vote, making the rejected amendments significant.
Inverting the usual pattern, Republican lawmakers proposed the restrictions, and they were defeated by the votes of independents and Democrats. 
Speaking on the House floor, McCabe called the lack of disclosure rules for third-party groups “a critical loophole” in state law.
Traditionally in Alaska, Republicans have supported actions to reduce limits on campaign contributions. The Republican Governors Association has repeatedly challenged disclosure rules imposed by voters in a 2020 ballot measure, and a Republican-backed lawsuit led to the elimination of Alaska’s campaign finance limits in 2022.
A ballot measure scheduled for Alaska’s 2026 elections would reimpose some limits, but if House Bill 16 becomes law, those limits would come into effect ahead of the election.
McCabe argued that HB 16 should be extended to cover independent expenditures, not just direct donations.
“Independent expenditure groups have become a big part of our political campaigns,” he said, speaking on one of his amendments.
Other lawmakers noted that most of the political mailers that filled Alaskans’ mailboxes last year were from independent expenditure groups, not politicians’ campaigns.
“Voters deserve to know who is funding the message,” McCabe said.
Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage and a sponsor of the ballot measure and HB 16, was among the lawmakers who voted against the dark-money amendments. 
“I think there is concern amongst the Alaskan public around both contribution limits and independent expenditure spending. However, the dire concern is really around the hole around campaign finance, and so to the maximum extent possible, my efforts were to try and keep the bill constrained to what was approved through the ballot measure, and to address the campaign  finance portion of this,” Schrage said.
Under the Alaska Constitution, a law can replace a ballot measure only if the underlying bill is “substantially similar” to the ballot measure.
In addition to the dark-money amendments, the House rejected a proposal to exempt most municipal elections from campaign-finance reporting requirements, and an amendment that would have prevented the recipients of state contracts — and their family members — from donating to political campaigns. 
That amendment was almost identical to a bill rejected by Hawaii’s Legislature on the same day that the Alaska House turned down the idea. Several states, including New Jersey, have so-called “pay for play” disclosure rules; the amendment proposed by Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, would have gone further by actually restricting donations.
Schrage said it went too far.
“With that specific amendment, I think my biggest concern was around the fact that family members would be prohibited from making donations to political campaigns,” Schrage said. “The courts have been pretty clear that we need to be careful about limiting people’s free speech, and thanks to Citizens United, political spending is considered free speech.”
In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission eliminated restrictions on spending by political groups unaffiliated with a particular politician. Since then, the amount of money spent by independent groups has significantly increased. So has the role of dark money contributions — money funneled through independent groups in order to conceal the identity of the donor.
A ballot measure approved by Alaska voters in 2020 requires independent groups to disclose the “true source” of their contributions, but that measure has exemptions: It doesn’t cover ballot measure groups, for example.

	Schrage said some of the rejected ideas could show up in separate legislation, but he wanted to keep HB 16 confined to the ballot measure that’s ready for a vote in 2026.
“There’s always this question of, how much do you try to do, and how much can you fit into a bill before it becomes too heavy and too controversial to make it through the process. There is a very strong desire from Alaskans to address our campaign contribution limits, and we have a very clear proposal before us. I wanted to move forward,” he said.

But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.


  Eric Wunderlin struggled for years to find stable employment due to health issues, bouncing from one minimum-wage job to another around Dayton, Ohio. He said he sometimes found it difficult to afford food for himself and his cat, Annabelle. A job program through his Medicaid health plan connected him with a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. (Maddie McGarvey for KFF Health News)
Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women and disabled people.

Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”

Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s educational savings accounts designed to help pay for public or private college expenses could expand to cover private K-12 tuition, in line with federal law, beginning in 2029.
The proposed change from State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area was amended 32-11 Tuesday evening into Legislative Bill 647 after multiple hours of debate. At least 42 states already allow such savings accounts to cover tuition at K-12 private schools, which was first allowed in 2018 after passage of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for up to $10,000 per beneficiary per year.
A 529 savings plan — in Nebraska, NEST 529 — offers tax breaks to encourage families or students to donate and allow the savings to grow tax-free. 
Multiple attempts to expand the accounts in Nebraska have stalled in recent years.
‘Great way to save’
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, who led LB 647 as chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, said he didn’t have the “foreknowledge” to use NEST 529 accounts for his children. But he “very gladly” started them for his grandchildren and suggested others do so.
“It’s a great way to save for college education, and with the implementation of this bill … those funds could also be used for primary education,” von Gillern said.

Von Gillern said that of the other states without expanded accounts — California, Oregon, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan and New York — it is “probably not a club that you would imagine Nebraska being in.”
“It sort of reminds me in grade school when they showed you pictures of five cats and a dog and said, ‘Which one doesn’t belong there?’” Sorrentino told von Gillern during the debate.
‘Subsidizing’ private school dollars
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln led opposition to Sorrentino’s measure, which he noted did not directly send public dollars to private schools. However, he and State Sen. Dunix Guereca of Omaha said it was in the same vein as the defeat of a private school voucher system last fall at the ballot box.
“We are indirectly subsidizing the tax deductions for money that goes to tuition for private K-12 education,” Dungan said of Sorrentino’s proposal, originally LB 131.

Guereca, who, along with Dungan, has been on the frontlines advocating against recent school choice proposals, said the November vote was about the “concept” of using public dollars for private schools. He said the tax breaks allowed under Sorrentino’s expanded measure could instead be used for a “plethora of other ideas,” particularly with the state’s projected budget shortfall.
“I’m afraid that if we do pass this measure then it’s a slippery slope to see more and more school privatization,” Guereca said.
Dungan raised concern that Sorrentino’s measure would not allow savings to cover K-12 public school expenses, such as for extracurriculars. Sorrentino said he was “fine” with including public schools but that doing so is not federally allowed.
Budget woes
The measure’s start date was pushed back to 2029 in part to push it beyond the state’s budget woes, not just for the next two fiscal years, at nearly $400 million in the hole with even the cuts proposed in the Appropriations Committee budget, but also following two years to mid-2028. The state would be about $700 million short of the mark future lawmakers would need to hit, based on current projections.

Sorrentino’s measure could lead to new tax breaks of about $3-4 million each year, but he cautioned that the estimate is based on assumptions of 12,000 to 15,000 people opening new accounts and meeting the maximum $10,000 contributions to those accounts.
Of 49 state senators, he said each could come up with a different estimate. He said it could be as much as $5 million or as little as $500,000. He said he thought the number was likely closer to $3 million.
State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County said Sorrentino’s measures could alleviate public school overcrowding, possibly leading to overall cost savings to the state.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln differed from her progressive colleagues and voted for the bill, as did State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, a more moderate Democrat. State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, a Republican who has rebuffed past school choice proposals, voted against adding Sorrentino’s measure to LB 647. The other votes largely followed party lines.
Conrad said Sorrentino’s measure was “intellectually and practically and policy-based distinguishable from some of the prior measures that we have looked at.”
Said Conrad: “This measure doesn’t seem to really raise the exact kind of concerns about a dilution or diminution of public funds into private schools.”

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)Humanities Montana announced Tuesday it is receiving a grant of up to $250,000 from the Mellon Foundation following news its budget was slashed as part of recent federal budget cuts.
The contribution is made up of an immediate $200,000 and an additional $50,000 available in matching grants, according to a news release from Humanities Montana.
The money is part of a $15 million “emergency funding commitment” from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for all 56 states and jurisdictional councils of the Federation of State Humanities Councils, according to the news release.


Match the grant
Any donations received by Humanities Montana starting April 29, 2025, count towards the match, Humanities Montana said. Members of the public can donate to Humanities Montana by visiting www.humanitiesmontana.org.


Humanities Montana Executive Director Jill Baker said the organization is “deeply grateful and humbled” by the outpouring of support it has received in response to news early this month that its federal grant was being terminated.
“This significant investment from the Mellon Foundation is a powerful affirmation of the value of public humanities,” Baker said in a statement. “Investing in the public good, our communities, and our neighbors has always been a source of pride for Montanans. I remain hopeful that this tradition will hold.”
Humanities Montana supports arts and civics programs across the state. It passes on most of the money it receives to other organizations and arts projects, and last year, it said funding reached all 56 counties.
In the news release Tuesday, Humanities Montana said the money comes at a critical moment, when $65 million in federal support for state humanities councils has been eliminated as a result of federal cuts to the National Endowment for the Humanities.
However, Humanities Montana also said a nearly $500,000 shortfall remains.
“Additional support is necessary in order to continue providing a robust level of public humanities programming, which brings writers, poets, historians, scholars, artists, and performers to museums, community centers, parks, libraries, and educational institutions, including in public, private, and homeschool settings, across Big Sky Country,” the organization said in the news release.
On April 2, Humanities Montana received a letter from the acting chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities that said its grant was terminated “in its entirety” effective the same day, April 2.
The letter cited an executive order from the Trump administration to reduce “federal bureaucracy” and “safeguard the interests of the federal government, including its fiscal priorities.”
“The termination of your grant represents an urgent priority for the administration,” the letter said.
In the news release Tuesday, Humanities Montana said the loss totaled $725,000.
The funder and network of humanities councils praised the impact the arts have on communities in a separate news release Tuesday from the Mellon Foundation.
“The places where American communities come together to read, learn, and engage with the humanities’ vast and varied forms of knowledge and creativity are often those supported by these councils,” said Elizabeth Alexander, president of the Mellon Foundation, in a statement.
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation describes itself as the nation’s largest supporter of the arts and humanities with a belief that the humanities and arts are essential to human understanding.
Federation of State Humanities Councils President Phoebe Stein said the support from the Mellon Foundation allows the Federation to preserve the network, along with the connections and understanding it fosters.
“This is more than a grant — it’s a lifeline for communities across the country who rely on their humanities councils’ programs and grants to fill critical needs and enrich their lives,” Stein said in a statement.
Founded in 1977, the Federation of State Humanities Councils is the membership organization of the 56 state and jurisdictional humanities councils.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-29 22:04:26.362477
