Reporting Highlights

Serious Charge: Drivers are rarely charged with murder in fatal car crashes unless they have aggravating factors — such as past DUIs or excessive speed.
Uncommon Plea Deal: Unlike most people facing these charges in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, this defendant was not offered a plea deal for a lesser charge.
Unusual Suspect: Years after the crash, attorneys involved in the case would attempt to shed light on why it went so differently than similar cases — and what they believe was bias.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

When 19-year-old Jorge Ruiz walked into the Autauga County Jail in handcuffs on Oct. 28, 2018, he wasn’t a typical suspect. He was out of place and in big trouble in a deeply conservative part of Alabama.
That morning, he’d been driving about 70 miles per hour in a 55 zone when he crossed the center line of a two-lane rural highway. His Ford pickup collided head-on with a Honda Civic, killing the woman behind the wheel. Paramedics took Ruiz to the hospital, where a blood test found a trace amount of alcohol. At just 0.016, it was below the legal threshold for intoxication.
But rather than charging him with manslaughter, which typically would be the most extreme charge brought under the circumstances, police went further. They arrested him for murder.

To support such a murder charge, prosecutors are supposed to show that a defendant’s conduct displays “extreme indifference” — behavior so reckless that someone is likely to die, as when a person fires a gun into a crowd or steers a boat into a group of swimmers. Suspects charged with murder after car crashes often are documented to have blood alcohol levels more than twice the legal limit and 10 times the level found in Ruiz’s blood, according to a review of Alabama cases from the last 20 years by ProPublica. Many others had prior DUIs or were driving 100 miles per hour or more. In this case, the suspect had a clean criminal history and wasn’t even going fast enough to be ticketed for aggravated speeding.
Ruiz’s trial attorney said that as soon as he started talking to the district attorney’s office, the case felt different. Across the three counties in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, only a handful of people have been charged with murder for a car accident in the span of a decade — and most wound up taking a plea deal for a lesser charge.
But this time around, the prosecutor’s offer could hardly be considered a deal at all: The teenager would have to plead guilty to murder, and it would be blind plea, meaning he would have to hope for mercy from the court in his sentencing. “In my 30 years of practicing law, I have never been offered a deal like that,” Ruiz’s court-appointed lawyer, Richard Lively, said.
The lead prosecutor eventually budged, but only a little. He wouldn’t reduce the charge, but he would recommend that the teenager spend 30 years in prison.
That’s longer than any other sentence handed down since at least 2004 for a car crash fatality in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, which includes Autauga, Chilton and Elmore counties. A man who fled the scene of a fatal crash — and had a 0.09 blood alcohol level nine hours later — received a 15-year sentence in 2017. A woman who had three times the legal limit of alcohol in her system received 23 years in 2007 after she killed a University of Alabama student.
For defendants who were teenagers when they caused fatal car accidents, the courts can be even more lenient. In 2012, a Madison County judge granted youthful offender status to a man who was 19 when he was charged with murder for a drunk driving crash that killed a high school sophomore in Huntsville. The driver, who had a blood alcohol level of 0.15, was sentenced to a year in jail and two on probation.
Lively had a hard time squaring his client’s charges with the results of his blood test and recorded speed. Alabama’s murder statute does not require a driver to be legally intoxicated, and people have faced murder charges for killing someone by racing or fleeing police. But neither applied here. Lively reasoned that for murder to fit, the teenager would have had to be intentionally driving into oncoming traffic.
He thought his client could beat the charge and told him not to plead guilty. Years later, attorneys involved in the case would attempt to shed light on what was so different about it — and on one fact in particular that they believed eclipsed all the others.
He was a Mexican immigrant.
The case against Ruiz was, as one legal expert put it, “a perfect storm of horrible facts.”
The night before the accident, he stayed up late after drinking at a music festival in Birmingham. At the scene of the crash, police found beer cans in his truck. He was in the country on a temporary work visa and did not have a driver’s license. He spoke little English, relying on his 17-year-old cousin to translate his Miranda rights and the string of questions from police.
The only reason Ruiz was in Autauga County was to visit his extended family after finishing a monthslong job in Georgia and South Carolina clearing brush from power lines. He was days away from returning to Mexico.
The woman he killed was named Marlena Hayes. She was a 29-year-old nurse who’d just finished the night shift at Prattville Baptist Hospital. She wasn’t even supposed to be working at that time. She’d planned to see her brother perform that weekend with the marching band at the University of West Alabama. In the end, though, she took the shift as a favor to a colleague.

Newspapers and TV stations in central Alabama quickly picked up the story. Some referred to Ruiz as an illegal immigrant even though he’d been in the U.S. on a six-month H-2B visa, which are approved when employers can’t find enough American workers. One of those articles appeared in the Montgomery Advertiser, the largest newspaper in the area.
When Lively was assigned to the case, he felt compelled to show that his client had been in the U.S. legally. Ruiz’s visa had only lapsed when he was in jail. Lively tracked down the Montgomery Advertiser reporter at the Autauga County courthouse to show him that Ruiz’s visa had been valid when he was arrested. But even after that, the newspaper failed to acknowledge that he was in the country legally at the time of the crash. “The Montgomery Advertiser stands behind our reporting,” the newspaper said in a statement released through its parent company, Gannett.
In the years leading up to Ruiz’s arrest, Alabama had established itself as a particularly unwelcoming place for foreigners. In 2011, then-Gov. Robert Bentley signed a bill that criminalized everyday activities like transporting, employing and renting homes to undocumented immigrants.
At the time, historians and legal experts worried the law could usher in a new era of racial injustice similar to Jim Crow that would be enforced by the police and courts. But the impact of the immigration law remains largely unknown because Alabama prisons don’t collect ethnicity data and therefore don’t know how many inmates are Hispanic. In 2013, the state agreed not to enforce most of the provisions as part of a lawsuit.
“The HB 56 legislation brought nativism and xenophobia into the political mainstream in Alabama” wrote historian Raymond Mohl. At the height of the debate over the law, a congressman from north Alabama said that to prevent illegal immigration to the state, he would do “anything short of shooting them.”
Back then, those harsh policies made Alabama an outlier. But with the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, the state’s positions started going mainstream. Alabama even supplied one of the foremost architects of Trump’s first-term immigration policy: U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, a fierce champion of border crackdowns, was tapped to be Trump’s attorney general.
Ruiz was arrested nearly two years into Trump’s first term. At the time, Alabama was growing more red even as a blue wave nationally elected dozens of Democrats to Congress. In Alabama, Republicans swept statewide office that year and expanded their majority in the Legislature.
Some members of Ruiz’s extended family had started moving to Alabama from Mexico nearly 15 years earlier and stayed in the area even after the political winds turned against them. Sandra Ruiz, his 17-year-old cousin, moved from Texas to Autauga County at age 2 and had lived near Prattville, a suburb of Montgomery, nearly all her life. She knew that some of her neighbors could be ignorant of, or even hostile to, people from Mexico. She and her family were afraid for Jorge Ruiz when he was arrested and followed the police to the station. Investigators allowed the high school senior to translate their questions and Ruiz’s responses.
A judge granted Ruiz bond in March 2019, four months after he was jailed. Ruiz’s family members in Alabama sold tamales and organized a raffle of an ornate belt buckle to raise funds for bail. They posted the money to free him.
And they began to wait.
In the weeks and months leading up to Ruiz’s trial, Judge Bill Lewis made several decisions that, according to Ruiz’s lawyer, put his client at a disadvantage.
One of the first things Lewis did was revoke Ruiz’s bond. Because of a technicality, Ruiz’s family never recovered the $5,000 they’d paid to get him out of jail. The news coverage that followed the decision sparked intense, and often misinformed, debate online about the case, and Lively worried that bias would affect potential jurors. Not long after Ruiz’s bond was revoked, the judge got a letter in the mail from a local resident. The writer thanked him and asked Lewis to “do everything in your power to get justice for Marlena.” The letter went on to describe Ruiz as “in this country illegally” and “operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol.”
About a week later, Lewis denied Ruiz’s application for youthful offender status. That meant he would not be eligible for a sentence capped at three years. Lewis did not respond to a list of questions from ProPublica, including one about not granting Ruiz youthful offender status.
But as the trial neared, Lewis took several steps to attempt to keep bias out of the courtroom. He gave special instructions to the prosecution and the defense, barring any mention of Ruiz’s immigration status and directing attorneys involved in the case to call him “George.”
The judge’s efforts couldn’t erase the obvious difference between Ruiz and almost everyone else in the courtroom: the language barrier. “Longtime courthouse observers don’t recall a case in Prattville where an interpreter was used at trial,” the Montgomery Advertiser reported.
The district attorney had charged Ruiz under the reckless murder section of the statute, reserved for offenders who unintentionally cause a death. Courts have found that driving without a license, a misdemeanor that in Alabama carries a fine of $10 to $100, doesn’t constitute underlying recklessness for charges like manslaughter or murder. Prosecutors only briefly brought up at Ruiz’s trial that he did not have a license. What made the case amount to murder, the prosecutor said throughout the case, was that Ruiz was both speeding and had crossed the center line.
Ruiz’s use of alcohol also played a central role in the trial, even though he hadn’t been charged with DUI — and even though the prosecutors conceded that the evidence didn’t support that charge. A toxicologist testified that almost four hours had passed between the crash and the blood test at the hospital. He said the average elimination rate for alcohol is 0.015 percentage points an hour. That testimony suggested Ruiz’s blood alcohol level would have been higher than 0.07 at the time of the accident.
If the prosecutors could scientifically confirm that figure, it would have been enough to charge Ruiz with DUI because the legal intoxication threshold is lower for underage drivers. But such estimates have been described as unreliable by some scientists and legal experts, with one calling them no better than a “wild guess.” Some states have imposed higher bars than Alabama for the admission of such evidence, and at least one, Massachusetts, doesn’t allow it at all if the blood alcohol reading was, like Ruiz’s, below 0.03.
Lively produced no expert to dispute the toxicologist. In fact, he called only one witness, Ruiz’s date the night of the festival, who testified that Ruiz rode with her to her apartment after the festival, at around 1:30 a.m., and slept on the couch until he left at around 5 a.m.
Lively said in his closing argument that the evidence failed to show that Ruiz’s behavior was so brazenly dangerous that it amounted to murder.
“This was a person who was driving home and fell asleep behind the wheel,” Lively said.
Then-Chief Assistant District Attorney C.J. Robinson said there was no evidence Ruiz fell asleep. “In Alabama, we recognize that you can do something so dangerous that it could kill somebody, and you should realize what you’re doing is that dangerous,” he said during closing arguments. “I submit to you that anyone’s life was in danger, and therefore it was reckless murder.”
Jurors were instructed that, as an alternative to murder, they also could consider the lesser charges of manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide. They deliberated for less than an hour.
The foreman announced guilty verdicts on three counts: minor in possession of alcohol, driving without a license and murder.
Three weeks later, everyone gathered again for the sentencing. Robinson invited members of Hayes’ family to speak about their loss.
The family, along with friends, had come to every hearing. Hayes’ mother, Laura Liveoak, had spoken out on social media about her grief, describing how her daughter had texted her right before she left work that morning, asking what the weather was like. Liveoak said in a Facebook video: “It’s hard to be the parent of a victim, knowing that she’ll never be a mother. I’ll never be a grandmother to the sweet little redheaded kids that she probably would have had.” She declined to comment for this story.
Liveoak told the judge how much her daughter loved being a nurse: so much that she spent some of her days off visiting patients. She’d recently bought a house in a nearby town, Deatsville, and adopted two German shepherds who became the center of her world. She’d texted her mom right before she left work that morning. Her last message was about her dogs.

Then it was Ruiz’s turn. He spoke for the first time in court.
“I want to say that I am sorry to the family,” Ruiz said. “I wouldn’t have wished for this to happen. I wish that this would have only been a dream.”
Lewis peered down from the bench at Ruiz.
“This is America,” Lewis said. “It’s the greatest country in the world and we have the right to trial in this country. I would never penalize you for exercising that right, but Mr. Lively talked about acceptance of responsibility, contrition, remorse. I haven’t seen any of that from you.”
He sentenced Ruiz to the maximum possible punishment, longer even than the 50 years requested by prosecutors: 99 years.
The court went quiet. Even the prosecutor was shocked.
Years later, Robinson remembered that moment. “That was not something that I had expected,” he said.
In 2023, four years after the sentencing, a human rights lawyer from Mexico reached out to the Southern Center for Human Rights, a nonprofit law center in Atlanta that focuses on criminal justice. He let them know that the Mexican Consulate had been following Ruiz’s case from the time he was arrested through the slow-moving appeals process. His 99-year sentence had shocked them, and they wanted to find a lawyer in the U.S. who could steer the increasingly complicated appeal.
Ruiz’s family had cobbled together money for a private attorney, who filed motions to challenge his conviction and sentence. But they had run out of funds. Ruiz was preparing to represent himself when the attorneys from the center stepped in.
“I was like, ‘We need to help this kid,’” SCHR attorney Paulina Lucio-Maymon said. “Otherwise, he’s just gonna end up forgotten by the system.”
The Mexican Consulate connected Lucio-Maymon and her colleague Michael Admirand with family from Prattville, who in turn connected the attorneys with family in Ruiz’s hometown, José María Pino Suárez, in the Mexican state of Durango. Many in the small community knew Ruiz. As a young boy, he had helped his grandfather work a shared plot of farmland and manage his livestock. He dropped out after middle school to support his family and got his visa to come to the U.S. in the spring of 2018. He needed to make more money after his mother’s unexpected death.
“He was always trying to make sure everyone was taken care of,” said his cousin, Sandra Ruiz.
In the U.S., he was part of an all-immigrant crew of temporary visa workers employed by a contractor for the power company. The team trudged through Georgia and South Carolina backcountry, their feet snagging on roots and vines as they cleared vegetation from power lines. They often walked for 10 to 12 hours a day while carrying heavy canisters of weed-killing chemicals, and Ruiz suffered heat stroke twice, one of Ruiz’s fellow workers testified in an appeal hearing. Workers wore out their shoes every eight days, the worker said.

Ruiz wanted to spend his last few weeks in the U.S. visiting family in Prattville before returning to Mexico. He missed his daughter, Noeli, and had begun making plans for her third birthday.
None of that history had been presented at his sentencing hearing. His attorney also failed to highlight his clean criminal record in Mexico.
In September 2019, less than a month after he handed down that 99-year sentence, Lewis had issued an unusual order. He removed Lively from the case despite there being no motion seeking his removal. Lewis determined Ruiz had received inadequate representation.
Lewis cited an offhand comment Lively made at the sentencing hearing. In response to the judge admonishing Ruiz for not being contrite, Lively told the judge that the decision to take Ruiz’s case to trial “may be more of a reflection of my bad advice to him than his own acceptance of responsibility.” Lewis wrote that he saw that as an admission that Lively was questioning his own representation of Ruiz. (Lively later told ProPublica he was trying to “deflect some of Judge Lewis’ criticism of Jorge onto me” and lamented how “that one sentence has been used as a cudgel against me and a tool to scapegoat me in this case.”)
In the hearings and filings that followed, Lewis continued to express concerns about the information that had not been presented at trial or sentencing.
“The Court, when rendering a sentence in this case should have as much information as possible,” Lewis wrote in a more recent order. “Mr. Lively failed to provide any, despite having access to many different sources of information that could have affected the Defendant’s sentence.”
Lively did provide some evidence at Ruiz’s sentencing, calling his aunt and cousin to testify. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals later rejected a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against him.
In a statement to ProPublica, Lively wrote that he believed he competently defended Ruiz. He said that he only called one trial witness because he felt the state had not proven his client’s guilt. He pointed to the state’s experts, who testified that Ruiz had a very low level of alcohol in his system and drifted slowly into oncoming traffic, which, according to Lively, showed Ruiz did not intentionally jerk the car across the center line. “The most powerful witness is one that is called by the opposition who proves your case,” Lively wrote.
He also described the case as “the most traumatic” he’s encountered in his 30 years as an attorney. “I have made the law my life’s work, and Jorge’s case caused me to question almost everything I believed about the legal system,” he wrote.
When Lucio-Maymon and Admirand first took on Ruiz’s case, they appealed both his murder conviction and his 99-year sentence. Lewis rejected their challenge of Ruiz’s conviction but agreed the sentence deserved another look.
To make their case for a shorter sentence, Ruiz’s attorneys compiled information about other fatal car crash cases. His former attorneys had appealed his conviction to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and lost. The one notable dissent on the panel of judges was penned by Republican Judge J. William Cole, who wrote that the facts did not support a murder conviction.
“Ruiz had consumed alcohol before the accident, but he was not determined to be legally intoxicated, nor was he charged with driving under the influence of alcohol,” Cole wrote. “Although he crossed to the wrong side of the road, there was no evidence that he was racing or driving in a grossly wanton manner.”
Admirand and Lucio-Maymon looked at the four cases cited in the decision to uphold his conviction. The drivers in those cases had blood alcohol levels that ranged from 0.16 to 0.3 — from double to nearly quadruple the level of criminal intoxication. Their sentences ranged from 12 to 25 years in prison.
The attorneys created a simple graph that compared those sentences and blood alcohol levels. Although Ruiz had the lowest amount of alcohol in his system, his sentence was by far the longest.
After Lewis granted a new sentencing hearing, Admirand and Lucio-Maymon felt hopeful. That disparity — along with testimony from Ruiz’s friends and family in Mexico — could help sway the judge toward mercy, they believed. They said they even started talking with the district attorney’s office with the goal of making a deal, though Robinson said he remembered those conversations differently. He recalled that he agreed to listen to evidence about Ruiz’s background but wouldn’t consider reducing the charge and would be hard-pressed to recommend less than 50 years.
“They did initially express some openness to discussion in this case,” Admirand said. “And then something changed.”
Although Lewis had presided over Ruiz’s trial and granted him a resentencing hearing, he was not behind the bench when Ruiz was set to be resentenced in 2024. By then, Lewis had been appointed to the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals.
The case was transferred to Sibley Reynolds, who had retired from the bench but still took cases as needed. When Admirand and Lucio-Maymon arrived early on Aug. 14, 2024, to prepare, they found the judge sitting in the courtroom, paging through a purple binder they had never seen before. It contained pictures of Hayes and letters from friends, family members and even a few local officials.
Each of the dozens of letters urged the judge to uphold Ruiz’s 99-year sentence. Prosecutors asked the judge for 50 years. Lucio-Maymon and Admirand, citing several sentences from cases across the 19th Circuit Court, were seeking 10 years.
Admirand said he watched as Reynolds carried the binder with him to the bench. The hearing he oversaw was short but eventful. At one point, Ruiz addressed Hayes’ family.
“I am profoundly sorry for having caused you this pain,” he said. “I want to say I’m sorry or forgive me, the way I have asked God to do every day during the almost six years.”
Admirand presented all the evidence he believed had been missing from Ruiz’s first sentencing hearing in 2019. He told the judge about the cases they had found in the same judicial district with sentences that ranged from one to 25 years. And he presented mitigating factors — witnesses who testified about Ruiz’s character and work ethic.
His attorneys also played a series of videos of family members in Mexico, accompanied by dramatic music.
When Robinson, who had been elected district attorney in 2022, started to make his argument against Ruiz, he invoked a patriotic anthem as a sort of rebuttal. He said the victim’s family was ready to move on and that he was going to make a case for them “courtesy of the red, white and blue.”
It was a reference to the title of the Toby Keith song “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,” which includes lyrics like, “We’ll put a boot in your ass, it’s the American way.” Robinson would later tell ProPublica the comment was taken out of context and was meant as a critique of the music in the video, which he described as “manipulative.”
Shortly after, Hayes’ mother asked the judge to uphold the original sentence.
“I’m asking for the 99 years that Judge Lewis saw fit to give,” she said. “Marlena’s life is worth that and so much more.”
At the end of the hearing, the judge announced his decision: He would reduce Ruiz’s sentence to 50 years.
He didn’t offer an explanation for why he chose what’s still an unusually long sentence. Admirand suspected the reason might be found in the purple binder. He objected to the judge considering it without the defense having seen it. He then asked for a copy of the material.
“I mean, it’s literally letters from the victim’s family,” said Assistant District Attorney Mandy Johnson in response to the objection.
When Admirand read it right after the hearing, he found much more than that, including notes from local public officials and incorrect information about the case. He said that, more alarmingly, there were letters that included language he considered biased. One letter said that if Ruiz was released early and deported, he would surely return to the U.S.
“He will again commit crimes,” the letter said. “He will again be a draw on our judicial system and society itself. He will once again be an unnecessary threat to all our lives, including yours.”
“Fry him!” demanded another one.

The binder presented an opportunity to challenge what Admirand had come to believe was an underlying bias that permeated the case from the first moments after the crash, when a state trooper threatened to take Ruiz to jail if he did not speak English. In September 2024, he and Lucio-Maymon filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the letters contained improper references to Ruiz’s nationality, including racially derogatory claims. In February, the Mexican Consulate filed an amicus brief in support of the appeal, only the second time in five years it has done that in a criminal case in the United States.
“Ruiz’s equal protection rights were violated from the moment this prosecution began,” the appeal said. “From his earliest interactions with law enforcement through the resentencing proceedings, Ruiz was treated more harshly than other similarly situated defendants because of his race. The Court should remedy this injustice.”
In June, Ruiz’s attorneys identified another 17 car crash cases over 15 years that were heard in the 19th Circuit Court. Most defendants received sentences of less than 15 years in prison, even in cases involving multiple fatalities or high blood alcohol levels. Only one, Ruiz, had a sentence longer than 25 years. Robinson argued those cases were different, though not because of the defendant’s race. Defendants in most of them had accepted plea deals. He did not acknowledge that all of those plea deals were more lenient than the one offered to Ruiz.
Lewis did not respond to questions, including ones about alleged bias in the case. In response to ProPublica’s questions, Robinson wrote that neither he nor the district attorney’s office “treated Jorge Ruiz more harshly than other similarly situated defendants because of his race.”
Though the district attorney’s office did not charge Ruiz with DUI, Robinson wrote that alcohol “was illegally consumed at a rate much higher than legally permissible for Ruiz to be operating a vehicle.” He also wrote, “I do not assess cases using a least common denominator approach. I do my best to evaluate them based on a totality of the circumstances approach.”
In August, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals asked for more information from Reynolds about his reasoning behind the 50-year sentence. Admirand and Lucio-Maymon have asked the court to take Reynolds off the case, arguing that he improperly reviewed the purple binder material. Reynolds did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.
Hayes’ family members have been outspoken about their loss. At every hearing, they tick off the milestones Hayes has missed. Her brother’s graduation. Her sister’s wedding. The births of nieces and nephews.
Ruiz’s family members are quietly marking off their own list. His daughter’s kindergarten graduation, her First Communion. The 9-year-old still doesn’t quite comprehend where he has gone.
Ruiz has learned a little English but still struggles with the language. He said through his attorneys that he’s never been able to adequately convey how bad he feels about the accident. It’s not just the language barrier, but also that his role in Hayes’ death left him so distraught that he felt like “my life didn’t matter anymore.”
Still, the hearing last year that reduced his sentence kindled some optimism. He said that when he first faced the prospect of 99 years behind bars, the only thing he could think about was never seeing his daughter again. After the hearing, his outlook changed.
“That gave me back hope that one day I’ll be able to see my family again,” Ruiz said.

Dubbed by fans and peers as the King of Reality TV, the Detroit-born producer has built franchises that travel beyond the coasts. His “Love & Marriage” franchise has turned Huntsville, Alabama, Detroit and Washington into must-see television along with “Family Empire: Houston.” His other hit “Belle Collective” put Jackson, Mississippi, on the cultural map and returned with a new season this month on OWN.
As a former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” producer, King is showing that compelling stories thrive wherever real people live, love and grind. Through his company, Kingdom Reign Entertainment, he says more than 60% of OWN’s original programming carries his imprint, crediting the network’s top executives such as Oprah Winfrey, Tina Perry and Drew Tappon for backing his vision.
Beyond television, King has expanded his reach with the popular podcast “Reality with the King” and on-camera hosting, cementing his status as both creator and voice of the culture.
In a recent conversation with The Associated Press, King opened up about independence, building generational wealth, navigating racism and homophobia as an openly gay Black man. He also touches on how he feels about being called the “Black Andy Cohen,” a nod to the “Real Housewives” executive producer and late-night host who became Bravo’s on-air face.
AP: What does the “King of Reality TV” mean to you?
KING: It solidifies my place in this business of unscripted television. Having a successful production company, Kingdom Reign Television, having the No. 1 show on Oprah Winfrey’s Network, “Love and Marriage Huntsville,” to a number one podcast, “Reality with the King,” so all those things are underneath me, my brand and my empire. The title means a lot to me and my brand. The audience understands I’m multifaceted and multitalented. It holds a lot of weight, but I’m definitely somebody that understands the assignment.
AP: Why is ownership such a priority for you?
KING: In our business, unfortunately, you create a show and you’re at the mercy of the network, which is just our business. And that’s just the way things are, right? You do the work and once you sell the show to the network, you don’t own the show anymore. I’m all about ownership and the fact that if I put in the sweat equity, then I want all of the profits. I want all of the margins coming to me because I did the work, I created the idea. I found the cast. I developed the show. I want to own everything that I do, and that’s where my vision is right now.
The beauty of my podcast is the fact that I own it. No one can tell me what to do with it. Those opportunities of ownership is fantastic because you’re able to really create your own destiny and look for partnerships that makes sense versus doing the archaic way of this business that I just don’t have the desire to do anymore.
AP: How have you navigated systemic barriers?
KING: I have seen it all, I’ve been through it all: homophobia, racism. I’ve seen that all of my life, personal and professional. However, for me, I never allowed that to be my disadvantage. I found ways to make that my superpower. I found ways to make sure that I stood up for myself and for my people in meetings, in conversations, and inappropriate discussions where shade was thrown very subliminally. I allowed myself to be a disrupter in a very different way.

I didn’t feel the need to be super outspoken in the moment and made a scene out of it. Because I knew that if I did that, I wouldn’t be asked back to do the job. I knew to stand up for myself and my community in a way that was digestible to them. But I always knew that you have learned a valuable lesson, and you take these conversations that are happening around you, and you allow that to fuel you into being an agent of change in other situations.
AP: What are the three keys to building a successful reality show?
KING: No. 1, the cast. A show lives or dies by the cast. You got to find a great cast. No. 2 is what’s the angle? If I did a show about a group of Black people in Atlanta … oh right, kind of seen it. But if I do a show about Black couples in Huntsville. Well, that piques my interest. Tell me more about it. Find the angle that isn’t already out there. No. 3, authenticity is key. Have an authentic group of people who want to share their lives.
The three things that don’t work:
First is a group of cast members who do not want to share their reality. You’re losing. Two, an angle that is familiar. I get pitched sometimes, “I’m going do a show about X, Y and Z.” And I’m like, “That’s already on the air. There’s nothing special about that. Take another big swing at the idea.” Find out what’s missing on television and create that yourself. Don’t create another copy of a show that’s already on the air. And No. 3, fakeness. Oh my gosh, the audience can spot a fake. I can spot a fake.
AP: Why did you set “Love & Marriage” in Huntsville and “Belle Collective” in Jackson?
KING: I wanted to tap into a market that I felt was underserved and just wasn’t getting their just due. I wanted to tell Black stories in inner cities and towns that aren’t prevalent like a LA, New York, Miami. I wanted to be able to show the world that these people do exist, and they should not be forgotten about. Not a lot of people, including me, have heard of Huntsville until I met some of the people and I’m like, “Oh, you guys have a great story.”
AP: How do you feel about being referred to as the Black version of Andy Cohen?
KING: I want people to really pay attention to the individualism that we both offer in this community of unscripted. For me, when it comes to my legacy, I feel very confident that people are now seeing the difference between (him) and I, and they’re now seeing the amount of work I’m doing with my podcast, my YouTube channel, the work that I’m doing with creating shows in different parts of the world that are untapped.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)As the former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, my job was to protect both public health and the environment, including protecting Americans from toxic exposures. In that mission, the EPA and the Make America Healthy Again movement are aligned. Children cannot thrive in a degraded environment, and it’s up to agencies like EPA and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to safeguard the most vulnerable. Together, they are on the front lines of Making America Healthy Again.
We’ve recently seen a pernicious narrative begin to circulate that the state of Idaho “quietly rewrote” its cancer regulations to benefit Idaho’s Stibnite Gold Project, and in doing so, put children’s health at risk.
Let’s be clear: That’s not what happened.
U.S. Forest Service approves Stibnite Gold Mine in Central Idaho

The Stibnite Gold Project has been carefully studied, engineered and permitted over the course of 16 years. This is not a slapdash process, but one rooted in science and wrapped in safeguards to protect workers, communities and the environment.
Idaho DEQ didn’t rewrite the rulebook on assessing cancer risks; in fact, it used the EPA’s. The EPA has a conservative, gold standard methodology for assessing health risk. It’s been used for decades, and is designed to be protective of sensitive populations, like pregnant women and children.
Using EPA and Idaho DEQ’s standard formula, regulators considered the project’s maximum possible arsenic emissions if the mine operates all day, every day, for 16 straight years, which is an extremely conservative assumption that cannot in fact occur under actual operational constraints.
Nonetheless, based on this conservative assumption, Idaho DEQ calculated the lifetime additional cancer risk from project emissions to be four in one million or about 1 in 240,000; Idaho’s protective standard is 1 in 100,000, which means the excess cancer risk from the project is 41% less than what Idaho law requires. To further put that in perspective, the odds of being struck by lightning in your lifetime are 1 in 15,000.
The conclusion? Emissions from the Stibnite Gold Project do not pose unacceptable excess cancer risk for anyone.
Claims that Idaho somehow bent the rules to accommodate the project were tested in a full administrative hearing before an independent hearing officer, during which multiple toxicologists, scientists and permit engineers testified. After reviewing the evidence, the hearing officer concluded that Idaho correctly applied the risk assessment methodology and wholly rejected litigants’ claims. The Idaho DEQ Board unanimously upheld that decision.
Zooming out, while this debate has focused on permitting and risk methodology, Idahoans deserve to understand the broader picture and why this project matters:
The Stibnite Gold Project will supply the only American reserve of the critical mineral antimony, which is controlled by China. We need antimony for our national defense, our military needs it for artillery, munitions, and equipment. We also need it for civilian and renewable energy uses, including batteries and semiconductors.
The United States sets the gold standard for environmental regulations while China has terrible environmental practices. The choice is to mine antimony and other minerals in an environmentally responsible manner in the U.S. or rely on China and others who will increase global pollution through their mining practices.
What’s more, this project will actually remediate the environment and eliminate toxins polluting the environment today. The Stibnite Gold Project sits on an abandoned mine site, where one ton of arsenic currently flows into the river every single year. This project will pick up and reprocess 10 million tons of mine waste and tailings, get heavy metals out of Idaho rivers, and make the environment cleaner and safer for everyone.
We must encourage projects like this in order to address the waste from abandoned mining sites that plague the West.
Protecting people and the environment is the core mission of environmental regulators. EPA standards are deliberately conservative, independent experts vet the data, and this project was only approved after demonstrating it would protect both human health and the environment. The Stibnite Gold Project doesn’t clash with MAHA — it embodies it.
Suggesting otherwise isn’t advocacy, it’s fearmongering. Idaho families deserve decisions grounded in science, transparency and truth. On all counts, the Stibnite Gold Project meets the mark.

(Photo: John Partipilo)The Vanderbilt Faculty Senate, an elected body composed of deans and representative faculty members, has formally opposed entering into a compact with the Trump administration to comply with new directives in exchange for preferential access to funding.
In an emergency meeting Wednesday, the senate passed a resolution that condemned the proposed compact as a likely violation of state and federal law, and an infringement on the constitutional rights of university members.
“The Faculty Senate of Vanderbilt University firmly opposes this Compact as written and calls upon Chancellor (Daniel) Diermeier and the Board of Trust to also reject this Compact outright as well as any similar proposal compromising the mission, values and independence of the University,” the resolution said. 
The resolution was enacted with a 30-11 vote with one member abstaining.
Vanderbilt campus groups push back against Trump administration higher ed ‘compact’

The demand that Vanderbilt and eight other elite universities sign onto the so-called “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” whose details were first reported in the Wall Street Journal, has drawn criticism from campus groups and free speech advocates. 
The 10-page proposed contract would require the schools to adhere to a number of ideological goals set by the Trump administration. Among them is that campus faculty and employees abstain from actions and speech about off-campus political events, capping foreign student enrollment and a commitment to use “lawful force if necessary,” to combat protests that impede access to campus facilities.
The directives, the resolution said, “”contains provisions antithetical to the missions and traditions of the university” and “endanger(s) the independence and integrity of the university.”
A Vanderbilt spokesperson referred to a statement posted on the university’s X account that said, “we look forward to carefully reviewing the compact and providing meaningful feedback to the administration.”
In addition to Vanderbilt, letters proposing the compact were sent to Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Virginia.

But as a small business owner who relies on data-powered advertising, analytics, and personalized outreach to customers, I was alarmed to see Maine lawmakers downplay the risks of adopting rigid “data minimization” rules like those in the Maryland Online Privacy Rights Act. Maryland’s law is an outlier, going further than even California or Europe in restricting how data can be collected and used. If Maine were to enact similar provisions, it would seriously hurt small businesses like mine.
Fourteen years ago, my wife and I started making soy-wax candles in a boathouse on our Edgecomb property. Today, we sell our candles in L.L. Bean, Whole Foods, and specialty retailers nationwide, as well as from our own studio in Edgecomb, Boothbay Harbor store, and online shop. 
Data plays a critical role in our business’s growth. Aggregated data — showing things like which products most interest our customers and the regions where our products are popular — helps us understand our customer base and improve our marketing. And past-purchase data allows us to tell existing customers about new products or special deals, helping build customer loyalty. 
In addition, our digital advertising partners use non-personally identifiable data to show our ads to people most likely to be interested in our products — for example, people who’ve been searching online for candles or gift shops in our area. That means we don’t waste money advertising to people who aren’t interested in scented candles. And data analytics from our partners show which ads are most effective, allowing us to pull or tweak poor performers. In short, data helps us make the most of our small marketing and advertising budget — enabling us to connect with customers, generate sales, compete with much bigger manufacturers, and grow our business.
“Data minimization” rules would prevent Maine small businesses like ours from fully leveraging data for these critical purposes, because they’d limit us to using customers’ data only to provide products or services customers specifically requested. If we can’t use data to inform and power our marketing and advertising, we’ll struggle to understand and reach customers — and make sales. And because the data in question is non-personally identifiable, the benefit to consumers’ privacy would be minimal.
Protecting consumers’ privacy is important. But overregulating data would make it harder for Maine small businesses to survive and grow — at a time when we’re already struggling with economic uncertainty, inflation, and tariffs. I know that lawmakers are well-intentioned, but they also need to be realistic about how data regulations will affect small businesses. Mainers will be best served by balanced legislation that safeguards consumers’ data while allowing small businesses to grow, compete, and succeed.

(Alex Brandon/AP)In one of his stand-up sets, comedian David Cross rejects all political commentary that tries to answer the question, “What would America’s Founding Fathers think if they were alive today?”
For Cross, it is pointless to speculate about the present-day views of men who could not have imagined cotton candy, let alone the machine that makes it.
“What’s a machine? What’s a machine???” he screams in their collective voice, recoiling from the sorcery of the state fair.
The first time I saw this bit, something odd happened. Having just read the 1776 political pamphlet “Common Sense,” I could hear its author, one of America’s founders, laughing louder than anybody.
That would be Thomas Paine, the man credited with turning the American Revolution from a complicated Colonial fracas into a titanic struggle for the soul of liberty itself.
If Cross is skeptical that anything 250 years old still holds up, Paine, were he alive today, could probably name one thing: skepticism. Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact.
Saying “no” — especially to those in power — is an underrated American pastime, and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.”
I could go on. Because he did.
 
Birth of a revolutionary
Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737. Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London, sailed to America, and there found his true métier as a pamphleteer and radical.
Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine renounced, repudiated and ridiculed at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. Hereditary privilege, colonialism, the supernatural: no, no, no.
But what Paine made his name lambasting — what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force — were kings. All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime.
“Common Sense,” his first major work, was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them.
 
‘Simple facts, plain arguments’
Exactly what was Paine’s problem with kings?
The same problem you’ll have, “Common Sense” promises, when you examine the evidence.
This is partly the secret of Paine’s rhetorical power: It’s difficult to imagine any wordsmith demanding more vigorously that you not take his word for it.
Paine was a student of history, and history is chock-full of receipts. It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.”
Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch.
“One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all.
 
Bring the Paine
The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant.
This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal.
But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch.
“Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.”
Federal worker firings, court settlements, a government shutdown. Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him.
Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown.
This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke.
The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced.
Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)If there were a trophy for squandering opportunity, Nebraska would already have it on the shelf.
On Sept. 3, the Nebraska Broadband Office, or NBO, released its draft final proposal for how to spend $405 million in federal broadband funds. Advocates for rural broadband like myself fought hard for that money, challenging providers’ overstated coverage and identifying tens of thousands of missing locations.
The federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program, or BEAD, promised to fix rural broadband in Nebraska once and for all. Instead, NBO fumbled. Out of $405 million, the plan spends barely $43 million and connects fewer than 1,300 locations to fiber broadband. More than $350 million is left untouched, likely to go back to D.C. without benefiting our state. That’s not planning. It is malpractice.
Fiber is permanent infrastructure. It is reliable, weatherproof and built to last for decades. It is the backbone of education, healthcare, precision agriculture, artificial intelligence, manufacturing and remote work.
NBO’s alternative? Fixed wireless and satellite. Both have their place, and they aren’t inherently bad solutions for rural connectivity. But their performance, reliability and future scalability pale in comparison to fiber. Relegating over 10,000 rural homes and businesses to second-class broadband is a disservice to every Nebraskan — a patch job, not progress. Betting Nebraska’s future on them is like renting a tent in tornado alley and calling it a house.
NBO claims Nebraska’s proposal is “connecting homes, businesses and community anchor institutions.” Optimistic and only half-true. More than 700 schools, libraries, fire departments and health centers were identified as eligible for BEAD’s funding for that purpose. NBO chose to connect only 54.
NBO’s biggest misstep was how it handled location eligibility. Nebraska started with nearly 30,000 eligible locations. Then NBO let unlicensed wireless providers claim coverage without proof. No maps. No evidence. Just “trust us.” Overnight, 7,500 locations were suddenly reclassified as “served.” Add in federal map changes, and Nebraska lost 52% of its list. Most states cut none.
Then there are the satellites. NBO is spending $2.3 million on Amazon’s Project Kuiper, a service with zero customers and a handful of test satellites in orbit. The proposal trusts Jeff Bezos’ hobby project to serve 1,500 Nebraskans. SpaceX’s Starlink, which already covers Nebraska, gets another $2.5 million to serve places it already serves. This is internet meant to power a campsite, not an economy.
Transparency is scarce. Since Sept. 3, NBO has revised its project list three times, each time cutting funding for schools and libraries with neither explanation nor notice. Just moving numbers around and leaving the public and providers in the dark.
Meanwhile, our neighbors are lapping us. Iowa and Kansas, with the same “flat and treeless” terrain Nebraska used as an excuse, each connected about half of their locations to fiber. Wyoming and Montana, with tougher topography, managed two to three times Nebraska’s fiber commitment. North Dakota? 93% fiber. Nebraska? Dead last — an outlier in the worst way.
Yes, the rules changed. Yes, it made the job harder. But the job is not to roll over when Washington makes things difficult. The job is to fight for Nebraskans, not fold. That is surrender, not leadership.
Excuses might make the politics easier, but they do not bring lasting infrastructure to our farms, schools, businesses and families. If other states can push back and still commit to fiber, Nebraska could too.
Our state’s chance at full connectivity is fading before our eyes. Nebraska appears poised to leave more than $350 million on the table and lock rural communities into second-rate service.
Nebraskans didn’t fight for $405 million to watch it evaporate. Fiber is the gold standard, and we deserve leaders with the backbone to deliver it. Anything less is a betrayal of every family, farmer, business and student left behind on the wrong side of the digital divide.

(Sandra Mu/Getty Images)The Nebraska Broadband Office (NBO) is proud to announce the achievement of our most significant milestone – the allocation of more than $42 million in Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program awards to connect the final 14,032 unserved and underserved Nebraska locations to high-speed, reliable broadband.
These awards, pending final approval by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), represent the biggest step yet toward total connectivity in our state.
This achievement is the result of years of steady effort, persistence and adaptation to changing federal guidance. NBO has worked tirelessly to meet every requirement of the BEAD program while keeping our focus on the needs of Nebraskans.
Creation of the NBO was one of Gov. Jim Pillen’s first initiatives. Our work now is to carry out his vision to meet Nebraska’s broadband needs — especially in rural communities — by ensuring access that is affordable, reliable and high-speed.
The final 14,000 locations are the most challenging to connect. These are the places that providers have historically been reluctant to serve, as evidenced by the lack of applications to serve them received by our office.
For the first time, every one of these locations now has a firm commitment to receive the same quality of broadband service available in our most connected communities. This is an extraordinary accomplishment that reflects a commitment to broadband for all.
Nebraska’s plan embraces every solution, creating a deployment strategy that is practical and forward-looking. These technologies not only exceed NTIA’s current requirements but are evolving rapidly, operating at the cutting edge and advancing before our eyes. Most importantly, this approach gets service to families and businesses faster.
Our plan also extends impact beyond homes and businesses by connecting 54 community anchor institutions, such as libraries, hospitals and fire stations that serve as vital hubs for communities. This new infrastructure will strengthen Nebraska’s capacity for healthcare, education and emergency response while laying infrastructure that nearby communities can build upon.
Our work will not stop here. As of this proposal, approximately $324.6 million of Nebraska’s BEAD allocation remains unspent. NBO is aggressively working to keep these funds in the state. This would allow us to pursue non-deployment investments that will multiply the impact of these funds – enhancing precision agriculture, expanding access to healthcare technologies, supporting digital workforce readiness and preparing communities for an AI-driven economy.
These efforts, combined with our deployment plan, will broaden opportunities for every Nebraskan, ensuring that both our people and our communities thrive in a rapidly evolving world.
This plan reflects the very best of Nebraska: persistence, adaptability and innovation. By combining the strengths of multiple technologies and preparing for what comes next, we are setting the stage for a broadband network that will serve Nebraskans today and keep our state at the forefront of connectivity tomorrow.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Maryland police leaders face an unprecedented crisis in American law enforcement. The Trump administration’s deployment of masked federal agents, militarization of immigration enforcement and attempted use of National Guard troops for civilian policing represents a fundamental threat to constitutional governance and professional law enforcement.
The current federal approach bears little resemblance to traditional law enforcement. More than 75% of people booked into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in fiscal year 2025 had no criminal conviction other than an immigration or traffic-related offense, with less than 10% convicted of serious crimes like murder, assault, robbery or rape.
This isn’t targeted enforcement of dangerous criminals; it’s indiscriminate sweeps of immigrant communities.
Federal agents hide their faces during arrests. U.S. citizens have been detained by masked agents in plain clothes. These are methods of authoritarian regimes, not constitutional democracies.
Federal law enforcement resources are being diverted wholesale from their core missions. FBI agents, U.S. Marshals, ATF agents, DEA agents and Homeland Security personnel who should be investigating terrorism, organized crime, drug-related crimes and white-collar crimes are instead conducting immigration sweeps.
Against this backdrop, Maryland’s expansion of 287(g) participation from three to eight sheriff’s offices in 2025 entangles local police in a fundamentally compromised federal operation. When Maryland agencies sign 287(g) agreements, they become part of a system that operates without accountability, violates constitutional norms and destroys community trust.

Research shows 287(g) programs significantly reduce violent crime reporting among victims. In Maryland’s diverse communities, home to significant immigrant populations in Baltimore, Montgomery County, Prince George’s County, Frederick County and elsewhere, domestic violence victims won’t call police, witnesses won’t cooperate with homicide investigations and human-trafficking victims will remain hidden – subjected to greater risk.
The current federal immigration enforcement crisis makes community policing principles more essential than ever. Decades of research demonstrate that effective policing requires community cooperation, trust and legitimacy. When communities view police as partners in public safety, crime reporting increases, witness cooperation improves and crime prevention becomes possible.
Many Maryland agencies have invested in community policing models, building relationships with neighborhood groups and earning legitimacy through fair treatment of all residents. These relationships take years to build but can be destroyed overnight.
The Trump administration’s aggressive tactics are already creating fear in immigrant communities across Maryland. Children are afraid to go to school. Workers won’t report wage theft or workplace safety violations. Domestic violence victims are staying in dangerous situations.
For Maryland police leaders, this environment demands a choice: Double down on community policing efforts or sacrifice community trust and collaborative problem solving for politicized federal immigration priorities. There is no middle ground.
Professional law enforcement organizations, the Police Executive Research Forum, Major Cities Chiefs Association and International Association of Chiefs of Police, all warn that immigration enforcement by local police fundamentally undermines community trust and public safety.
Maryland chiefs and sheriffs have professional and constitutional obligations that transcend federal pressure. They must maintain operational independence, protect constitutional policing, preserve community relationships, consider exiting 287(g) where applicable, resist militarization and document federal overreach.
Maryland has worked for decades to professionalize law enforcement, implement community policing and build trust with diverse populations. Community policing isn’t just a buzzword – it’s an operational necessity that enables police to solve crimes, prevent violence and maintain public safety.
This moment demands that Maryland police leaders remember why community policing principles emerged in the first place: because enforcement-only models don’t work. Aggressive, militarized policing that treats communities as occupied territory creates the conditions for crime to flourish by destroying the community cooperation that effective policing requires.
The question facing Maryland police leaders isn’t whether immigration law should be enforced, that’s a federal policy matter. The question is whether local police will maintain their professional integrity and constitutional obligations in the face of federal overreach.
The evidence is clear: 287(g) participation exacerbates every problem created by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics. Maryland police leaders who prioritize public safety, constitutional governance and professional policing must reject this false choice between federal cooperation and their core mission. Their loyalty is to the Constitution, to professional standards and to the communities they serve, not to a federal administration that has abandoned all three.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54348554551_ce02f39035_o-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-11 00:57:08.108551

On Thursday, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) canceled an environmental review of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project – a sprawling development of seven geographically contiguous utility-scale solar projects that would cover more than 62,000 acres  nearly 100 square miles — of public land about 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nevada.
The joint project was proposed by six solar energy companies, including NextEra Energy Resources, Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power and Invenergy.
All together, the network of solar panels and batteries in Esmeralda County was expected to produce as much as 6.2 gigawatts of energy under ideal conditions, or enough electricity to power nearly two million homes.

After months of delays, the Department of the Interior this week said it was canceling its broad environmental review of the joint project and would instead review the seven projects that make up the development separately “to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”
The Department of the Interior said the impacted energy companies will now have the option to submit a separate application for their individual project proposals. 
“The BLM did not cancel the project. During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada,” said an Interior spokesperson in an email Friday.
“Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts,” the email continued. 
It’s unclear how many of the impacted solar companies will continue to pursue their individual projects after the change in how the proposals will be reviewed.
A spokesperson for NextEra Energy Resources said the company was committed to their individual project – the Esmeralda Energy Center – which is a part of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project. 
“NextEra Energy Resources is one of six companies pursuing projects in Esmeralda County, Nevada. We are in the early stage of development and remain committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with the Bureau of Land Management,” a spokesperson for NextEra Energy Resources said in an email Friday. 
A spokesperson for Leeward Energy, one of the companies involved in the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, said “we don’t have any information to share regarding the project update.”
Representatives for the other four energy companies involved in developing the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project did not respond to requests for comment.
Kevin Emmerick, the co-founder of Basin and Range Watch, said he’s skeptical solar companies involved in the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project would be eager to resubmit applications after “tariffs and roadblocks set by the administration.”
In July the Trump administration mandated that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, a threshold that Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo said has already stalled several solar projects in the state. 
Emmerick, who opposed the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, said he isn’t surprised the project’s broad environmental review was canceled given the new rules under the Trump administration, and suspects singular approval of each project will be even more cumbersome.
“Solar and wind energy have several new layers of approval for each individual project so this programmatic review for all seven projects makes that kind of individual scrutiny very difficult,” Emmerick said. 
Federal land managers began reviewing the developers’ joint proposals in 2023 under former president Joe Biden. But the project’s environmental review process has been stalled since Donald Trump took office. 
Federal land managers were expected to issue a final environmental impact statement for the project — the last step before a record of decision is issued — at the end of April, but neither materialized. 
The project has attracted strong opposition from locals and conservation groups who caution the size of the project could negatively impact the environment and rural communities’ way of life. 
Several conservation groups have asked federal land managers to move the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project to areas the BLM has earmarked as “solar energy zones” — areas it sees as prime for solar development. Esmeralda County has two solar energy zones, encompassing about 21,000 acres of land. 
Shaaron Netherton, the executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, said she hopes the cancellation of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project “will be an opportunity moving forward to find better sites for solar development.”
“We need to focus on disturbed  areas and utilize warehouse and data center roofs for solar before using vast stretches of our public lands,” said Netherton, who opposed the joint project. 
“Storey County is being completely developed for industrial buildings. This would be a great place to cover with solar. Producing energy right where it is needed,” she said. 
Locals have also expressed frustration with solar companies’ lack of communication when proposing projects. Esmeralda County commissioner Fred Perez said more than a dozen solar companies have proposed projects in his county. Perez said none of those companies have been in communication with him, including the companies that comprise the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project.
Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the BLM needs to further clarify “its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process.”
“We remain deeply concerned that this administration continues to flout the law to the detriment of consumers, the grid, and America’s economic competitiveness,” Norris said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sevensolarblmcover-1024x698.jpeg,,,2025-10-11 00:57:08.108551

He identifies with the Black Robe Regiment, a coalition of pastors committed to tearing down the wall of separation between church and state.
Still, the Rev. Jack Martin insists politics won’t interfere with his volunteer school service.
Living in Hernando County since 1997, he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2016 and in 2022. In the 2022 Republican primary, Martin came in second to U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, earning 9.2% of the vote.
Martin remains politically active, particularly through his Facebook and Rumble accounts, posting an array of social media videos supporting Republicans and criticizing Democrats. Among his posts:

An ode to Charlie Kirk.
A video criticizing U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the government shutdown, calling him “Uncle Chuckles.”
An image boosting “Pastors for Trump.”
A photo calling for former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be deputized so he can arrest former President Barack Obama.
A video advocating for ivermectin to treat COVID-19, which Martin says saved his life after catching COVID.

“If we want our country back, we can’t stand as spectators applauding Donald Trump.  We need to take our armor, get out there in the battle alongside of Donald Trump,” Martin said during an appearance before the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly.
(Screenshot via Rev. Jack Martin’s Facebook profile)
Martin told the Phoenix that “without apology there are things he [Trump] does I don’t like, too,” and that his support for Trump is “in areas that are restoring our country to be a more sound republic.”
Still, Martin insists his motivation to serve as a chaplain is “not anything political, it’s not to proselytize, it’s to help kids.”
Registered as clergy under the Christian Life Assembly of God church, the Rev. Martin is listed as a chaplain on the Hernando County Schools’ website, meaning he is qualified to “provide support, services, and programs” to students who seek it out.
A 2024 law, HB 931, that permits volunteer chaplains drew backlash from some faith leaders for the possibility it would lead to religious proselytization of students, “undermine the secular nature of public education,” and violate the Establishment Clause, the part of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits government establishment or preference of a religion, the Phoenix has reported.
Faith leaders warn schools of dangers of optional, voluntary chaplain program

The Freedom From Religion Foundation is asking the district to backtrack and not only take away Martin’s permission to serve as a chaplain but to eliminate the entire program, which is voluntary for students.
“Rev. Martin has openly promoted Christian nationalism and disparaged public education itself. His stated views are incompatible with the religious neutrality required of public schools and threaten to undermine the trust and inclusivity essential to serving Hernando County’s diverse student body,” the foundation wrote in its letter to Hernando officials.
The foundation advocated for access for students to “trained professionals such as school counselors, psychologists, and social workers — not clergy advancing religious or political agendas.”
“Please understand that permitting a religious chaplaincy in a public school district jeopardizes the rights of students and parents and invites legal challenge,” the organization’s legal counsel, Christopher Line, concluded in his letter.
Constitutional concerns
The retired Pentecostal pastor told the Phoenix in a phone interview this week he does not share constitutional concerns about the program. He’s “100% sure before the Supreme Court that it would be proven pure and good.”
As chaplain, Martin said, he will try to be “one more layer in a system that’s trying to help our kids get through school and graduate as healthy as they can.”
A father of six homeschooled children, Martin served as chaplain for Spring Hill Fire and Hernando County Fire for 17 years. That experience, he said, has prepared him to work with students.
If a tragedy such as a school shooting were to happen, “I would be the most trained — even out of their counselors — I would be the most trained to be able to go in and immediately start to help,” Martin told the Phoenix.

Citing his outspokenness about Jan. 6, 2021, and his commitment to the Black Robe Regiment, the Freedom From Religion Foundation has called Martin a Christian nationalist.
His response: “I am a Christian who loves the United States of America, the nation that God has allowed me to be born and live in. And I respect the laws of the land. And I respect the word of God. And I attempt, the best I can, to live in a manner that would be the life the way Jesus would have done it.”
Martin does identify as a Black Robe Regiment pastor. The national organization with that name bills itself as a “modern-day network of patriotic pastors and religious leaders striving to safeguard liberty by helping clergy and community leaders step into their God-given duty of leading from the pulpit, in the community, and in government.”
A 2022 Vice report cited by the Freedom From Religion Foundation asserts the Black Robe Regiment does fall within the rubric of Christian nationalism, having ties to Gen. Flynn, who in his Reawakening America tours has argued “the church should be at the heart of all aspects of American society.”
Martin says the Vice story is inaccurate. “I mean the Black Robe Regiment is a term, it’s not one group of people,” he said.
Last month, Martin posted on the Black Robe Regiment Facebook group, of which he’s an administrator, “I say this in humility but mark down that the first Public School Chaplain in the State of Florida is a Black Robe Regiment pastor.”
Martin insists the topics he’s been outspoken about would not be part of his offerings as a chaplain.
“In the past, at school board meetings, I’ve spoken on vaccines, on mandatory masking, and things like that. But those were as a citizen and those were prior to any chaplaincy program existing. But they would not be something that would be talked about,” Martin said.

In an appearance before the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly in August, Martin said he could help combat bullying in schools and calm kids after any bomb or gun scares.
Martin said he was invited to speak to the organization, which declares “everything else will fall into proper place by reforming the Republican Party with Judeo-Christian conservative constitutionalists with the Courage to do what’s right.”
“I hear a lot of pastors say, ‘We’ve fixed the problem, we’ve got Christian schools.’ My only problem with that is, what about all the kids that are still in public school and who are still being forced to believe stuff they shouldn’t?” Martin told the Assembly.
The Rev. Martin has amplified right-wing talking points blaming transgender people for political violence. The day after a shooter opened fire at a Catholic school in Minnesota, Martin told the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly that, “if long before that, somebody had sat down and helped those young people, they would have got the help they need.”
In addressing gender-confirming care, Martin told the Phoenix, “My personal view — and, again, I could not use this one in the school, obviously — but my personal view is that you’re hurting kids. It would be like telling the anorexic if you eat more it will get better, you’re just hurting them. And I think my whole heart in trying to be a chaplain is to help kids, not to hurt them and not to create a bigger problem than already exists.”
(Screenshot via Rev. Jack Martin’s Facebook profile)
Martin has a Rumble channel called “THE HARD RIGHT SAVING AMERICA” and publishes songs he’s written. One title is “The Ballad of J6ers,” a “tribute” to participants in the events that transpired in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, which he called “no insurrection. It was a 1A protest by citizens.”
“I am a man who loves my country, I was in D.C. that day along with my good buddies believing free speech worked that way,” Martin wrote in his  lyrics, although he stresses he wasn’t there.
There’s an accompanying video featuring clips of  the insurrection and an artificial intelligence-generated image of Obama being handcuffed by FBI agents in the Oval Office as Trump watches.
“And maybe justice will be served and the bad folks are put in jail,” the song continues.
Martin told the Phoenix the Freedom From Religion Foundation’s criticism is incorrect.
“They referred to a song that I had written and I used the quote the president [Trump] used. I want them to go be peaceful protests, and they tried to make it as if I said that was a peaceful protest. I have my own view on that day,” Martin said — going on to allege that more than 270 Deep State “insiders” were among protesters. “I have questions that there was at least some shenanigans with that day.”
Xs and Os
The Hernando County School Board approved language implementing the state’s first public school chaplain the program earlier this year, making it the first district to welcome the volunteer religious figures.
“Pastor Jack, I want to say that I appreciate everything that you have done in leading this chaplain program. I have worked with you hand-in-hand, day-after-day, week-after-week, we’ve had a few months at this, and it’s been some long, hard discussions,” Hernando School Board Chair Shannon Rodriguez said during a school board meeting last month. “I’m honored to come alongside of you.”
The district’s policies outline that chaplains:

May provide religious or spiritual guidance to students, lead students in prayer, and offer reflective, non-judgmental listening to students who are going through a difficult time.
May not seek to persuade or force any student to participate.
May not proselytize for or disparage any religion, belief, lack of belief, or faith group
Provision of care, help or counsel is not proselytization or disparagement.

The district, which operates more than 20 schools, requires chaplains to obtain “an ecclesiastical endorsement from their faith group” to certify they are indeed a leader in the faith, “qualified spiritually, morally, intellectually, and emotionally to serve as a chaplain for the board,” and “sensitive to religious pluralism and able to provide for the free exercise of religion by all students.” 
The policy prescribes that “the selection of a chaplain should reflect the expectations of the local community.”
The program has officially started, although Martin said his counsel has not yet been called upon. 
The policies require interested parents to opt in and provide Martin protections from lawsuits. 
The law requires interested school chaplains to first pass a Level 2 background check, “a state and national fingerprint-based check and consideration of disqualifying offenses and applies to those employees designated by law as holding positions of responsibility or trust.”
After passing the background check, a chaplain wishing to provide services must schedule a consultation with a school principal and interested parents to earn signatures from both parties.
“I would like to look at this three years down the road and see the value of what’s come out of the program, and be able to look back and say, ‘See, this is why I thought it was effective,'” Martin said. 
After the Phoenix’s interview with Martin, a second chaplain was added to the district website, Shawn May, registered with Great Life Church, a non-denominational church in Spring Hill.
State definition of ‘religion’ too narrow, Satanic Temple says

Although groups have raised criticisms and threatened legal action, Martin said he hopes Hernando’s program “can prove to be effective to the good of the school and the students in a way that, if other counties wanted to try it, they would model a program. 
“The school board has done an incredible job of implementing a program that limits what I can do and that’s fine with me,” he added. 
Last year, pastors opposed to chaplains entering schools told the Phoenix they disagreed with its “scout’s honor” system to not proselytize.
Following the passage of the chaplain law, the Satanic Temple told the Florida Gannett newspapers that it intends to take advantage of the law, the Phoenix reported last year. They since have complained that the state’s model policy for districts to carry out the law was too narrow.

A majority of the Douglas County Board, which oversees the county jail as the Board of Corrections, issued a statement Friday objecting to the idea announced Thursday by Sheriff Aaron Hanson.

The statement by Commissioners Chris Rodgers, Jim Cavanaugh, Brian Fahey and Board Chair Roger Garcia offered several reasons for the rationale of the majority on the seven-member elected board.
Garcia previously rebuffed the idea of contracting jail space to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold detainees. If put to a vote, that majority would douse the possibility of such a county contract. 
“We will not support any expansion of immigration detention at the Douglas County Jail,” the commissioners’ said in a statement urging instead the state’s federal delegation to work toward comprehensive immigration reform. 
 Financial benefit?

The four said their preferred approach “requires coalition-building and advocacy at the federal level, not contracts that perpetuate harm.” They said that “true humanitarian choice is not to detain mothers, fathers and workers” whom they described as “essential” to the local economy.

While the commissioners said they “fully support” holding violent and drug-trafficking criminals accountable,” they said 72% of ICE detainees nationally have no criminal history. “Detaining hardworking and law-abiding residents who have built lives and families here does not make us safer; it only deepens fear, trauma and economic loss across our communities.”
They also questioned any financial benefit, saying the cost to house an inmate at the county jail is $220 per day, an amount they said exceeds the $175 per diem contract ICE currently pays nearby counties.
Hanson, in response, told the Nebraska Examiner that the county is in an “enviable position” to negotiate a better deal. He said the new revenue stream could be reinvested back into his department’s own trimmed budget, offer tax relief and enhanced public safety measures for county residents and potentially create a national model that could direct money to local immigrant communities.
He’s urged the County Board to put the idea to a public vote.
“This should be on an agenda in which people can come and voice their opinion pro or con, and ultimately elected leaders can do what we are supposed to do, make tough choices,” Hanson said.
A county agreement with ICE for detention, the sheriff said, would allow individuals arrested in the Omaha area to stay close to their families and the area’s “premier healthcare system, legal and support services.” 
He cited the June 10 Omaha Glenn Valley Foods raid in which most of the nearly 80 undocumented workers detained were transported roughly four hours away to a North Platte jail in Lincoln County, which has a contract with ICE.
In an Oct. 7 memo to County Board members, Hanson said the county jail had space and was operating at a “historic low capacity.”
 ‘Deeply troubling’

But according to the director of Douglas County Corrections, Michael Myers, the county jail population has steadily increased since late last year. The total incarcerated population as of today is 1,101, up from 914 in December, Myers said in a statement from a county spokesperson.
Douglas County sheriff urges ICE detention contract for jail, County Board chair balks

Projections, Myers said, show the county on pace to process roughly 1,500 more inmates this year compared to last year, when it booked 15,500 individuals.
Two legal centers that advocated for workers detained in the Omaha Glenn Valley immigration raid weighed in Friday on the ICE-Douglas County proposal, one calling it “deeply troubling.” 
“Immigration detention should never be a business model,” said Roxana Cortes-Mills, legal director of the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement. “The Douglas County sheriff’s proposal to profit from detaining immigrants is deeply troubling, especially at a time when fear and uncertainty are already at an all-time high.”
Said Cortes-Mills, “Let’s be honest, this isn’t about access to health care or staying close to family and legal support. It’s about expanding detention in Nebraska and profiting from an administration intent on dehumanizing immigrants.”
She said CIRA attorneys would continue serving communities across the state “to uphold due process and dignity for all.”
 Promote dialogue

American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, which also represents several Glenn Valley detainees, objected to what it called the “illusion” that closer ICE detention facilities would benefit immigrant families.

ACLU executive director Mindy Rush Chipman said that “trying to sprinkle in incentives of money and geographic closeness” is an effort to “hide the ball, so to speak, about what this would actually mean for our communities.”
She said if one asked ACLU’s Omaha clients, they’d likely say it would have been “easier” to have loved one detained closer than North Platte. She, however, doubts those families would support increased ICE detention space in their community.
ACLU believes heavier ICE presence and jail capacity would lead to increased likelihood of “unlawful detentions and liability to the county itself.”
“We all need to push back against the concept this is happening anyway, so we might as well get paid for it,” Rush Chipman said. “This is not good for our communities, no matter if you try to describe and disguise it.”
Hanson sees his proposal as humane for families and a “lucrative opportunity” for the county.
“The biggest thing I’m trying to promote here is dialogue,” he said. “Can we find a way to mitigate the thing that we cannot control — federal detention?”

The State Board of Education was set to vote this week on a controversial measure that many school officials and education advocates say would bar local municipalities from providing much-needed funding and support services to local schools. 
Instead the board voted unanimously on Thursday, at a DEED official’s request, to take no action and return the proposal to the department for further development.

“As a result of the feedback we received, the department will be recommending that the state board take no action on this item, return the proposed regulation to the board or to the department for further collaboration and input with key stakeholders,” said Heather Heineken, the division director for finance and support services for the department, to the board Wednesday, the first day of a two-day meeting. 
The proposal came under sharp criticism and public alarm beginning in June, when DEED introduced the measure as an emergency regulation change. Officials said the move was intended to redefine the amount local municipalities provide for schools — called the local contribution — to include “services provided at no charge to a district by the city or borough.” 
At the time, DEED officials said it was a way to address the balance of funding for schools ↣— in Alaska’s complex school funding formula which includes local, state and federal funding — and avoid failing a federal disparity test. 
The disparity test is required by the U.S. Department of Education to regulate the spread between the highest and lowest funded districts, because of the way the state uses some federal funding, called impact aid. The state failed the test earlier this year, but is in the process of appealing the ruling. 
Education Commissioner Deena Bishop, however, reversed that argument and told board members further discussion was needed with districts and financial offices to clarify what “in-kind” contributions are being made and how they were accounted for. She said that was needed to align with state law and standards for equity between districts. 
“We’re not reacting to the federal government. What we are (doing) is trying to meet the state statute that calls for that equitable funding,” Bishop told the board on Wednesday.
Public raises alarm at unclear change to local contributions
State board members received more than 600 public comments, mostly opposing the measure, in June and July when the regulation was introduced, calling the proposed change vague and potentially limiting vital municipal funding for schools. 
During public comment on Thursday, several district officials expressed opposition and concern.
Valdez School District Superintendent Jason Weber said the change could jeopardize essential city funding, including for transportation and school meals. 
“Our Food Service Program is also at a breaking point. Even after raising lunch prices by $1 per meal last year, we’re still operating at a deficit. Every dollar cut from food service funding is $1 taken away from the plates of kids, these regulations would directly reduce the food we can provide for our students, something no community should have to accept,” he said. 
“Each Alaskan community has unique needs and challenges the decisions about how to support and operate schools should be made by those who live and work closest to them, not through a one size fits all mandate from the state level, undermining local authority threatens the very foundation of community supported education in Alaska,” Weber said.
Juneau School District Superintendent Frank Hauser pointed to the state’s own appeal of the federal disparity test as evidence the change is unnecessary. 
“According to DEED’s July 14 letter, the state would meet the disparity standard, not with a regulation change, which isn’t even mentioned, but by a different accounting method,” Hauser said.
Hauser asked board members to vote the regulation down. 
“I am terrified of version 3.0 of this regulation. Each subsequent attempt at this regulation change has had exponentially more negative impacts, impacts beyond what the department realizes, even to REAAS, home school and correspondence students, instead of enacting the oft quoted definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results, I ask you today to take a different direction and ask the department to stop with this effort altogether,” he said.
During public comment, district officials also raised concerns at a recent DEED Facebook post, which shared a statement over an image of a burning dumpster fire, calling several Anchorage officials’ out by name, saying that their information was “inaccurate” and saying DEED no longer was pushing the proposal. Commenters called the social media post “unprofessional” and not “positive or proactive communication.”
Anchorage officials had penned an op-ed in the Anchorage Daily News, opposing the regulation change, saying it could “gut” the district and strip $15 million in municipal funding, including for school buses and school resource officers. 
State board members vote to return proposal to DEED
Before the vote, several state board members questioned whether the proposal should come back to the board.
“I guess I’m questioning now, is it really an issue, or is that needs to be addressed, or does it just need to go away?” asked board member Pamela Dupras on Thursday. 
Bishop responded that DEED will gather more feedback, and work with districts to adhere to state law and requirements for equitability. She also pointed to the new Legislative Task Force on Education Funding that may take up the issue and recommend new legislation to define local contributions.
Bishop said DEED would work with district officials and finance departments to further clarify the requirements. “I’m glad that you’re pulling this back,” she said. 
She also acknowledged the frustration of districts. “Every two weeks from August until now, I’ve been sharing the same message that, yes, we do not want to put this forward. So I understand the frustration with what was in writing, certainly superintendents that attended all those meetings knew the intent,” she said.

Mike Dunleavy’s re-election campaign in 2022 must comply with a subpoena issued as part of a yearslong investigation, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled Friday.
In a 13-page decision, the court rejected a series of arguments offered by attorneys representing the Republican Governors Association, and it ordered the organization to comply with the subpoena.
The decision was authored by Justice Dario Borghesan, a Dunleavy appointee.
Attorneys representing the RGA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Since 2022, the Alaska Public Offices Commission has been seeking documents from the RGA — a national group that backs Republican candidates for governor — to determine whether or not the group illegally colluded with Dunleavy’s 2022 campaign.
The RGA is considered an “independent expenditure” group and thus is barred by law from coordinating with a political candidate’s campaign. In 2022, two progressive groups filed complaints against the RGA. 
The state watchdog agency APOC, which regulates political campaign spending, began an investigation, but the RGA refused to comply with a subpoena seeking banking information and relevant communications.
Anchorage-based attorney Scott Kendall, who represents the political groups that filed complaints against the RGA three years ago, said that if RGA now complies with the subpoenas, APOC can actually judge the original complaints on their merits.
That could have implications for next year’s governor election, Kendall said on Friday.
“Are they going to participate (in the 2026 election)? If they’re going to participate, are they going to disclose their donors if they participate?” he asked. “What will the public think of them if, in fact, APOC does find that they broke the law? I have to believe the RGA has the intention of trying to participate in this upcoming election, and whether they broke the law last time, and whether they intend to follow the law this time, I think, are very, very relevant issues.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1280273369-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska lawmakers contemplate the need to spend from savings to balance next year’s state budget, a unique investment by the state’s departing revenue commissioner is drawing their attention.
Shortly before leaving office in July to run for governor as a Republican candidate, former commissioner Adam Crum approved a $50 million private equity investment with the firm DigitalBridge, using money from the state’s principal savings account.
That account, the Constitutional Budget Reserve, has about $2.9 billion and until now has been invested in ways that can be easily convertible to cash in case the state needs to spend it on short notice. 
Private equity investments, which typically involve taking a share of a company that isn’t yet listed on a stock market, frequently take years to mature. This is the first time the CBR has been invested in private equity.
The DigitalBridge investment can’t be canceled, said a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Revenue.
Though the investment involves less than 2% of the budget reserve’s funds, state legislators expect to spend — at the least — hundreds of millions of dollars from the reserve next year in order to pay for services and the Permanent Fund dividend.
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said in a written statement on Oct. 3 that they “were caught off guard” when they learned about the move.
They said putting “tens of millions of dollars into an illiquid, high-risk investment” undermines the purpose of the budget reserve, which is to provide stability. 
“Future high risk investments of this nature should not occur without the involvement of the Legislature,” they said. 
Crum’s successor as revenue commissioner, Janelle Earls, was also concerned about the process used for making the investment, said Aimee Bushnell, a spokesperson for the Department of Revenue. 
“After being advised of the acting commissioner’s concerns, the governor apprised legislative leadership of the transaction, forwarded documents to the legislative auditor for review, and directed an outside third-party review be conducted to determine whether there were in fact any violations of policy and make process recommendations as appropriate,” she said.
Crum, speaking by phone on Thursday, said he was surprised by the reaction, in part because he had been working on the investment for more than a year.
In 2000, lawmakers and then-Gov. Tony Knowles created a subaccount within the budget reserve to allow higher-risk, higher-yield investments. That subaccount was drained in 2015, at a time of plunging oil revenue.
The budget reserve’s money moved to low-risk investments, but that comes at a downside; those investments barely keep up with inflation.
“It actually means you’re deteriorating the buying power of the CBR over time,” he said. “And so that actually is a harmful thing.”
Crum said he asked the Department of Law and then-Attorney General Treg Taylor whether he could pursue alternative investments via the disused subaccount.
The answer was yes, and Crum signed a revision to the CBR subaccount investment policy on July 29. He left office on Aug. 8, and the DigitalBridge investment closed three days later.
The money isn’t going to in-state projects, and Crum said he has no personal ties to DigitalBridge.
“In fact, both myself and DigitalBridge would be in incredible trouble if there were any financial ties,” he said.
Crum said that as revenue commissioner, he had a fiduciary duty to make sure the state’s investments were working as best as they could.
“If we can actually make greater returns, we actually can just make sure that we’re building up the fund over time,” Crum said.
Senate President Stevens, by phone on Thursday, said he understands that the investment is a small part of the CBR, but “we’re concerned that we don’t know what’s going to happen in the economy. We don’t know if oil is going to go to zero. It has in the past, and we’re concerned about having the money we need to run government.”
In May, members of the Senate said at a news conference they were worried about a gap between revenue and expenses in 2026 and said that gap could be as large as $600 million.
An unexpected drop in oil prices or production could widen that gap.
Crum said he believes that if the Legislature needs the last $50 million in the CBR, the state will have much bigger issues by that point.
“The $50 million is such a low dollar amount that I do find it amusing that legislators are clutching their pearls about it, because if we somehow burned through $3 billion in savings and we’re down to our last $50 million, we’re dead in the water,” he said. “That is the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. That is not the $50 million that is going to save the state.”
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and operating budget chair for the House Finance Committee this past year, said he doesn’t think the Legislature will need all of the CBR, but added, “I think there’s a greater concern about the fact that we need readily available cash, and that’s what the CBR was designed to provide. And you know, these high-risk investments may not be conducive with that goal.”
He noted that lawmakers have repeatedly clashed with the executive branch in recent years, including on the topic of financial disclosure. In August, legislators overrode Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a bill intended to compel the Department of Revenue to release information related to oil tax audits. The department had declined for years to release that information to legislators.
“It’s just — we’re suspicious,” Josephson said. “We don’t know when we can have our $50 million back.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/230120-Crum-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

(Photo by Ryan Hagerty/USFWS)Alaska judges will not hear a lawsuit alleging that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has mishandled the state’s valuable salmon returns.
On Friday, the Alaska Supreme Court upheld a lower-court decision that dismissed a case brought by Juneau resident Eric Forrer in 2022.
Forrer had argued that years of declining salmon returns in the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers clearly showed that the department was violating a section of the Alaska Constitution that requires fish be managed for sustained yield. 
Forrer, a long-time Alaska resident, has a history of personal-use and commercial fishing, including on the Yukon River. 
In his suit, he sought a declaration confirming that the Fish and Game was violating the constitution and sought an injunction directing the department “to fulfill the sustained yield mandate.”
Bethel Superior Court Judge Nathaniel Peters dismissed the case in 2023, but Forrer appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court.
In an 18-page order published Friday, the five-member court said unanimously that because Forrer didn’t challenge a specific policy, law or regulation, Peters was correct and the case should be dismissed.
If the court had allowed the suit, wrote Justice Dario Borghesan, it would have amounted to “judicial management of the fisheries at issue” and “would be contrary to constitutional design and practically untenable.”
Borghesan wrote that if the court were to eventually issue an injunction, Fish and Game would almost be required to guess what solution would be acceptable to the court.
Forrer was represented by attorney Joe Geldhof, who frequently participates in public-interest lawsuits in front of the Alaska Supreme Court.
By phone, Geldhof said he was disappointed by the decision and begs the question of what Alaskans are supposed to do when a state agency isn’t fulfilling its mandate.
“Where do you go when there’s a systemic failure?” he asked.
Friday’s Supreme Court order implies that if that’s the case, elected officials need to fix the issue.
The Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers have seen severe declines in salmon returns despite restrictions on fishing that are intended to increase the number of fish that return to local rivers to breed.
“The separation of powers doctrine prohibits Alaska courts from reviewing nonjusticiable political questions,” Borghesan wrote on behalf of the court. “A claim is not justiciable if ‘deciding the claim would require us to answer questions that are better directed to the legislative or executive branches of government.’”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/e6332b94-ab76-4b9a-a536-98a0e73dbbfe_1336x1110.png,,,2025-10-10 20:58:19.875421

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)When 11 babies were exposed to measles in Cache County last month, public health workers rushed to get in touch with their families and helped provide emergency medication to keep the infants from getting sick. 
“I was just really proud of the work that the local health department did, and the local health care facilities,” said Amelia Salmanson, an epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS. “I went to bed knowing that we were going to be providing this support to these vulnerable babies.”
Salmanson’s still not resting easy, though. She and her colleagues are anticipating a rise in cases of the highly contagious disease, in Utah and beyond. They’re especially focused on other infants too young to be vaccinated but who may come in contact with the virus in day cares or other settings. 
“I get very nervous,” Salmanson said. 
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Utah has recorded 55 cases of measles this year, with the majority – 41– in the southwestern corner of the state. 
That outbreak along the Utah-Arizona border is prompting local health officials to recommend early MMR vaccination (protecting against measles, mumps and rubella) for babies living in or traveling to Washington County. 
The standard MMR vaccine schedule starts at 12 months old, Salmanson said, but babies are eligible at six months. 
DHHS isn’t recommending early vaccination for kids in other counties, but said it will do so later on if it determines a county’s transmission levels put babies at risk. 
Any children who do get an early dose will still need the two standard doses later on, at 12 to 15 months and then at 4 to 6 years, according to the health department. 
Outside of the southwest corner of the state, Utah recorded four cases in its northern Bear River district and three in its southeast district, along with seven in Utah County. 
Utah County doesn’t have any current cases, said spokesperson Aislynn Tolman-Hill. Still, measles has continued to show up in its wastewater, appearing in its most recent sample from Sept. 30.

While no infants were diagnosed in the county’s outbreak, its health department is preparing for the possibility they’ll be exposed. 
“That’s something that, yes, we definitely are concerned about, with how young of a population we have,” Tolman-Hill said, noting Utah County is one of the youngest in the nation. “Along with that, we are concerned about all of the pregnant moms we have out there in our community.” 
Salmanson agreed. 
“In terms of severe illness and risk for complications, young babies and pregnant women are definitely at the top,” she said. 
There’s some indication those with immunity to measles can transfer antibodies to their babies before birth, Salmanson added, but women aren’t eligible to get the vaccine while pregnant. She recommends that those seeking more information visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s website.

California card rooms emerged victorious in the latest battle over whether tribes should have exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling.


Over the years, casino-owning tribes have spent millions in court, in the Legislature and at the ballot box trying unsuccessfully to force their only competitors out of California’s casino business. 
A judge today blocked their latest effort.
Last year, tribes persuaded the California Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to allow them to sue gambling halls called card rooms over the tribes’ claim that they have exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling in the state.
Since the tribes are sovereign governments, they had lacked standing to sue the private businesses until Newsom signed Senate Bill 549, which gave the tribes one shot this year to resolve their dispute in Sacramento County Superior Court.
Superior Court Judge Lauri Damrell today dismissed the tribes’ case, saying federal gambling law superseded the measure Newsom signed.  
“The court is mindful that previous efforts to resolve this longstanding dispute – whether through regulatory action, legislation, ballot initiatives, or litigation – have been unavailing,” Damrell wrote in a tentative ruling that she approved during a hearing. The court “recognizes the genuine desire, shared by many stakeholders, including the California Legislature, to reach the merits and achieve a final resolution. The court does not take lightly the importance of the issues at stake and, were it within its authority to provide a definitive resolution, it would endeavor to do so.” 
Still, Damrell wrote she was “bound by the limits of federal law.”
California’s card room industry applauded the ruling. 
“We are encouraged by today’s decision,” California Gaming Association President Kyle Kirkland said in a written statement. “Our member cardrooms will continue to support good jobs, vital public services, and local economies across California while upholding the highest standards of integrity, accountability, and compliance.”
Tribes say they strongly disagree with the court’s decision and plan on appealing it.
“This outcome is especially troubling given that it was a state law enacted just last year that explicitly gave tribes standing in state court,” James Siva, chairperson of the California Nations Indian Gaming Association, said in a written statement. “It’s difficult to reconcile this ruling with the clear intent of the Legislature, and once again, a court has sidestepped the actual merits of the case — effectively denying tribes a fair opportunity to seek justice.”
Tribal revenues vs. city taxes
The tribes sued on Jan. 2, the first day the courts were open and the day after SB 549 took effect.
The tribes’ suit alleged that the dozens of gambling halls scattered across California were illegally offering card games such as black jack and pai gow poker that cut into the tribes’ gambling revenues.
“Defendants brazenly profit from illegal gambling,” the tribes said in the opening line of their lawsuit.
Tribes say California voters years ago gave them the exclusive rights to host table games, which they use as a critically important source of revenue to support their historically disenfranchised communities.
Under the bill, tribes cannot receive any money or attorneys’ fees from the lawsuit. Instead, they  could only petition the court to decide whether card rooms can continue to offer the disputed games.
The stakes are high outside of casinos since some cities receive nearly half of their budgets from taxes on card rooms, meaning a tribal victory in court would have jeopardized money for police, firefighters and other local services.
San Jose City Councilmember Sergio Jimenez told lawmakers last year that the city receives $30 million each year from card rooms, enough to fund 150 police officers or 133 firefighters. Jimenez said that money’s in jeopardy if the tribes prevail in court.
The card room industry claims the games are legal and that the attorney general’s office has approved each of them over the years. 
The tribes have tried to sue card rooms for unfair business practices before. But California’s courts have ruled that the tribes don’t have standing.
“There is little doubt that commercial cardrooms are flouting the law by offering illegal games and operating outside the bounds of state regulations,” Siva said in today’s statement. “All we have ever sought is a clear judicial determination on whether these practices are lawful under state law. That is not an unreasonable ask — and tribes should not be denied
their day in court.”
An expensive political fight
The fight over SB 549 was one of the most costly political battles of the two-year legislative session that concluded last year.
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, many of them with large tribal casinos in their districts, pushed for the gambling measure, while a smaller group of lawmakers with card rooms in their districts opposed it.
It followed a failed 2022 sports betting initiative that the tribes spent millions of dollars to sponsor and that included a similar provision that would have let the tribes sue.
The opposing gambling interests donated at least $4.3 million to the 120 members of the Legislature since January 2023, according to the Digital Democracy database.
Facing what they saw as an existential threat, card rooms responded to SB 549’s introduction with a massive lobbying blitz. In 2023, Hawaiian Gardens Casino alone spent $9.1 million on lobbying, the second highest amount reported to state regulators. Only the international oil giant, Chevron Corp., spent more.
Then, despite Newsom signing the law, the card room industry spent more than $3 million in the lead up to the November election in retaliation against four lawmakers who played key roles in the bill’s passage.
Three of the candidates targeted by the card rooms ended up losing, including the bill’s author, Democratic Sen. Josh Newman of Fullerton.
Meanwhile, the tribes’ efforts to push out other gambling competitors from California continued in the Legislature this year. 
The Legislature approved Assembly Bill 831 in September. The measure bans online gaming companies from offering digital sweepstakes that the tribes see as another threat to their exclusive rights to gambling.
Newsom hasn’t yet signed the measure into law. He hasn’t indicated whether he will. He has until Monday to make a decision.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/031423_SoCal-Cardrooms_TS_CM_45.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 19:59:15.411774

(Photo courtesy of Department of Enterprise Services)A Washington man suspected of breaking into and vandalizing the state Capitol is undergoing a mental health evaluation, an attorney confirmed Friday. 
Authorities initially arrested Gunnar McLean Schubert, 29, on suspicion of first-degree burglary, first-degree arson, and first-degree malicious mischief. But prosecutors on Wednesday charged him with only second-degree burglary, a felony, and third-degree malicious mischief, a gross misdemeanor.  
To be convicted of both charges, the prosecution would need to prove that Schubert entered or remained unlawfully in a building with the intent to commit a crime inside, and that he damaged less than $750-worth of property. 
Schubert’s arraignment was scheduled for Friday afternoon, but was delayed a week to allow him to complete his mental health evaluation as previously ordered by the court. His hearing is now scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 17. 
The evaluation will determine whether Schubert is mentally capable of proceeding with his case. If he is found incompetent, he will be admitted to an involuntary treatment facility. 
In a rampage late Sunday night that lasted roughly 10 minutes, according to authorities, Schubert allegedly parked his car on the sidewalk of the campus flag circle, broke into the Capitol through a window, set fire to county, state and U.S. flags and damaged what the state calls the “world’s largest single-loom carpet” that is almost a century old in the state reception room. 
He is also accused of knocking over busts of George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr. and damaging an electronic card reader for an elevator. The card reader has since been fixed, according to the Department of Enterprise Services.
He sustained a cut on his left arm during the incident and was treated by Olympia Fire Department personnel on the scene. His right arm was in a cast at the time. 
Schubert was released from jail on Tuesday, Oct. 7, without needing to post bail. A judge found that bail was not necessary to secure his reappearance at court, but determined that several conditions of release were necessary. 
Undergoing a mental health evaluation was one of those conditions. Another prohibits him from visiting the Capitol campus without an official escort. 
He was also required to contact the court’s pretrial services department within two days of his release, but failed to do so, according to court documents. A violation report has been added to his record, but has not yet been addressed by a judge. 
An attorney representing Schubert confirmed Friday that he is in custody at an undisclosed location while he undergoes his mental health evaluation. 
Schubert’s possible motivation remains unclear. Some officials attributed his alleged actions to mental health issues. 
In videos posted to social media in the days leading up to the break-in, Schubert rambled through sometimes nonsensical rants. In separate posts, he posed with a gun, invoked a Democratic state lawmaker and wrote current events-themed poems as captions. 
Two weeks before allegedly vandalizing the Capitol, Schubert posted a photo inside the Capitol rotunda with one of those poetic captions. 
Schubert played baseball at Gonzaga University and is a former minor league player. 
The incident has stoked concerns of politically motivated violence locally, after the killings this year of Minnesota state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as Republican commentator Charlie Kirk. 
“I take his family at their word that there are mental health considerations,” Lt. Gov. Denny Heck,  a Democrat, said Monday. But, Heck added, “How is it not a political statement to enter the state Capitol building and do damage? He could have entered any of a thousand buildings in Thurston County.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/George-Washington-bust-tipped-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 19:59:15.411774

She said she would issue an order soon.Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whose wrongful deportation from Maryland put a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is currently detained in Pennsylvania. His attorneys have argued the Trump administration is using detention to punish Abrego Garcia because officials are not trying to remove him, even after Abrego Garcia agreed to be deported to Costa Rica.‘Three strikes, you’re out’Xinis expressed her frustration with Department of Justice attorneys for not providing a witness who would give clear answers on how immigration officials were handling the removal of Abrego Garcia. “We're getting to the three strikes, you’re out,” Xinis said. Andrew J. Rossman, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, argued that if Immigration and Customs Enforcement is making no plans to immediately remove him, he should be released from detention. He also argued that since March, when the Trump administration erroneously deported Abrego Garcia to a mega-prison in El Salvador, to the present, Abrego Garcia has been “in continuous containment” way past the six-month limit set by the Supreme Court regarding the detention of immigrants.“The real aim of the government… is punitive, which is just to keep him incarcerated,” Rossman said. ""It's an overtly political purpose.”

Rossman told Xinis that he has not received an answer from the federal government as to why they will not remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, after he agreed to that proposal in August.Xinis asked DOJ attorney Drew Ensign why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica.Ensign said that it was not clear to the government until Friday that Abrego Garcia had agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, because Abrego Garcia had previously expressed fear of being sent there. Abrego Garcia changed his position after Costa Rica assured him he would be given refugee status.“That is a new development that I will report back to people,” Ensign said.Supreme Court rulingA 2001 Supreme Court ruling does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them. After 90 days without efforts to deport an immigrant, a challenge can be made because detaining that person any longer than a maximum of 180 days, or six months, would likely be unconstitutional, the high court found in Zadvydas v. Davis. Earlier this week, Xinis seemed likely to order Abrego Garcia’s release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, where he has remained since late August. Xinis, who also ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garica to the United States after she found his removal to El Salvador unlawful, is overseeing his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention.Protesters rally outside the courthouseAhead of the hearing, dozens of supporters from the immigrant advocacy group CASA gathered in front of the District Court for the District of Maryland, chanting, “Somos todos Kilmar,” or, “We are all Kilmar.” Rallygoers also chanted “What do we want? Justice!” “When do we want it? Now!” Some also held signs urging the Trump administration to free Abrego Garcia.

Two Maryland state legislators, Dels. Nicole Williams and Bernice Mireku-North, both Democrats, joined the rally.Williams sponsored legislation during this year’s General Assembly session to prohibit local police from entering into certain agreements with ICE. On the last day of the legislative session in April, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of a bill that does not include the ban, the biggest loss for Maryland immigration advocates this year.“We are going to be working on legislation with regards to masking by law enforcement officers,” Williams said. “We need to start treating everyone, I don’t care where you’re from, in a humane and decent way. And that’s what we’re going to be fighting for every single day until Kilmar is free and Kilmar comes home. So stop using Kilmar for your own political gain. Bring Kilmar home.”White House involvementSchultz, the DOJ witness, revealed that the White House had direct involvement in picking Uganda as a potential third country of removal for ICE’s deportation of Abrego Garcia. The move was unusual because the State Department typically coordinates third-country removals for the Department of Homeland Security.Schultz said the Homeland Security Council, which operates within the White House, notified ICE of Uganda as a third country of removal. The Homeland Security Council works with the National Security Council of the White House. While Uganda is no longer a third country of removal for Abrego Garcia, ICE is trying to now remove him to Eswatini. Schultz said Eswatini has not agreed to take Abrego Garcia, but discussions, which he said started on Wednesday, are underway. “The discussions are continuing,” Schultz said. Schultz said he is not aware if ICE has not made any efforts to determine if Abrego Garcia would face persecution or be tortured or confined in Eswatini, or be removed a second time to El Salvador.  Eswatini has previously agreed to accept third-country removals from the U.S. and the two countries have a memorandum of understanding, he added.Ghana another potential destinationSchultz said that ICE has also identified the west African country of Ghana as a potential nation for Abrego Garica’s removal. Schultz said once a third country has agreed to accept Abrego Garica, he could be removed by ICE within 72 hours.However, Ghana’s Foreign Minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, wrote on social media that the country will not accept Abrego Garcia. “This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,” he wrote. “In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.”Schultz said that ICE ""prematurely"" sent a notice of removal to Abrego Garcia with Ghana as the designation.The Costa Rica alternativeOne of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, Sascha Rand, grilled Schultz about why DHS would not remove him to Costa Rica, despite Abrego Garcia agreeing to go.Schultz said he was unaware of the letter from Costa Rica’s government saying it would accept Abrego Garcia.Another attorney for Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said that the Trump administration offered to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica in August if he were to plead guilty to criminal charges in a federal case in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration is trying to get him to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses. Rand asked Schultz if anyone from DHS was in contact with Costa Rica.Schultz said he was unaware if there were conversations between the federal government and Costa Rica about removing him there. Rossman said based on Schultz’s testimony, it was clear the Trump administration was “holding hostage passage to Costa Rica.”“They aren’t presently intending to remove him,” he said. “They have spun the globe and picked various (African) countries… to fail on purpose.”William J.

The tariffs would be stacked onto existing tariffs his administration has imposed on the country, he said.Trump added that he would impose his own export controls “on any and all critical software.”“It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,” he wrote.Trump left open the possibility of scrapping or adjusting the additional tariffs before November, saying in the Oval Office late Friday that “We’re gonna have to see what happens.”“That's why I made it Nov. 1,” he said. “We'll see what happens.”He told reporters he has not canceled a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, at an international economic conference in South Korea this week, but raised some doubt that the meeting would take place.“I don't know that we're going to have it,” he said. “But I'm going to be there regardless, so I would assume we might have it.”Tariffs a main part of Trump policyTrump has used tariffs, taxes paid by the importer of foreign goods, as the central tool of his trade policy, applying broad tariffs on U.S. allies and adversaries alike, with a particular focus on China.The two countries imposed escalating trade barriers on one another since Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs in early April. The U.S. tariff rate for Chinese goods peaked at 145% before the two sides negotiated an end to the trade war. Chinese goods still see a base tariff rate of 30%.Trump invoked emergency authority to raise tariffs on China, arguing that the tariffs were a putative measure for China’s inability to control fentanyl supplies flowing into the U.S., but federal courts are still deciding the legality of that move.",,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

The projected $56.6 million state budget deficit was calculated in the October Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and Revenue Monitor report, which the Idaho Legislative Services Office released Friday. 
The Idaho Constitution prohibits the state from running a budget deficit where expenses exceed available revenue. 
However, the state’s top budget official told the Idaho Capital Sun late Friday afternoon that Gov. Brad Little will do what needs to be done to ensure the fiscal year 2026 budget balances. 
Little already ordered all state agencies – other than public schools – to cut their budgets by 3% before the end of the fiscal year June 30. A short time later, Little said those cuts will continue into 2027 and be made permanent. 
No decisions have been made, but state officials are discussing the possibility of additional cuts and deeper cuts, said Lori Wolff, administrator of the Idaho Division of Financial Management.
“Obviously we are watching this very closely and talking amongst the governor’s office staff about what we need to do to make sure we submit a balanced budget,” Wolff said. “We’ve already done the 3% holdbacks and are starting to examine other places where we may need to reduce expenses.”
 Through first quarter of fiscal year 2026 budget, revenue is 6.8% below forecast

Wolff said budget officials will brief Little this month and then he will prepare his gubernatorial budget request in November. 
Wolff said Little and the Division of Financial Management are committed to doing what it takes to avoid a budget deficit of any kind.
“We are continuing to watch revenues and make decisions to make sure whatever we submit is a balanced budget,” Wolff said. “At the same time we don’t want to overreact. This may correct itself, and we definitely don’t want to put too much weight into one month of revenue.”

Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30. The October budget and revenue report covers the first three months – or first quarter – of the current fiscal year 2026.
In simple terms, revenue is the amount of money available to spend on expenses in the state budget. The largest source of revenue is taxes.
Through the first three months of fiscal year 2026, revenues have come in $94.1 million, or 6.8%, below the revised revenue forecast issued by the Division of Financial Management, the new budget and revenue monitor report shows.
The revenue shortfalls are occurring after the Idaho Legislature and Little reduced revenue by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session to pay for tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for eligible education expenses, including tuition at private religious schools.
 Idaho’s budget picture has changed since record surplus three years ago

News of a projected budget deficit is a big change for Idaho. 
A little over three years ago, Idaho ended fiscal year 2022 with a record state budget surplus estimated at $2 billion. 
The budget picture has even changed considerably since legislators adjourned the 2025 legislative session April 4, when they projected ending fiscal year 2026 with a positive ending balance of $439.8 million. 
But in the six months since legislators adjourned the session, that $439.8 million surplus has now become a projected deficit of $56.6 million, according to the October Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and Revenue Monitor report.
Wolff emphasized that the state’s overall economy remains strong and rainy day budget reserve accounts are sitting at record levels. Wolff also pointed out that Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth announced Thursday that the financial investor services firm Moody’s Ratings just affirmed Idaho’s AAA credit rating.
Idaho is not the only state grappling with revenue shortfalls. The Colorado Legislature called a special legislative session this summer, in part to address shrinking revenue, Colorado Newsline reported. Meanwhile, the Washington State Standard reported that state tax revenue in Washington is down by $500 million.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Dozens of Arkansas municipalities will continue to go without certain monthly allotments of state funds because they haven’t yet filed required audits of their water and sewer systems.
After a two-hour debate Friday, Arkansas lawmakers on the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee rejected a proposal to expunge a July vote to withhold “turnback funds” from 43 cities and towns whose 2022 water and sewer audits were outstanding at the time.
Seven legislators voted for the motion while eight voted against it and five voted present. Several members of the 35-member committee were absent.
The committee voted last month to give grace to the 40 cities and towns that still had not submitted their reports for fiscal years 2022 through 2024. Three cities had filed those reports, and two more had done so as of Friday, said Rep. Richard Womack, R-Arkadelphia, House chair of the committee’s Counties and Municipalities subcommittee.
The committee’s September vote asked Treasurer John Thurston to release the funds and require each municipality to provide the delinquent report to Arkansas Legislative Audit or an engagement letter with a certified public accountant promising the report will be submitted by Dec. 31.
However, that vote had no legal authority, according to an opinion issued Monday by Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office. Thurston’s office requested the opinion after the committee’s vote in September. The opinion stated that only expunging the initial vote to withhold funds would allow Thurston to release them.

2025-096 
Act 453 of 2023 states that lawmakers can ask the state treasurer to withhold the funds if a municipality misses the 18-month deadline and that the funds can only be restored if the municipality submits all its reports through the most recent fiscal year.
If those audits are not submitted, the committee may — but is not required to — direct the state treasurer to withhold turnback funds until the reports are submitted. However, once the treasurer is directed to withhold the funds, it is required to do so, Assistant Attorney General William Olson wrote in Monday’s opinion.

Rep. Jack Ladyman, R-Jonesboro, proposed the failed motion to expunge the July vote. He insisted that the opinion “is not law until it goes to court and is proven in court” and that lawmakers do not have to take action that aligns with it even though he agreed with it.
Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, proposed that the committee release the turnback funds to municipalities “that are actively showing efforts” to submit their outstanding audit reports but to continue withholding funds from those that “have produced no evidence of actively complying with the law.”
Thirteen municipalities have shown no effort to submit their reports, said the committee’s House chair, Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs.
“I’m struggling between grace, mercy and rewarding effort, but not rewarding those who are blatantly disregarding the law, because I think that is an injustice to the cities that have gotten the message and are making an effort,” Hammer said.
The committee rejected Hammer’s motion, which also would have required representatives of the noncompliant municipalities to appear before the committee at its next meeting. The motion failed by a similar margin as Ladyman’s.
Arkansas lawmakers agree to return withheld funds to 40 municipalities after two-hour debate

Most of the municipalities flagged for delinquent audit reports in July have populations of fewer than 1,000, Ladyman noted.
“[For] a city of 200 people that has to pay either $3,500 or $10,000 for an audit, that puts them in a bad situation, especially since they haven’t gotten turnback [funds] for two months,” Ladyman said. “That may be keeping them from complying.”
Local governments receive two types of turnback funds from the state. General revenue turnback funds support basic local services such as emergency response. Turnback funds from state highway revenue go to municipalities and are required to be spent on maintaining roads that are continuations of state highways or former state highways.
Lundstrum reiterated her previous opposition to releasing the withheld funds from noncompliant entities.
“If they have a water and sewer department and you don’t pay your water bill, what happens?” she said. “You get your water cut off. At some point, they’ve got to be able to do an audit.”

Last month, Roshani, an Afghan case worker in Vermont, heard that her clients with Special Immigrant Visas would be losing access to food stamps. 
It has been a hard message to explain to them, she said.
It’s not just that her clients come to Vermont with few or no resources, said Roshani, whose real name is being withheld while she seeks asylum. Special Immigrant Visa holders are largely Afghans who were granted that status after assisting the U.S. government in their home country before American troops withdrew in 2021. They have come to the state as legal permanent residents. 
But Vermont’s interpretation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s language on the issue renders these visa holders ineligible for food stamps. Advocates are contesting the state’s reading, which they say appears to be among the first of its kind in the nation.
Roshani said cases of this kind make her “want to melt into the ground.” “They tell me, ‘Hey … do you know how I saved my boss in this war?’” she said.
Officials at the Vermont Department for Children and Families said federal law mandated the denial of food stamp eligibility to this group. Following the passage of the Trump administration’s spending bill in July, the state has begun implementing a sweeping set of changes to its version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The wider population of non-citizens has been significantly affected, with 119 households experiencing a partial or complete loss of benefits, according to the department’s most recent estimate.
But for most humanitarian entrants, a green card has been enough to keep food stamp access, due to exemptions in federal law. Special Immigrant Visa holders, who by programmatic design are seeking promised refuge from both conflict and persecution for past allegiance to the U.S., have lost benefit eligibility in Vermont even though most have green cards.
Federal guidance on issuance of Special Immigrant Visas lists one condition as an “ongoing serious threat as a consequence of employment” with the U.S. government or associated entity.
Tracy Dolan, director of the state’s Refugee Office, estimated that there might be 20 or 30 households with Special Immigrant Visas that would be affected by the eligibility change, but expressed some uncertainty around that figure.
A number of legal advocates have called the state’s position on Special Immigrant Visa holders into question, citing laws they said have been unaltered by the new federal budget.
“The part that we disagree with is Vermont’s interpretation of Afghan (and Iraqi) SIVs in particular,” said Meredith Owen Edwards, senior director of policy and advocacy at Refugee Council USA. 
Edwards’ organization argues in its legal analysis — based on provisions in previous laws governing SNAP and federal guidance that has emerged since the creation of the Special Immigrant Visa program — that those visa holders should still qualify for food stamps without needing to satisfy other conditions.
Vermont’s position is different, according to Miranda Gray, deputy commissioner for the Economic Services Division of the Department for Children and Families. The department’s legal team concluded that under new federal law, Special Immigrant Visa holders are not entitled to that eligibility.
“We are feeling confident in our legal analysis,” Miranda Gray said. “We were essentially taking two different laws and seeing where they intersected.”
Molly Gray, the director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, called the state’s implementation an “unnecessarily cautious and narrow” reading that “seems incorrect,” citing similar arguments to Edwards.

For many of her organization’s clients, she said, food stamps are an indispensable part of the transition period rather than a permanent fixture. The changes may also affect her organization’s future plans to welcome more Special Immigrant Visa holders to the state, Molly Gray said.
“These individuals are arriving with no money and the clothes on their backs,” she said. 
‘Leading the charge’
In making these eligibility changes on Oct. 1, Vermont appears to be among only a few, if any, states to withhold benefits for Special Immigrant Visas in particular, according to officials and advocates. 
Agencies in a number of states across the country did not respond to requests for comment on the issue.
Vermont is “leading the charge” on implementing SNAP changes, according to Edwards. “That is one of the reasons it’s particularly important to ensure that Vermont falls on the right side of interpretation,” she said.
When asked for clarification of the state’s legal reasoning, Miranda Gray responded in an email that she was unable to provide more specific information or connect VTDigger with the department’s attorney.
Dolan said that Vermont’s Special Immigrant Visa holders are now subject to a five-year waiting period for SNAP eligibility after arriving in the U.S. Essentially no Special Immigrant Visa holders in the state are currently eligible under that rule, Dolan said, because they would need to have been lawful permanent residents for at least five years. Vermont only began receiving such entrants in 2021, according to Dolan, with few exceptions. 
This five-year bar and its associated exemptions appear to originate in the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act governing SNAP, according to Edwards, which predates the Special Immigrant Visa program by 15 years.
“The rationale for choosing to have one population eligible and another not in this situation is difficult to understand,” Dolan said. “There’s no doubt about that.”
The state has been under pressure to implement changes to SNAP quickly and with little margin for error, Miranda Gray said. In the background, threats of huge federal penalties loom if the state’s “error rate,” or percentage of misdirected funds under the new guidelines, is too high.
“We have to talk about the full picture,” Miranda Gray said.
One of the central shifts in the Trump administration’s transformation of SNAP is a greater financial burden on states as opposed to the federal government. Administrative costs, which used to be shared equally, will now be 75% covered by each state. But perhaps more crucially, the rate of administrative error will begin to determine how much each state will need to contribute to the direct cost of the benefits themselves.
An error rate of 6% or higher, just 0.87% above Vermont’s result last year, will result in the state being responsible for 5% of the program costs — up to $7.8 million in additional fees. Each successive error rate threshold would add another 5% in required coverage.
Miranda Gray said that kind of expense could result in major cuts elsewhere in the program. 
“I think that impacts, as well, how states are making decisions,” she said of the implementation process. 
All parties agree that a lack of federal guidance on the details of SNAP eligibility has hampered the process. Miranda Gray said part of the issue has been significant turnover and organizational changes at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Sonali Samarasinghe, director of the Vermont office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said that communication around those on the margins of SNAP coverage has been hard to follow for providers and recipients alike.
“Everything is a little murky,” she said. “Guidance changes from day to day.”
Roshani said her clients had often received multiple letters, with one warning of a change in benefit amount, and another withdrawing benefits entirely.
Dolan said the state had requested federal clarification around non-citizen SNAP eligibility “pretty early on,” but that some instructions had not arrived on the promised timeline. The alterations began taking effect Oct. 1, coinciding with the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.   
“We would all benefit from more comprehensive guidance,” Dolan said.
‘A kind of betrayal’
Special Immigrant Visas of this type date back to early years in the United States’ war in Afghanistan, when new legislation sought to offer support to Afghan and Iraqi nationals who assisted the U.S. in its missions abroad. The document affords immigrants under these particular circumstances access to legal permanent residence in the United States. 
Afghans who worked with the U.S. have often faced persecution under the Taliban regime. In recent months, Afghan outlets have reported thousands of refugees have been forced to return home from Iran and Pakistan as the neighboring countries cited security concerns and strain on resources.
The vast majority of Vermont’s Special Immigrant Visa population is Afghan, part of a community which is already reeling after President Donald Trump cut federal refugee resettlement programs in January. When the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, it left behind tens of thousands — estimates including open cases have exceeded 150,000 — of Afghans who were entitled to visas as a result of their work.
In the period since official resettlement channels closed, other pathways to the U.S. for Special Immigrant Visa holders became available, most notably through the veteran-run nonprofit No One Left Behind. Vermont, among other states, has therefore continued to receive Afghan immigrants under these circumstances.
“The U.S. government should issue clear guidance to all states confirming that SIV holders remain eligible for nutrition assistance,” said a spokesperson for No One Left Behind in a statement on Friday. “Our allies kept their promise, and we must keep ours.”
Molly Gray said a lack of food stamps could threaten her organization’s ability to welcome newcomers in the Special Immigrant Visa program going forward.
The alliance assists new Afghan entrants with temporary housing, finding work, and a number of other necessities. But, “​​we don’t have any funding to support food assistance,” Molly Gray said.
“Afghans arriving in Vermont are not looking for a handout, they’re already working second shift,” she said.
The alliance’s purpose is not solely to fulfill a promise made to Afghan people, Molly Gray said, but also simultaneously to grow Vermont’s workforce and economy.
Ali Zenie, executive director of Central Vermont Refugee Action Network, said she was currently working with a family set to lose benefits based on their status as green card-holding Special Immigrant Visa recipients. Having arrived in March, the family’s financial situation has been difficult due to medical issues, and they have relied regularly on food assistance.
Because of religious dietary restrictions, Zenie continued, it has often been difficult to accept food in contexts where the family has not been doing its own shopping. The model of food stamps has allowed the family to accept support in a dignified manner that works for their specific needs. While Zenie hopes that an exemption for disability will allow the household to retain part of their monthly allowance, the case remains up in the air.
It’s crucial, Roshani said, to understand the circumstances that brought these individuals to the United States.
“We’re kind of neglecting the fact that we are receiving people from parts of the world that have experienced a lot of trauma,” Roshani said. 
Samarasinghe said that in the context of their life-threatening support of the U.S. back home, these cuts are especially bewildering.
“I think what it means for them is a kind of betrayal,” she said.

The Missoula County Attorney’s Office has charged a 29-year-old man with a felony hate crime after he allegedly assaulted another man in downtown Missoula because he was Jewish, according to county officials.
Authorities are hoping other people who witnessed the assault will come forward with more information.
According to Missoula authorities, at around 1:30 p.m., Tuesday, Missoula Police went to the 1100 block of West Broadway on a report of an assault. Once they arrived there, they saw a man with “obvious injuries” who was bleeding from the face. They received a description of a man who had allegedly beaten the victim, and found Michael Cain not far away.
Based on statements and other evidence obtained by officers, the police believe that Cain had assaulted the victim because he had been motivated by the victim’s religious, ethnic or cultural identity of belonging to the Jewish religious community.

(Photo courtesy of the University of Arkansas)The University of Arkansas Fayetteville is preparing to hang hundreds of donated Ten Commandments displays in its buildings in compliance with a new state law. 
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
According to the law, posters shall be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions to a local school board, building governing entity or the Building Authority Division. Posters that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.
The state has eleven, four-year public universities, according to the Arkansas Department of Higher Education. The Advocate emailed all of them Friday, and the University of Arkansas Fayetteville is the only one that confirmed receipt of donated posters. 
Arkansas school district responses to Ten Commandments law mixed

“The University recently received about 500 donated posters of the ‘Ten Commandments’ and is beginning to install the posters in university buildings and facilities as required under Act 573 of 2025,” said John Thomas, director of media relations and core communications.
Spokespeople for Arkansas State University, Henderson State University, University of Arkansas – Fort Smith, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff and University of Central Arkansas all confirmed they had not received donations as of Friday.
Nate Hinkel, director of communications for the University of Arkansas System, also confirmed no donations had been made to UA Grantham, an online public university based at the UA System’s Cammack Campus in Little Rock.  
Arkansas Tech University, Southern Arkansas University and University of Arkansas at Monticello did not respond to requests for comment by publication. 
The new state law faced its first legal challenge in June when a group of families of varying religious backgrounds filed a lawsuit against four Northwest Arkansas school districts. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks temporarily blocked the law at the four districts on Aug. 4, one day before it was set to take effect. 
The Conway School District in Central Arkansas was later added to the suit, and Brooks ordered Ten Commandments posters already displayed in the district to be removed in late August. 
Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a notice of appeal on Sept. 23. Brooks last week denied the attorney general’s motion to stay proceedings pending the appeal and a motion for a 30-day extension of upcoming deadlines due to two lawyers’ “personal obligations and heavy workload.”
“These excuses do not constitute good cause to stay the Court’s deadline,” Brooks wrote. “The deadlines are perfectly reasonable, and the Attorney General’s Office is not short of staff to litigate this case.”
The state’s appellant brief is due Nov. 17, according to a scheduling order.

,California,2025-10-10 22:06:45+00:00,CalMatters,Why ‘no tax on tips’ may have limited benefits for California workers,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/10/no-tax-on-tips-california/,"Experts doubt the effectiveness of ‘no tax on tips,’ especially for California workers who are facing cuts in other benefits.","In summary
Experts doubt the effectiveness of ‘no tax on tips,’ especially for California workers who are facing cuts in other benefits.


No tax on tips, a campaign promise by President Donald Trump, is now part of the U.S. tax code, but experts across the political spectrum see limited benefits for California workers.
The Treasury Department and the IRS late last month released details of their proposed regulations around the new tax deduction, which Republicans included in their spending bill. 
Under the provision, taxpayers who make less than $150,000 a year, or $300,000 if filing jointly, could deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their federal income taxes, regardless of whether they itemize their deductions. Among the nearly 70 occupations that qualify are restaurant servers, gig workers, barbers, cosmetologists and golf caddies. The deduction is effective starting this tax year and runs through 2028. The public can submit comments to the IRS until Oct. 22. 
Workers and experts who spoke with CalMatters about no tax on tips had more questions than answers, because income tax outcomes can vary significantly depending on people’s circumstances. Are they single, married filing separately or married filing jointly? Do they have kids? Do they deduct mileage or other expenses? Experts also said the provision brings up issues of fairness: Some low-wage service workers will get deductions that workers with comparable wages in other industries won’t get. 
“I would be hard-pressed to think of a stupider tax policy that’s become law,” said Brian Galle, a law professor at UC Berkeley whose focus includes taxes. 
Galle said the provision makes taxes even more complicated. He also said it could lead some employers to cut workers’ pay “by the full amount of tax savings.” 
Meanwhile, polls show consumers are tired of tipping, so they might stop doing so if they assume that all tipped workers will now be able to deduct their tips, Galle and other experts said. 
In addition, for some workers the deduction may not be enough to offset the negative effects of other aspects of the Republicans’ spending bill.
“It’s a bit of a distraction from the overall bill and how disproportionately it’s helping rich folks at the expense of low-income folks,” said Kayla Kitson, senior policy fellow at the California Budget & Policy Center, a left-leaning think tank. “Many low-income tipped workers will likely be harmed by the cuts to health care and food assistance and the failure to extend enhanced premium tax credits.”
What workers think
Dale Randle, a self-employed barber in Fairfield, a Bay Area suburb, thinks he could take advantage of the new deduction. But he doesn’t know how much in tips he will actually receive.
“It’s kind of hard, because everybody doesn’t tip,” he said. “It’s hit or miss, there’s no consistency. I might go a whole week without someone giving me a tip.”
Also, business has been slow since the pandemic’s onset five years ago, because lots of new barbers have oversaturated the market since then, he said. Data from the state confirms that: Barbers licenses issued this fiscal year totaled 42,958, a 33% increase from fiscal year 2019-20. Business has been especially bad in the past several months, Randle said. 
“The benefit of this (deduction) will depend on how good business is,” he said. “Business is slow, so I can’t count on something that’s not there.”
That’s in line with a Yale Budget Lab analysis that not taxing tips may not benefit more than a third of tipped workers because they do not make enough to owe income tax in the first place.
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, Crissie Brown said she makes about $95,000 to $100,000 a year from being a server at two different restaurants in Alameda. She said she’ll probably have to hire a tax preparer to see if she could benefit from the new deduction, but she’s skeptical because she doesn’t believe the Trump administration is “looking out for the working class at all.” 
“With the economy, I still live pretty poorly,” Brown said. “I can’t even afford to pay what I owe (in taxes) now.” She said keeping tips tax-free “sounds good, but I have a feeling it will bite us” in the end.
Only tips that are given voluntarily by customers will count toward the deduction. That means restaurant servers will not be able to deduct service charges that some restaurants automatically apply to diners’ checks. 
California food service workers’ reliance on tips vary. In September, 27% of bartenders’ income came from tips, according to payment-processing company Square, which analyzed payroll data from more than 100,000 employees. Full-service restaurant workers’ tips made up about 17% of their income last month, just like cafe workers. For workers at quick-service restaurants where there is no table service, tips were about 11% of their income.
Trump said he got the idea for no tax on tips from a Nevada restaurant server who complained about taxes she had to pay on tips. The union that represents Las Vegas food and hospitality workers is mostly supportive of the new deduction, though it has some complaints about the details.
As for gig workers, they might see uneven benefits from the new deduction, said Sergio Avedian, a ride-hailing driver in Los Angeles and a contributor at the gig-work blog Rideshare Guy. 
“For drivers, who often rely on tips to offset low base pay, this could feel like an immediate raise,” Avedian said. But he added that the new deduction may not benefit drivers much because he thinks only 15% to 20% of Uber and Lyft riders tip. He said the deduction could be more beneficial for food-delivery drivers, such as those who deliver for DoorDash, while it would probably not help Amazon Flex workers who don’t typically get tips. 
More than 53% of food-delivery drivers’ income is from tips, according to 2024 data from Gridwise Analytics, which is based on information from more than 260,000 drivers. Tips made up only about 10% of ride-hailing drivers’ pay, while for couriers who deliver packages that number was less than 4%.
Avedian also said gig workers have to pay self-employment tax, so that could eat into any benefit of the new tip deduction — again, if the workers qualify for it at all, depending on their income. 
Almost 40% of taxi and ride-hailing drivers nationwide are on Medicaid or receive health care subsidies, according to Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. In California, those drivers could be among the more than 1 million people expected to lose Medi-Cal coverage under new work-hour requirements in the Republican spending bill.
Fairness and other issues
The uneven effect of the deduction will apply to other industries, according to analyses by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, and American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank. Both think tanks criticized no tax on tips during the 2024 presidential election, when both Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris proposed it. They said it has “no other redeeming quality” and that only some low-wage workers will get the tax deduction.
Another way the deduction is unfair is that it has a marriage penalty, said Andrew Gradman, a tax lawyer in Los Angeles County. 
“If two tipped workers are married, they can only claim $25,000, while a single person would get to claim $25,000,” he said.
Another possible problem: Because the new deduction introduces even more complexity to tax law, some workers risk committing tax fraud or being accused of it, Gradman said. 
If someone works for an institutional employer, “they’re going to have accountants who will do the heavy lifting,” he said, and that could help taxpayers know whether they qualify for the deduction. “If you get your paycheck from Patreon or whatever, it’s gonna be burdensome.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/041624_San-Ysidro-Border-Economy_AH_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

(Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s longest-serving death row inmate died this week in a prison infirmary of natural causes, the Department of Corrections said Friday.
Fred Singleton, 81, died Monday, according to an online post by the agency that oversees the state’s prisons. He was one of 25 inmates on death row at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia after executions resumed in September 2024. The state prisons agency, in its statement, did not explain why it waited four days to notify the public of Singleton’s death.

A jury convicted Singleton in 1983 of raping and strangling 73-year-old widow Elizabeth Lominick to death in Newberry County the year before. Officers had arrested Singleton in Georgetown County with her car, her diamond and gold jewelry, and about $100 of her money, according to court records.
However, Singleton couldn’t be executed because the state Supreme Court found him mentally incompetent. In the 1993 opinion deciding Singleton’s mental state meant he couldn’t face the death chamber, justices set the standard still used today for what makes a death row inmate able to face execution.
Singleton didn’t understand that he could die in the electric chair, which was the default execution method at the time. He could only respond to attorneys’ questions with a “yes” or “no,” making it difficult to communicate, his appeals lawyers argued to the court.
Although the court agreed Singleton shouldn’t face execution, justices also decided a judge couldn’t reverse Singleton’s sentence because the court couldn’t be sure his condition was permanent, according to the opinion.
Medication might have rendered Singleton competent, but justices decided officials couldn’t force Singleton to take medicine for the sake of his execution, according to court records.
Singleton spent the rest of his life on death row.
The next longest-serving inmate is Jamie Wilson, whose case also remains in legal limbo because of questions over his competence.
As executions continue in SC, these inmates can’t receive death warrants

Wilson, convicted in 1989 of killing two 8-year-old girls in a school shooting the year prior, pleaded guilty but mentally ill before receiving a death sentence. His attorneys argued during a 2004 hearing that he was incompetent for execution, but a judge has yet to issue a decision.
Six inmates have been put to death since South Carolina resumed executions last year following a 13-year hiatus.

The state agency that administers New Mexico’s food stamps program says as many as 32,000 residents’ eligibility could be impacted next month by new federal rules.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed July 4 contains many changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, but most don’t go into effect until next year or later.
But Nov. 1, the bill will change how energy assistance payments are applied to SNAP eligibility determinations, according to an announcement Wednesday from the state Health Care Authority. 
Before the bill, states like New Mexico would automatically lower a household’s calculated income by a standard amount if the household received assistance from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP. 
With SNAP cuts looming, a growing Albuquerque food line may foreshadow future need

The deduction is important because it affects how much SNAP benefits a household receives. According to the federal Agriculture Department the standard deduction in New Mexico’s, known as the Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowance, is $408. 
However, thanks to the law, that deduction is only automatic for households with members aged 60 or over or those with a disability.. SNAP recipients without those household members will have to jump through other hurdles, including showing utility bills, to receive the deduction. 
HCA officials said the office will provide assistance to recipients with questions about the change. 
“We’re reaching out early so families have time to prepare,”Niki Kozlowski, Income Support Division director at the HCA said in a statement. “If you’re unsure how this affects you, please contact us now, before your next renewal date, so we can walk you through what you may need to provide.” 
The change goes into effect for new benefit applications or renewals beginning Nov. 1. The new requirements don’t affect current SNAP benefits before then, according to the news release.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-1.jpg,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Washington has abandoned its effort to force Catholic priests and other religious leaders to divulge information on child abuse and neglect they learn of in confession.
With a pair of legal filings, the state agreed not to enforce the controversial provision of a new state law that adds clergy to a list of professions that must report to law enforcement when they have “reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.” 
Stipulations filed in federal court on Friday will largely preserve the law, while casting aside the controversial component related to confessions. Catholic bishops and Orthodox churches sued over that element, arguing it was unconstitutional.
The agreements the state reached in those cases reflect the preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge that has prevented the state and counties from enforcing the confessional reporting provision since the law took effect July 27.
Lawmakers approved the law during this year’s legislative session, and Gov. Bob Ferguson signed it in May.
The Trump administration had also weighed in on the case, siding with the churches.
In the case brought by three Catholic bishops, U.S. District Court Chief Judge David G. Estudillo ruled that requiring disclosures on information learned in confession infringed on their First Amendment right to practice religion and would force priests to violate their sacred vows or face punishment by the state.
State attorneys concluded that, given the judge’s reasoning, settling the legal fights now was the best possible outcome.
“It keeps crucial portions of Washington’s mandatory reporting law in place, while also preserving the Legislature’s authority to address issues with the law identified by the court,” Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. 
Catholic leaders and their lawyers celebrated the legal victory.
“Preventing abuse and upholding the sacred seal of confession are not mutually exclusive — we can and must do both,” said Jean Hill, executive director of the Washington State Catholic Conference.
“That’s why the Church supported the law’s goal from the beginning and only asked for a narrow exemption to protect the sacrament,” she said. “We’re grateful the state ultimately recognized it can prevent abuse without forcing priests to violate their sacred vows.”
Mark Rienzi, president and CEO of Becket, one of several firms involved in the case, called the state’s decision to settle “a victory for religious freedom and for common sense. Priests should never be forced to make the impossible choice of betraying their sacred vows or going to jail.”
But a leader of a group that works to assist individuals abused by clergy members criticized the outcome.
“There are some fights worth fighting for. This is one of them,” said Mary Dispenza of the Catholic Accountability Project. “Priests are not above the law. This secrecy or ‘priest privilege’ fails children and keeps perpetrators safe — able to molest and assault children again and again. The federal judge who blocked [Senate Bill] 5375 is putting the law above the life and protection of children.”
Senate Bill 5375 added clergy to the state’s list of individuals legally required to report suspected child abuse to law enforcement or the Department of Children, Youth and Families. 
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
The three bishops filed their lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Tacoma in May, naming Ferguson, Brown and the prosecuting attorney in each of Washington’s 39 counties as defendants. The Orthodox Church in America, along with other churches and individual priests, filed a similar case in federal court in Spokane in June.
Both cases and stipulations are now in front of Judge Estudillo in Tacoma. If he signs both orders, they will go into effect and the cases will end.
The stipulations do not require any action by the Legislature, said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Attorney General Brown. It does not foreclose lawmakers addressing pieces of the law the court found problematic if they want, he said.
Ferguson, a Catholic, has said requiring disclosures about information learned in confession did not give him pause and he was disappointed his church was suing “to protect individuals who abuse kids.” State attorneys consulted the governor before deciding to file stipulations in each case.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, wrote the new law, which represents years of effort to add clergy to the state’s list of mandatory reporters.
“My goal all along with this bill has just been to protect children, and I hope that closing the book on this lawsuit allows for that to happen,” she said in an email. 
“Children need to know that when they go to a trusted adult in their life to ask for help, like a member of the clergy, they get help,” Frame said. “That’s how we break the cycle of abuse and do better by our next generation.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ferguson-clergy-bill-signing-may-2-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington’s new sales tax on services faces a second lawsuit that could undercut the state’s moves to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
A Sequim-based security company is suing to pause the tax on its services that took effect last week. 
Security Services Northwest wants the state’s tax on security services blocked until Jan. 1, arguing its implementation moved too quickly and violated due process. The company filed the 6-page lawsuit Sept. 30 in Thurston County Superior Court, with the state, the Department of Revenue and agency director Drew Shirk named as defendants.
A Department of Revenue spokesperson declined to comment on the complaint, other than to say the agency “is reviewing the lawsuit with legal counsel.”
The law in question expanded taxes on a number of services and is expected to fuel $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1, and over $2.6 billion over four years. Hundreds of millions of dollars will also flow to local governments, as they get a share of state sales tax proceeds. 
Other services covered by the tax law include live presentations, information technology and temporary staffing. 
The levy on investigation, security and armored car services makes up $127 million of the anticipated four-year collections, according to the Department of Revenue. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Security Services Northwest provides security officers, remote video monitoring and security alarm installation. 
Senate Bill 5814, signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson in May, already faces litigation from cable giant Comcast over a separate provision targeting digital advertising services for taxation. Comcast says the statute violates federal law because it doesn’t apply the tax to all advertising services equally.
Late last month, the state filed its response to Comcast in court, disagreeing with the allegations and asking a judge to dismiss the lawsuit. A hearing in the case could be months away. 
The advertising services tax is projected to bring in $475 million to state coffers over the next two budget cycles. 
The lawsuits bring into question new revenue that state lawmakers relied upon to fill a gaping budget shortfall and fund a $77.8-billion two-year operating budget. The challenged law is part of a package of new and increased taxes and fees that Democrats in the Legislature pushed through this year in hopes of raising $9 billion in the next four years.
Over the summer, the Department of Revenue hosted listening sessions with businesses covered by the new taxes on services. Over 90,000 businesses are expected to pay under the law. Companies complained of a lack of clarity on how the taxes would be implemented and the adverse effects on their bottom line. 
Ahead of the law’s Oct. 1 implementation, the Department of Revenue released detailed guidance on companies’ obligations, including on Sept. 12 for security services. Included in the tax are private investigators, bounty hunters, security guards, fingerprinting, background checks, missing person tracking and lie detectors and polygraphs.
Security Services Northwest says in the lawsuit that this wasn’t enough time to “adapt to and implement internal controls and procedures to ensure that proper sales tax is charged.”
Department of Revenue spokesperson Mikhail Carpenter said the state notified all businesses set to pay the new tax via letter or email between Aug. 13 and Aug. 22. Notices of the changes were also issued in late July, around the time of the listening sessions. 
The company also takes issue with the tax itself, calling it a “direct tax on public safety” in a press release. And it argues that security services are being taxed unfairly compared to other professional services. 
“This policy punishes communities trying to stay safe and makes protection less affordable for everyone,” Joe D’Amico, the company’s president, said in a statement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1620-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

But campus was relatively quiet when it went into effect Friday.,"For much of the last two years, tensions have been elevated on the campus of Yale University, where students protested the Israel-Hamas war with signs, flags and encampments.
But the campus was relatively quiet following the long-awaited announcement of a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. A permanent ceasefire had been a cornerstone demand of Yale protesters. 
On Friday, as the agreement took effect, Yale students said they felt a mix of relief and trepidation about how it would play out. Students said that on campus and online, there was little activity from their peers — on either side of the issue. Some advocates said they planned to continue their activism.
President Donald J. Trump brokered the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza after weeks of negotiations and help from Arab and Muslim allies. The war began after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, when militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted over 250 others. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, displaced most of the population of Gaza and leveled vast areas.
The conflict hit close to home for many students on higher education campuses in the United States, and protests have gripped college communities around the country since the fighting began. Yale was no exception.
Alex Greene, a Yale senior and president of the Peace and Dialogue Leadership Initiative — an educational fellowship that takes Yale and West Point students to Israel, the West Bank and East Jerusalem — said he’s not optimistic about peace prospects in the Middle East because the conflict is so entrenched. 
“Some of the underlying problems are still not addressed,” Greene, who described himself as a political moderate, said. As a result, he said, he expects that “pro-Palestinian protests are not going away. It may not be about the war in Gaza, it may be about the West Bank or something else.”
Still, Greene said he’d seen “surprisingly little” online discourse about the ceasefire, except “maybe a few peers” posting about the return of hostages, specifically videos capturing celebrations in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv.
Yale senior Arjun Warrior, an organizer with Yale’s Endowment Justice Collective — which advocates for ethical distribution of university funds, and has recently researched ties between Yale and Israel — said pro-Palestinian student advocates “feel determined” and will “keep fighting.” 
In a text message, Warrior said the collective remains focused on other long-term goals such as divestment from military weapons manufacturers. “I feel relief, but also grief and uncertainty. This ceasefire is far too late and may not last,” Warrior wrote.
Student protesters at the University of Connecticut also said the ceasefire would not put an end to their activism. A group known as UConn Divest said in a statement that it “understands the ‘ceasefire’ as nothing but empty words to refocus media attention.” 
“So long as the people live under the harshest of conditions, we will continue to fight for them,” the group’s statement read.
On Wednesday, the day before the Israeli Cabinet approved Trump’s deal framework, student protesters staged a “die-in,” lying down on Yale’s Cross Campus green holding pictures of slain Palestinians.
Since the ceasefire went into effect, Yale’s pro-Palestinian activist groups have not posted publicly.
Roee Benya, a Yale junior from Israel, said he is cautiously optimistic about the ceasefire. “Obviously this is great news,” he said. “The most important thing for me as an Israeli is the hostages, bringing them back.”
Benya said he hasn’t seen any visible change at Yale relating to the ceasefire, but he said he thought there might be some next week when Hamas is expected to return the Israeli hostages.
“There has basically been a division in the Yale community between the Palestinian and Israeli camps, and it should have never been like that,” he said. “I hope that a ceasefire will naturally enable getting back to the framework of discussing this conflict.”

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) A former Iowa City physician who is suing the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics is now seeking court intervention in a disciplinary case involving allegations of professional incompetence.
In 2021, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Shafik N. Wassef, 42, an Iowa-licensed physician who formerly practiced in Iowa City, with violating patient privacy standards.
A year later, in March 2022, the board amended and expanded its statement of charges in the case, charging Wassef with the added offenses of professional incompetence, practicing in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, and unprofessional conduct.

The board has not publicly disclosed the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges.
In 2024, the board agreed to hand the case off to an administrative law judge. Wassef then sought summary judgment in the case, seeking dismissal of the charges before the planned disciplinary hearing in the case — which is scheduled, according to conflicting court records, on either Nov. 5, 2026, or Nov. 5, 2027.
The administrative law judge denied the request for summary judgment, which prompted Wassef file a petition last month in Polk County District Court, seeking judicial review of the decision.
With that matter still pending before the court, the administrative law judge has agreed to stay any proceedings in the disciplinary case until there’s a court ruling on the summary judgment issue.
In his court petition, Wassef alleges all of the charges against him are “related to alleged violations of federal regulations codifying patient privacy rules.”
Court records indicate Wassef is currently a resident of Florida where he has an active medical license. In his petition, Wassef argues his Florida license will be adversely affected by the pending disciplinary charges if the case is permitted to proceed to a full disciplinary hearing.
The Board of Medicine has yet to file a response to Wassef’s court petition.
Separately, Wassef is currently suing the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, alleging that in June 2018, just before his graduation from the UIHC residency program, he was contacted by the hospital’s compliance office and informed he had “committed multiple violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,” the federal law that includes patient privacy regulations.
The hospital, Wassef alleges, then filed a complaint against him with the state licensing board and contacted the alleged patient “victims” in the matter to inform them of the situation and invite them to make formal complaints with the board.
The lawsuit alleges the hospital’s allegations are false and have caused “catastrophic professional damage in his field that is ongoing to this day.” The hospital has denied any wrongdoing. A trial-setting conference in the case is scheduled for Oct. 22, 2025.

(USDA photo / Christopher Willis)The Montana Department of Commerce is set to divvy out $300,000 in agritourism grant funding following the passage of legislation this session.
The agency is taking applications for the program until Oct. 23 and it’s the second cycle of funding for agritourism in the state, commerce spokesperson Mitch Staley wrote in an email. The funding started in 2023 and was reupped as part of Senate Bill 405, brought by Montana Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, this past session. 
“Especially in some of the more dry land areas, diversifying how they get their income helps alleviate a lot of the risk that some of these farmers, ranchers face with bad weather years,” Zolnikov said during a Senate Finance and Claims meeting earlier this year.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines agritourism as “farm services for recreation (such as hunting or fishing), hospitality (such as overnight accommodations), or entertainment (such as festivals or petting zoos)” which it says generated $1.26 billion in revenue for farms and ranches around the country in 2022. 
This is extra revenue beyond whatever they are generating from farming or cattle ranching operations. America’s farms contributed about $222 billion total to the U.S. economy in 2023.
A new nonprofit, the Montana Agritourism Association, works closely with producers around the state.

“Our work is a producer-led knowledge hub, helping farmers, ranchers and producers open their gates to visitors safely and successfully, connecting them with training, resources and partners across Montana,” said Debbie Queen, an agritourism specialist with the organization. “We focus on three things producers tell us matter most: business fundamentals, safety and risk awareness, and a great guest experience. When those are in place, everybody wins—hosts, visitors, and the local economy.”
A 2024 survey of Montana producers found that 71% said agritourism strengthens their ability to keep working their land, the organization states.
Individual grants are worth up to $50,000, presenters said.
“We’re encouraging projects and activities of all sizes. The intent is to help farmers and ranchers diversify revenue options through a new or enhanced agritourism activity,” Susan Joy, a program specialist with the Department of Commerce said during the presentation. “The grants are also meant to support activities in rural, under visited and tribal locations throughout Montana that will generate tourism revenue for the benefit of your local economy.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/50432161802_dace50f690_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Des Moines Area Community College board officials will consider next week whether to implement a search for an interim president after two of three candidates for the position withdrew from consideration.
Members of the community college’s presidential search committee met Friday to lay out next steps in the presidential search process, starting with questions of whether, and how, to select an interim president. Current DMACC President Rob Denson is set to retire at the end of the year, and two of the three finalists who were expected to come to campus this month for interviews withdrew their bids for the job, the college announced Wednesday.

While no decisions will be made on the search for an interim or permanent president without full board of directors approval, search consultant Larry Ebbers suggested extending the main search into the spring with the goal of starting a new president July 1, with an interim to lead the college in the meantime.
Ebbers reiterated during the meeting that the candidates who pulled out did so for personal reasons, and not because of anything to do with DMACC, and the third candidate told him they would be willing to remain one as the search is extended. He said the mid-year timing of the start date was an issue brought up by candidates.
“Both of them commented to me in their letters of withdrawal that in fact, they thought DMACC was an excellent school and an excellent opportunity, and they were withdrawing for personal reasons only,” Ebbers said.
The DMACC board of directors will conduct its regular meeting Oct. 13, board President Kevin Halterman said, and members will vote on Ebbers’ recommendation to “cultivate additional candidates” and to work with him on an interim president search.
Ebbers said he plans to recommend the board hire an interim president for the period of Jan. 1 to June 30, with the new president scheduled to start July 1. Interviews for additional nominations to the role would take place in late February and early March.
“I’m very comfortable we’ll be able to find a really good president,” Ebbers said. “There’s no question in my mind about that.”
A screening committee of DMACC and other community college officials narrowed down the initial list of more than 50 candidates to six people before handing the names to the presidential search committee to identify finalists, said board member Denny Presnall during the meeting.
Presnall said he was disappointed to hear the now-former candidates hadn’t figured out whether they could make the job work for them by the time they were in the top three, and that the screening committee had eliminated so many people before coming to the search committee.
The presidential search committee can be the group to screen new crops of candidates, Ebbers said, if the board would rather not use a separate screening committee. In searches like this, the initial candidate pool should have a wide range of backgrounds and experience, and Ebbers said that through the first iteration of the search, it’s been made clear that experience in a community college is paramount.
Board member Trish Roberts said anyone who makes it far enough in the selection process should be asked whether they are a “serious candidate,” as it was disheartening to see this happen.
“I understand Denny’s frustration, because we did have good candidates,” Roberts said.

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, urged Senate colleagues to pass a budget resolution to reopen the government and reduce risk of an aviation disaster.","U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Moran, urged Senate Democrats to end the government shutdown that exacerbates the shortage of air traffic controllers. He argued  reopening government would reduce the risk that personnel or equipment failures could lead to an aviation disaster. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Senate's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran sounded an alarm that the ongoing federal government shutdown threatened to break the nation’s “fragile” aviation system.
Moran, a Kansas Republican who chairs the Senate’s subcommittee on aviation, space and innovation, made reference to the Jan. 29 crash of a commercial jet from Wichita that collided with a military helicopter in crowded airspace above Washington, D.C.
“Our system is too fragile, and the stakes are too high, for us to continue operating the national aviation system in the manner we are doing so,” Moran said. “We will reach a breaking point, and this could result in the closing of our airspace or portions of it.”
He said he never found value in government shutdowns and urged Senate Democrats to collaborate with Republicans to pass a short-term budget resolution so people could return to their jobs and government work could resume.
The budget impasse prompting closure of nonessential elements of the government reached its 10th day on Friday.
There has been concern that continuation of the political dispute could undermine operation of U.S. airports. Air traffic controllers and TSA officers are considered essential employees and required to work during this period without timely paychecks. The existing national shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbated by illness of personnel during the shutdown, has been responsible for an increase in flight delays.
“Every day we remain in a shutdown, the air traffic controller shortage gets worse and the strain on the aviation system intensifies,” the senator said in a Senate floor speech. “I hope that this dysfunction we are undergoing … stops before we see dramatic and damaging consequences.”
The U.S. House passed a resolution to keep the government open, but the U.S. Senate hasn’t found the votes to mirror that step.
Moran said failure to “pass a continuing resolution is slowly crushing our aviation system.”
In January, American Airlines Flight 5342 and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter collided mid-air over the Potomac River. The incident near the Reagan National Airport killed 67 people aboard both aircraft, including 64 passengers and crew on the airliner. The jet had departed from Eisenhower National Airport in Wichita.
“We should be doing everything we can to make certain that our air traffic system and the necessary components are in place to make sure that the traveling public has a safe and secure flight when they board a plane in the United States,” he said. “That work is significantly hindered without an open and functioning government.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U.S.-Sen.-Jerry-Moran-aviation-1024x532.png,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

Josh Shapiro's official residence Sunday, is escorted from his first court appearance Monday, April 14, 2025. (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)The Harrisburg man accused of firebombing the Governor’s Residence in April is set to appear in the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas on Tuesday. He faces 50 felony and misdemeanor charges including attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault and related offenses in connection with the incident.
Cody Balmer, 38, last appeared in magisterial district court April 14, where he pleaded not guilty and District Judge Dale Klein denied Balmer’s attorney’s request for bail, citing a danger to the community if he were released.
Court records list the appearance next week as “plea court.” The Dauphin County district attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the proceeding. 
Neither Balmer’s public defender nor the governor’s office immediately responded to a request for comment.
Balmer turned himself in after allegedly setting off Molotov cocktails in the Governor’s Residence on the first night of the Jewish Passover holiday. Shapiro and his family were sleeping inside. No one was harmed, but the Governor’s Residence suffered major damage.
Following the incident, Balmer called police to turn himself in and told a 911 dispatcher that he “will not take part in [Shapiro’s] plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.”
Shapiro had faced criticism for his support of Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by the militant group Hamas, which led to the war in Gaza that has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians. Shapiro also pushed the University of Pennsylvania to quell student protests over Israel’s response.
Shapiro is the highest-ranking Jewish official in Pennsylvania.
Following his arrest, Balmer’s mother told reporters that her son suffered from mental illness, though Balmer denied this at a hearing in April.

Officials with Canyon County announced on Friday that the first section of a new boat ramp at the park was installed. The new project marks the first construction phase of a two-phase process that has been in the works for two years, according to a Canyon County press release. The boat ramp is closed for the season and is not operational while the project continues.
“This has been a huge undertaking and something we are very excited about,” said Nichole Schwend, Canyon County parks director, in the press release. “It’s the first major boater improvement to the park in 30 years.”
The first phase of the project will cost around $600,000, while the second phase is expected to cost around $275,000, the press release said. The project’s cost is offset by two Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation Waterways Improvement Fund grants, which together covered the entire cost of phase one, according to the release.
Schwend said in the release that part of the reason the project took two years to get to this point was to ensure that the new boat ramp would not cause harm to the area or impact archaeological sites.
“Maintaining and preserving the park’s history and archaeology is of the utmost importance,” Schwend said in the release.
Celebration Park, which was established as Idaho’s only archaeological park in 1989, features huge basalt melon gravels deposited by the Bonneville flood that revel petroglyphs believed to be 100 to 10,000 years old. Free guided tours are available during the park’s visitor center hours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Mental Health Department will need an extra $20 million legislative appropriation to cover some costs in the current budget year. 
And in addition to its current state appropriation of $403 million, the agency says it’s requesting an extra $79.5 million in the upcoming budget year. This will cover $20 million in Medicaid matching costs for both the current and upcoming budget year,  $22.5 million in IT software upgrades and $17 million to implement a court agreement to fix the state’s competency restoration system and to cover any related fines for noncompliance.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ $20 million fiscal year 2026 supplemental budget request will cover the agency’s share of Medicaid matching costs, which is the state’s share of the program’s funding. It comes after the agency already received an extra $27.4 million appropriation from the Legislature and as officials continue to cut or eliminate contracts with mental health and substance abuse providers .
The agency was not yet able to provide a number Friday identifying the total scope of these cuts. 
Rep. Carl Newton, R-Cherokee, said Friday he wasn’t familiar with the details of the agency’s budget request, but he’s not surprised that a supplemental appropriation is needed. 
Newton, chair of the House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee and a member of a select committee investigating the department’s finances, said he doesn’t think the Legislature would be opposed to an additional appropriation. 
“We planned on doing a supplemental but we had to make a budget,” he said. “It’s our constitutional responsibility to get (the budget) done by May, and so we get that, but we knew that if they could get a handle on the budget, we’d probably have to add some more to that. But we wanted at least have something to get to them to get started.”
In the tumultuous final weeks of Legislature’s session, deficiencies in the agency’s budget first came to light and led to weeks of investigative hearings, the firing of former Commissioner Allie Friesen and an emergency appropriation so the agency could make payroll. 
Various reports, including from the State Auditor and Inspector and the Legislative Office for Fiscal Transparency, found a pattern of overspending at the state agency. 
In an attempt to right-size the agency’s budget, at least 300 line items, or parts of provider contracts for specific services, had been identified for cancellation or nonrenewal as part of its process to identify duplicative or unnecessary services. 
Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic, appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt, said the cuts “brought spending in line” with the agency’s budget. However, the agency is still receiving invoices for the 2025 budget year. He said that’s a “remnant of past practices” where funding from the current budget year paid for costs from previous years. 
The agency is also struggling to implement a legislatively-approved court settlement that requires the agency to provide improved competency restoration services on a set timeline. The state fell short of the agreed standards during their first compliance check. The settlement sets forth financial penalties for noncompliance.
The Mental Health Department cannot publicly identify a dollar amount for the total scope of contract cuts needed to correct spending until all of these invoices have been received, an agency spokesperson said. 
“Every program has a personal story behind it,” Slavonic said in a statement.  “We understand how much peer support and community services mean to the people they’ve helped. But our responsibility is to fund programs that align with our behavioral health mission, meet statutory requirements and stay within the budget provided by the Legislature.” 
The agency’s contracting process has been “reformed” to ensure a more competitive bidding process with an open request for proposals system, according to a news release. 
“Stabilizing the budget was one of my top priorities, but it’s only part of the story,” Slavonic said. “Reorganization, transparency and meeting our consent decree milestones are equally important. We’re proving that good stewardship and good care go hand in hand.” 
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said she’s concerned by the latest budget numbers provided and wants to be sure what data this budget request is based on. She said she needs a better idea of what the agency needs and specifics of their plan for providers. 
“We need a lot more solidity,” she said. “But mental health care does not stay stagnant, so I mean, costs go up and down based on challenges folks are facing. So it’s going to be very hard. We have to look at averages. We have to look at it over time. So I hope they’re using historic data to help inform them”
Kirt said she would like to take action before session begins in February, potentially through a special session. 
“I would love to do a supplemental sooner because I think if these cuts are about cash flow, we need to take care of that,” she said. “If they’re not willing to do a special session … make it be one of the first things we do when session opens.”

State Superintendent Lance Evans and his executive team made a case at the hearings for their $3.38 billion appropriation request from the Legislature this coming year, while senators subtly signaled their support for the state’s public education system. It could foreshadow a fight between the House and Senate in the 2026 legislative session, as the House leadership makes a full-court press for expanding “school choice” and using public money for private education options.
Over the course of two days, Wendy Clemons, the Mississippi Department of Education’s chief academic officer, and Paula Vanderford, chief accountability officer, gave a detailed account of the public education system’s successes over the past 10 years, including increased graduation rates and higher elementary reading and math scores.
A decade ago, Mississippi had some the nation’s lowest fourth-grade reading scores. That changed in 2019 when the state began making headlines for having the most gains in the country in fourth-grade reading.

ExcelinEd’s senior policy fellow Christy Hovanetz moderated the first hearing on Thursday, and said the state’s educational progress is a direct result of targeted policy decisions and funding investment, such as the 2013 literacy act that established a third-grade reading test and drastically changed how reading is taught in Mississippi. MDE has also pushed districts to adopt and teach using “high-quality instructional materials.”
“Mississippi is a national story,” she said. “Be proud of your success. You have done amazing things for students and your state.” 
But there’s more work to do, officials said. 
The agency hopes to build on the work of the literacy act, expanding it into grades 4-8. Data shows that despite “miraculous” growth in reading proficiency among fourth graders, it’s challenging to sustain those gains through eighth grade. Increased math proficiency, too, is a focus for the education department.
And while the state has ramped up teacher recruitment, Mississippi still faces a teacher shortage. That’s largely due to low pay, Vanderford said. 
Though legislators gave teachers a pay raise in 2022, health insurance increases almost immediately absorbed the extra money. Nearby states also have increased teacher pay in recent years. Adjusted for cost of living, the agency says Mississippi’s teacher pay — at $54,200 — is ranked 46th out of 49 states, as of May 2024.
That means Mississippi, once again, is near the bottom.

Legislators seemed surprised to hear that the agency’s accountability model, the system by which schools and districts are measured, was recently revamped to include more college and career standards and is already being implemented across the state. As a result, Vanderford said, we’ll likely see fewer A- and B-rated schools this coming year. 
That’s not an indication that student learning is getting worse, though. This year, there were some A-rated districts with less than half of students proficient in reading or math. The revisions to the accountability model are in effort to increase those proficiency levels, Vanderford said.
The agency also plans to focus on decreasing chronic absenteeism, which is defined as missing 10% of the school year, or 18 days, in Mississippi. Since the pandemic, those absentee rates have seen a significant uptick, according to MDE data. 
Moving forward, the agency will set up consistent systems for documenting absenteeism, emphasize graduation success rather than dropout prevention and build outreach systems to intervene earlier when students start missing school. 
Those efforts will likely also implement the work the agency is doing to support low-performing districts, especially the four struggling “districts of transformation” that the state has taken over. 
“We have no intention of losing momentum,” Evans said at the end of the hearings. “I personally feel the full weight of everything we’ve talked about. I live it every day, and I impose that on the people at the department. 
“We’re not satisfied with where we are. We’re the type of people who will never be satisfied with where we are.”

Senators peppered the education leaders with questions through the two days of presentations, pressing officials on early education initiatives and what they were doing to help the state’s lowest- and highest-achieving students.
Chairman Dennis DeBar, a Republican from Leakesville, said the committee would likely meet again on Oct. 28. 
“We’re on the right track,” he said in closing remarks. “As we move forward, we are hesitant to make major changes in the way we operate. These minor tweaks are necessary. We’re going to keep pushing you as a department to make these changes. We’re here to work with you and give you the tools you need to support these districts.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/09143236/3X0A1070.jpg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A former senior aide to two state Senate leaders is returning to Annapolis, this time as the new budget secretary in Gov. Wes Moore’s Cabinet.
Yaakov “Jake” Weissmann, currently the vice president of government relations and community affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, will succeed Helene Grady, who announced this summer that she was leaving in October.
While Grady has a more traditional budget background, Weissmann brings a depth of relationships with the General Assembly to his new role, at a time when relations between the legislature and the Moore administration are strained.
In announcing the appointment Friday afternoon Moore called Weissmann “an experienced public servant and one of the most effective policy minds in our state.”
“His deep understanding of the Maryland budget, developed over years in both the legislative branch and in local government, makes him uniquely qualified to lead DBM,” Moore said in a prepared statement.
He went on to call the appointment “critical as we continue to execute on our budget priorities to make Maryland more affordable, competitive, and ensure responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”
At UMBC, Weissmann worked to strengthen relationships with policymakers and secure operating and capital funding, according to the governor’s office. It said he has also served as an assistant chief administrative officer for Montgomery County, coordinating economic development and serving as the direct point of contact for several departments, including environmental protection, housing and community affairs, permitting services, and transportation.

“I am humbled and excited to serve under Governor Moore and to honor his administration’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, even during deeply challenging times,” Weissmann said in the statement released by the governor’s office.
“Working in collaboration with our partners in the Maryland General Assembly, we will ensure the steady management and administration of a balanced budget that delivers for all Marylanders,” his statement said.
Weissmann emerged as a late contender for the secretary’s job. The administration had considered a pool of other candidates including Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard); Deputy Treasurer Jonathan Martin; Rich Madaleno, a former Montgomery County senator who served as vice chair of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, and the current county administrative officer to Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich; and others.
News of Weissmann’s appointment came just two days after Deputy Budget Secretary Marc Nicole was named acting secretary on Wednesday. Nicole will assume that role on Oct. 15; Weissmann is slated to take over as secretary on Oct. 22.
Weissmann holds a bachelor’s degree in social work and psychology from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. He earned a master’s degree in social work from the University of Maryland School of Social Work and later a law degree from the University of Baltimore School of Law.
He also currently serves on the Maryland State Board of Elections, a position he may have to give up as he assumes a job that determines the election agency’s budget.
Weissmann has a wealth of Annapolis experience, including three years as the top aide to two Senate leaders. After seven years as deputy chief of staff to Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., Weissmann took over as chief of staff. He remained in that position after Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) succeeded Miller. During his time as a senior adviser to Miller and Ferguson, he did help oversee legislative efforts on the budget.
Weissmann’s collegial demeanor and longstanding ties to the Senate, and by extension the General Assembly, could be an asset to Moore, who is entering the final legislative session of his first term.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Moore entered office riding a wave of excitement among legislative Democrats who had just finished eight years of partisan conflict with Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. But the relationship between Moore and the legislature has shown signs of strain of late.
Moore’s public positions on issues such as ending automatic inflation-based increases to the gas tax and allowing the sale of beer and wine in grocery stores rankled legislators in his own party. Recent vetoes by Moore, including one on a bill to study the issue of reparations, have drawn open criticism from Democratic lawmakers who are threatening override votes.
Legislative audits are also becoming more critical of Moore’s departments and becoming fodder for public hearings.
On budget issues, there have been frustrations between legislative budget committees and the administration over “miscalculations” including hundreds of millions in underestimated Medicaid costs.
Weissmann’s knowledge of the legislature and personal relationships with many of its leaders could be a balm for Moore’s frayed legislative relationships.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)It’s easy to watch Brad Pitt’s flyline unfurl in a perfect ‘S’ curve over the Gallatin River and know that image has helped feed into Montana’s status as an angling destination. 
It’s more difficult to determine exactly what kind of impact the fishing world has on the Treasure State. 
But that’s what the 2023 Legislature wanted to know when they requested Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks partner with the University of Montana Bureau of Business and Economic Research to estimate fishing’s economic contributions across the state. 
The report by the BBER, published in August, showed anglers contributed more than $910 million to Montana’s GDP in 2024 and supported more than $1.5 billion in total economic output — gross receipts to Montana businesses — across the state, making it one of biggest contributor’s to the state’s outdoor economic sector. 
“Fishing is deeply woven into the cultural and economic fabric of Montana,” the study authors wrote. “This study demonstrates that coldwater and warm-water fishing are not only popular recreational activities but also powerful economic drivers that support jobs, income, and business activity across the state.”
Researchers with BBER conducted their study by surveying a random sample of adults who purchased a Montana fishing license last year. The final dataset includes 1,181 completed responses — a roughly 30% response rate. Results were weighted using FWP license data as well as demographic benchmarks. 
The study splits anglers into warm-water fishing and cold-water fishing and analyzes trip-related expenditures among the more than 450,000 adults who purchased Montana fishing licenses in 2024. 
Data published by FWP show the department issued 180,328 individual resident fishing licenses and 261,734 individual nonresident licenses. 
More than 84,000 residents and 30,000 nonresidents also purchased combination licenses in 2024, which include fishing licenses, but the study focused exclusively on individual fishing licenses. 
Data shows that Montana’s fishing season is concentrated between June and October, though a clear bump in two-day license purchases shows the prevalence of ice fishing in the state.

The survey questions focused on trip-related expenditures including guiding services, equipment rentals, food, fuel and lodging, and modeled the corresponding impact to the local and statewide economy. 
A majority of the angling impact in Montana comes from cold-water fishing — for trout, salmon, grayling and whitefish — à la the classic “River Runs Through It” iconography. 
According to the study, these trips tended to be longer, involve more travel and generate higher spending on lodging, guides and dining. Cold-water fishing also weighted more heavily toward nonresidents, with 86% of nonresidents surveyed indicating they only engaged in cold-water fishing, compared to 52% of residents.

Warm-water anglers, by contrast, seek out fish such as walleye, northern pike, bass and sturgeon. These anglers were “overwhelmingly” Montana residents, fishing often and close to home with spending habits that reflected the nature of their trips — fuel and groceries dominated over guides or rentals. 
The average annual trip expenses for resident license holders was $1,897, compared to $3,923 for nonresidents. 
 Residents spend the most on fuel ($337), accommodations ($331) and retail ($284), while nonresidents overwhelmingly spent the most on accommodations ($1,490), outfitter and guiding fees ($704), and dining out ($436). 
In looking at the difference between the two types of fishing, cold-water fishing trips also correlated with significantly higher expenditures compared to warm-water fishing — roughly $4,900 compared to $380 annually. 
“This aligns with the finding that cold-water fishing more often involves travel and planning, while warm-water fishing more often involves shorter, local day trips,” according to the study.

In total for the 2024-2025 fishing season, anglers spent an estimated $1.29 billion on fishing-related goods and services. 
That spending supported an estimated 15,978 jobs, generated $427 million in personal income, and contributed nearly $1.5 billion in total economic output across the state. 
“Montana’s amazing angling opportunities are no secret, but this research shows just how important fishing is to communities and businesses around Montana,” FWP Director Christy Clark said in a statement.
The ripple effects of the angling economy is similarly distributed between the cold-water and warm-water fishing split. 
Among jobs supported by the fishing industry, 14,355 are tied to cold water fishing, while just over 1,600 are tied to warm-water fishing. 
“Though smaller in overall scale relative to cold-water fishing, warm-water fishing still represents an important source of in-state tourism and local spending — particularly for the anglers and businesses surrounding warm-water fisheries,” the study states. 
While researchers note the methodology of the study means that estimates are likely on the conservative side, it shows the broad importance of angling for Montana and highlights the importance of FWP to manage fisheries and waterways. 
“The impact of angler spending extends well beyond the state’s lakes and rivers,” the study concludes. “Whether through the wages paid to workers, the profits earned by local businesses, or the taxes collected by governments, the dollars spent by anglers flow throughout Montana’s economy.”
Here are a few additional highlights from the economic impact of Montana anglers:

450,000+ Individual Montana fishing licenses purchased by residents and nonresidents. 


33.6% of license holders reported not fishing once during the license year. 


41% of Montana residents who purchased a fishing license did not fish last year. 


7 average number of days Montana resident license holders spent fishing last year.

A particular concern for administrators is a new requirement that demands Medicaid recipients report their work status at least twice per year. A similar requirement implemented in Arkansas led to 18,000 people becoming uninsured.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Health care providers eye collaboration as federal cuts loom.","Lamoille County Mental Health Services in Morristown. Photo via Facebook
This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Oct. 9, 2025.
Area health care providers specializing in treatment for mental health-related issues and substance-use disorders are collaborating to better serve their shared patients, even as looming cuts to public insurance threaten to make treatment more challenging.
Lamoille County Mental Health Services CEO Jennifer Stratton, who has been on the job for about 18 months, said working with other health care providers like Lamoille Health Partners and Copley Hospital — as well as area law enforcement agencies — has been a main priority.
Both Lamoille Health Partners and Lamoille County Mental Health Services serve patients with overlapping health issues. Stratton said she often meets with health partners CEO Susan Bartlett, as many patients have what she calls co-occurring needs, which refers to their intersecting medical problems like substance-use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Lamoille County doesn’t have the “situation table” setups being explored in other Vermont towns — formal protocols for involving various health care, social support and police organizations when dealing with cases where various issues intersect. Instead, the Lamoille Health Collaborative, founded by Lamoille Health Partners to address the increasingly overlapping health issues faced in the early pandemic period, allows organizations to coordinate. 
Lamoille County Mental Health Services fields an around-the-clock crisis response team that responds, alongside police, to mental health emergencies. Many of them occur at Copley Hospital, leading Stratton to work closely with CEO Joe Woodin to coordinate resources.
Between the local Lamoille Health Collaborative, and the Woodin-led New England Health Collaborative — which includes other Vermont hospitals, the Lamoille Health Partners and other organizations — health care providers in Lamoille County have never been so strategically aligned, their executives say.
In one small example of how the health collaborative members look out for one another, the Lamoille Health Partners sold Lamoille County Mental Health Services some equipment for new sensory room equipment.
It may soon be more necessary than ever. 
Last year, Lamoille Health Partners laid off its former director and sold off its two Washington Highway offices to Copley Hospital to stem a financial crisis. 
And looming cuts to Medicaid, passed in the so-called “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” in July by the Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump, would eliminate about $1 trillion in funding over 10 years for the federal program that provides insurance to low-income and disabled people, and children. Those cuts would particularly threaten funding for rural health care providers.
“At Lamoille County Mental Health Services — and I’m sure I’m speaking collectively for all of the individuals who are part of the Lamoille Health Collaborative, because we all work really well together — we want to meet the needs of our community and the individuals,” Stratton said. “If we’re not receiving the funding to do so, we can’t. Most of us are so dependent on Medicaid that it makes it difficult, financially, to be able to continue to provide those services without individuals receiving that funding.”
Bracing for impact
Stratton worries not just about a larger number of uninsured patients but also about the new work requirement provisions included in the bill that demand Medicaid recipients report their work status at least twice a year. A health policy research report from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a similar program implemented in Arkansas led to 18,000 people becoming uninsured.
“Individuals are going to have to be reapplying for their Medicaid twice a year, and I am concerned that there’s going to be a lot of individuals that are going to be kicked off, at least temporarily, for their Medicaid,” Stratton said.
This potential change could mean even those who do continue to qualify for public insurance will face increased bureaucratic barriers and a higher likelihood of insurance interruptions. For patients juggling an interconnected suite of ailments across multiple doctors and specialists, even a brief interruption in insurance can delay necessary and potentially life-saving treatment.
Stratton has started an effort to get Lamoille County Mental Health Services staff trained as Medicaid assessors, which will allow them to have better access to patient’s insurance applications, and has urged her fellow health collaborative members to train their staff members as well.
Copley CEO Woodin echoed that sentiment.
“I think we’re always relearning that we need each other,” Woodin said. “Hospitals, primary care, specialists, home health agency, nursing home. We’re all sort of a team taking care of the same folks, so it’s important that we get along and support each other.”
On the front lines
The ongoing shutdown of the federal government stems from an effort by Democratic lawmakers, including Vermont’s federal delegation, to force Republicans to reverse planned cuts to Medicaid and public option insurance subsidies passed in their bill over the summer. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN on Tuesday he was concerned the proposed cuts could “literally collapse the entire (health care) system.”
At the Johnson Health Center, directors Geoff and Caroline Butler are on the frontline of a system that is already badly frayed, providing primary care with a substance-use disorder focus in both Johnson and Burlington.
“The looming cuts are something that we think about every day over at the health center,” Geoff Butler said. “With the potential of thousands of Vermont owners losing their coverage, it’s a devastating thought.”
At the health center, patients are already being treated for their intersecting medical, mental health and addiction issues, and staff are already trained to assist patients with insurance paperwork, and they have an on-staff social worker. Butler said it’s the material issues — like access to housing, something that no doctor can address — that are the biggest barriers to care.
“I think one of the biggest things though we are seeing lately with mental health and substance-use issues is housing,” Butler said. “We work with the majority of the unhoused population in Burlington, and that housing piece, making sure people are housed through the winter, at least have a warm place to go for the night.”
In a recent policy report from the Vermont Department of Health laying out initiatives for the next five years, the first goal proposed is to “improve the availability of affordable, accessible, and safe housing.” The fourth goal proposed is to “strengthen the capacity of the mental health and substance use services system to support individuals and communities.”
There are already “no great options for inpatient mental health care in Vermont,” Butler said, and long waiting lists for those that are there. Lamoille County Mental Health Services has a handful of beds in Morrisville and Johnson, and a couple of beds dedicated to the needs of patients in crisis.
“The organizations doing that work are doing great work. It’s just so limited,” Butler said.

Florida Open Primaries, an advocacy group working to open Florida’s closed primary voting system, along with the group Open Primaries and its Let Us Vote campaign, says that of the 626 Florida Democrats surveyed, 87% support having the party unilaterally open its primary election to nonparty-affiliated (NPA) voters. Among the 684 NPA voters surveyed, 80% support the proposal.
Florida is a closed primary election state. That means only registered voters from the Republican and Democratic parties can participate in partisan primary elections.  Election observers nationally disagree about how many states are truly “closed” primaries. Ballotpedia says 13 states require closed primaries. The National Conference of State Legislatures puts the number at nine.
Whatever, the survey found that 96% of NPA voters in Florida and 93% of Florida Democratic voters support open primaries.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said earlier this year that she and her staff were collecting information about an open primary to present to party members. The Phoenix reported in July that the proposal was controversial among some Democrats, who feared it would divide a party that hasn’t seen a member of its ranks win a statewide race since 2018.
Jeremy Gruber, senior vice president of Open Primaries, says that the organization conducted the survey of 1,310 Florida voters by itself, without assistance from an outside firm.
The Florida Democratic Party did not respond to a request for comment.

(Photo via Google Earth)Attorneys for Summit Carbon Solutions argued Friday in Polk County District Court that the company’s proposed amendment to its permit for a carbon sequestration pipeline through Iowa should be decided on before a legal case against the permit can move forward. 
The Iowa Utilities Commission approved a permit in June 2024 for Summit Carbon Solutions to build more than 600 miles of a carbon sequestration pipeline in Iowa, with the condition that the company gain permits in the Dakotas before beginning construction. 
The Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, along with several counties and individual landowners, then filed a lawsuit in fall 2024, seeking to overturn the IUC’s permit approval. The lawsuit alleged the proceedings were unfair and that Summit did not meet the definition of a common carrier.

Summit filed a petition with the IUC on Sept. 15 to amend its approved permit. The amendment would remove the condition that required approval in the Dakotas and add several route and pipe-size modifications to the permit. This action followed Summit’s second permit denial in South Dakota and the enactment of a law barring the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines in the state.

Summit also requested the court remand the Sierra Club and landowners’ case to the IUC and stay any future actions on the case until the IUC decided on the filed amendment petition. This was the issue before Polk County District Court Judge Scott Beattie Friday morning. 
Summit’s attorney, Bret Dublinske of Fredrickson & Byron in Des Moines, argued the IUC needed to rule on the amendment petition before the case against the permit could proceed. 
He argued the facts in the case would be outdated once the IUC ruled on the amendment and the courts would be presented with either duplicative litigation or a scenario in which the ruling did not match the most recent version of the permit. 
“It makes little sense to proceed to litigate over outdated facts that are in the process of being amended, and would be contrary to judicial economy to split the Summit 1.0 case in such a way that it may be litigated twice – once for the original permit and once for the decision on the Petition to Amend that permit,” Summit wrote in its request to remand the case. 
Wally Taylor, on behalf of the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, argued Summit did not supply sufficient information as to how the amendment would change the nature of the lawsuit against the IUC’s decision.
“The proposed amendment does not impact any of the issues in this decision,” Taylor argued. “… It does not change the lack of public convenience and necessity, the issue of eminent domain, the damage to farmland … none of the petitioners have raised issues about the route or even impact of the condition on the South Dakota permit.” 
Taylor asked the court to deny the motion to remand the case to the IUC. 
Brian Jorde with Domina Law Group, based in Nebraska, represented landowners in the case and took a similar stance to Taylor, arguing it would make more sense for the case to continue without regard to Summit’s amendment with the IUC, so that the Iowa Supreme Court can give guidance on the carbon pipeline issue.
Jorde said the landowners and affected parties in the case “don’t need to go through eight more weeks of hearings” in the multi-year case for the same “mistakes” to be made by the IUC on the amendment.

“We need guidance from the Supreme Court; frankly, the IUC needs guidance from the Supreme Court,” Jorde said. “Is a carbon dioxide pipeline that you know has no drop off points in the state of Iowa,  does that promote public convenience and necessity? We need the Supreme Court to tell us, or we’re just going to have 15, potentially, other dockets fighting that same issue.” 
Michelle Rabe, on behalf of the Iowa Utilities Commission, said while the IUC believes Summit’s request for remand is, “slightly outside” of how a remand is typically used, she believes there are three options forward, “none of which are ideal.”
Rabe said Beattie could deny the remand and allow the case to continue, in which case it would advance through the courts until eventually the Supreme Court issues what she said could be a “moot order” at that point because the permit might have changed via the IUC proceedings. 
The second option she presented was for the court to grant the remand and allow the IUC to rule on the amendment, in which case she predicted the parties would appeal the IUC’s decision and then the courts would be presented with potentially “parallel” cases. 
The third option, she said, would be for the court to stay the decision and allow the IUC proceedings to play out, so that when that decision is appealed, the two cases can be consolidated. 
“I don’t think there’s a clean way to do it at this point,” Rabe said. “I think what Summit is asking … on the amendment, may not directly affect the bigger issues in the case. I think potentially it could, but we don’t know.” 
Summit to change routes?
Summit’s amendment petition with the IUC, per Dublinske and the filing, does not seek to do away with the IUC’s protections against a “pipeline to nowhere.” Instead of listing North Dakota as the ending point, Summit asks the permit be changed to instead condition pipeline construction to the company’s securement of “access to one or more sequestration sites and permits or agreements to allow it to reach such storage.”
Dublinske said the changes that occurred in South Dakota since the permit was issued, along with carbon sequestration site potential in Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas, are “fundamentally the reasons” the company submitted the amendment and requested the remand in the case. 
Opponents suggested the amendment means that Summit plans to change its original route, which would have ended in North Dakota where the CO2 could be pumped into an underground rock formation. 
A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the amendment “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota.” 
“Our focus is on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” the spokesperson said.
Beattie said he will work to issue an order as soon as possible, though he suspected it would be a “couple of weeks” before he able to issue a written order.

Oct. 10, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAfter the preliminary examination of former attorney general candidate Matt DePerno and former state Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City) kicked off on Thursday, the review of evidence has been put on pause over a dispute on whether a series of text messages should be admitted as evidence.
Rendon and DePerno, as well as attorney Stefanie Lambert Junttila, were indicted in 2023, following an investigation into potential tampering with election equipment following the 2020 election, led by Special Prosecutor D.J. Hilson.
The three defendants are each accused of participating in a conspiracy to gain access to voting tabulators, where a group of information technology experts allegedly performed “testing” on the machines. 
While Lambert Junttila opted to move straight to trial, Judge Jeffery S. Matis of the Oakland County Circuit Court moved for DePerno and Rendon’s case to be remanded to the 44th District Court in Royal Oak for a preliminary examination, where Judge Derek Meinecke is reviewing the evidence brought by the prosecution to determine whether it is sufficient to move to trial.

Although the prosecution planned to reference the text messages on Friday as part of its examination of Ben Cotton – one of the IT specialists who allegedly examined voting machines from Barry, Missaukee and Roscommon counties – DePerno’s attorney, Michael Cronkright, objected, arguing the text messages were privileged work products tied to Deperno’s case seeking a “forensic audit” of election results in Antrim County. 
A human error in reporting unofficial 2020 election returns in Antrim County briefly showed former President Joe Biden had won the GOP stronghold. While the results were later corrected, the error sparked conspiracy theories in line with President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was rigged. 
According to a report from the Detroit News, the text messages at issue were initially raised during preliminary examination on Thursday. The messages stemmed from a group called “Michigan forensics” where DePerno exchanged messages with cybersecurity specialists about unproven theories that technological issues contributed to President Donald Trump’s loss in the 2020 election. 
DePerno’s Antrim County case was dismissed by the 13th Circuit Court in May of 2021 and was subsequently rejected by the Michigan Court of Appeals and the state Supreme Court.
After a bench conference with Hilson and his assistant prosecutor Heather Bloomquist, as well as Cronkright and Rendon’s attorney Camilla Barkovic, Meinecke postponed further examination until both parties are able to file a motion on whether the text messages should be permitted. The court will hear the motions on Nov. 21. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Hilson called the decision to delay further examination “an unfortunate glitch in the proceedings.”
“Certainly we feel very confident about the evidence that we want to introduce, and I understand the due process aspect of it, and we’re just going to go through that and hopefully the judge sees it our way,” Hilson told reporters. “Ultimately, if he doesn’t, we’re still going to move forward, because I still think that our witnesses helped carry this case.”
According to Hilson, the text messages originated from Cotton’s cell phone.
While speaking with reporters, Deperno maintained that the messages were a work product from the Antrim County case, where Cotton had served as an expert witness. He said Cotton had been threatened with prosecution if he did not turn over the messages. 
“They’re clearly work product and attorney client privilege and only Bill Bailey can waive that privilege,” DePerno said. 
Bailey, DePerno’s client in the Antrim County case, died in 2024.
While DePerno has filed campaign finance paperwork to run for Michigan attorney general in 2026, he would not confirm to reporters whether he was once again seeking the position. 
“I’m not saying I am and I’m not saying I’m not,” he said. 
The preliminary examination is tentatively scheduled to continue on December 18 and 19.

(Getty Images)West Virginia pharmacists can now give COVID-19 shots without prescriptions, according to guidance issued Oct. 6 by the West Virginia Board of Pharmacy.
Earlier in the season, prescriptions were required because of a state law that requires pharmacists to have a valid prescription for a vaccine they administer unless the shots are on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s list of recommended vaccines.
The CDC panel met Sept. 19. On Oct. 6, the agency officially adopted the panel’s recommendations that vaccinating everyone aged six months and up be determined by individual decision-making.
Some pharmacies, including Walgreens locations in the state, have been administering the vaccines with no prescription for longer. A Walgreen’s spokeswoman said the pharmacy began offering the shot with no prescription on Sept. 12. 
According to the state Board of Pharmacy: People over age 65 years and those with conditions that put them at increased risk for severe COVID-19 benefit the most from vaccination. Those conditions can include cancer, kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes and other health conditions. 
In the state of West Virginia’s guidance to public health partners, it notes that the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for all adults, including pregnant women, and for children ages 6 to 23 months. People aged 2 through 18 should get a COVID-19 shot if they’re at increased risk of severe COVID, the agency recommends. 
State guidance also notes that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children 6-23 months old and all children who have never been vaccinated against COVID-19 receive a vaccine. AAP also recommends vaccinating children who live in long-term care facilities and those who live with people at high risk for severe COVID-19.

Gov. Phil Scott announced Friday afternoon that he’s creating a new court in Chittenden County that will address the county’s backlog in legal cases by trying repeat offenders. 
The new court, called The Community Accountability Court, is part of Scott’s “response to increased concerns about quality of life crimes and disorder in Burlington,” according to a press release from his office. 
The initiative comes about a month after Scott declared he had a plan to address public safety concerns, many related to drug use, in the Queen City. Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak previously claimed that Scott wasn’t doing enough to help the city combat persistent social and economic challenges.

The new court will target additional resources for three to four months toward trying repeat offenders who have many pending legal cases against them, the press release said. It’s part of a multi-step plan Scott plans to roll out in the coming days. 
“These additional resources for the Chittenden County Superior Court will help alleviate the backlog, ensure people receive a trial, and provide the kind of immediate follow up that is necessary for (Burlington Police Department)’s enforcement activities to be most effective,” Mulvaney-Stanak said in the governor’s release. 
She and Scott are discussing immediate solutions, like the new court, as well as long-term strategies, Mulvaney-Stanak said in the release. 
Chittenden County Criminal Court, from July through September of this year, has seen a large uptick in criminal cases, Defender General Matt Valerio told a legislative committee Thursday. Public defenders in the county are handling a 37% increase in criminal cases compared to the same quarter of last year, he said. 
That’s a big issue because 39% of total legal cases in the state come from Chittenden County, Valerio said. So when that county’s courts are backed up, it has a really outsized impact on the state, he said. 
In Vermont criminal court, public defenders represent over 90% of people accused, Valerio said in an interview. That makes their caseload pretty representative of how many cases the courts are handling more broadly. 
A dedicated judge will be appointed by the judiciary to oversee the new court, and Scott will select a prosecutor to handle the cases litigated within it, the release said. 
This story will be updated.

Janet Mills is urging Maine voters to reject the referendum question on the Nov. 4th ballot initiative that aims to require voters to show identification at the polls. “Our elections are already safe, secure, and trustworthy,” Mills said in her weekly radio address Friday. “Let’s not make it harder for Maine people to exercise […]","Voting at the Portland Expo on Tuesday was steady and smooth, said poll workers. (Emma Davis/Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills is urging Maine voters to reject the referendum question on the Nov. 4th ballot initiative that aims to require voters to show identification at the polls.
“Our elections are already safe, secure, and trustworthy,” Mills said in her weekly radio address Friday. “Let’s not make it harder for Maine people to exercise that important freedom. Reject Question 1 at the ballot box on November 4th.”
The campaign for this referendum question was launched in April 2024 by the Dinner Table PAC as an effort to require voters to show photo identification at polling places. The submitted proposal also seeks to modify a variety of election laws including absentee voting, according to the official five-page petition submitted to the state in January. 
Though there was pushback on the wording from the campaign and its proponents, Maine’s highest court gave it the OK in mid-July. 
Mills argued that the changes proposed in Question 1 would make it harder for seniors, people with disabilities, rural residents, first responders and workers with unpredictable schedules to vote by banning pre-paid return postage for absentee ballots and prohibiting voters from requesting absentee ballots by phone or through family members.
The proposal also seeks to repeal the current provision in statute allowing immediate family members to drop off ballots for each other. It also wants to roll back ongoing absentee voting, which allows voters to have absentee ballots mailed to them automatically for each election cycle. This option was implemented last February for voters over the age of 65 who self-identify as having a disability.
Additionally, the petition would remove the option for municipalities to get approval for multiple ballot drop boxes, instead requiring them to only have one. 
The petition also seeks to change the process for challenging someone’s right to vote. Under current law, it is up to a challenger to prove that someone doesn’t have the right to vote in a certain election. Challenged voters may still cast a ballot, but it is marked as being challenged so that it can be reviewed in the event of a close race.
“Whether you vote in person or by absentee ballot, you can trust that your vote will be counted fairly,” Mills said. “But that fundamental right to vote is under attack from Question 1.”
The democratic governor, who is poised to announce a run for U.S. Senate to challenge Republican Susan Collins, has also come out against Question 2 on the November ballot, which seeks to implement a red flag law.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A white banner spanning the width of the Chartercare Foundation’s website declares its independence from the similarly named Chartercare Health Partners.
“To our Supporters and Clients: The recent notification of bankruptcy for Chartercare Health Partners does not apply to the Foundation,” the notice reads. “We are a separate and distinct 501(3) community foundation and have been since our inception in 2014.”
And yet, the prospective buyer for Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence, is looking to the charitable foundation to help finance the purchase of the struggling hospitals that the nonprofit was created to support, as first reported by The Providence Journal.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for The Centurion Foundation, confirmed the Atlanta nonprofit wants a “return” of donations meant to help the hospitals before they parted ways with the foundation in 2014. 
“As the original donors intended, these funds would be dedicated to supporting the mission and work of the hospitals, to support access to programs and services for our most vulnerable patients, many of whom are [on] Medicaid and Medicare,” Brown said in an email Friday. “The hospitals continue to provide a significant amount of uncompensated care, which these funds would also support. Consistent with our new 501c3 status, we would also be concentrating resources on our community health needs assessment and priority areas, consistent with state health equity initiatives.”
Brown did not specify the amount of money CharterCare Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s local subsidiary, wants from the foundation. However, Brown noted the foundation’s sizable assets — $6.8 billion as of September 2024, according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service. 
Since the split in 2014, Roger Williams and Fatima have struggled to stay afloat under the financial and operational mismanagement of its now-bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings. Meanwhile, the foundation — which has an office in North Providence two miles west of Fatima hospital — has carved out a niche in local health care grants and student scholarships while paying the six-figure salary of its executive director, Paula Iacono, according to tax filings. Iacono, the only paid employee, with a $101,616 salary in fiscal 2023, declined to comment when reached by email Friday.
Like the foundation, Iacono used to be connected to the hospitals directly, helping raise money for their operations and related primary care and specialty clinics, according to news reports.
That changed in 2014, when Prospect bought Roger Williams and Fatima, turning them from nonprofit to for-profit entities no longer able to accept tax-exempt charitable contributions. The foundation split off as its own organization, and Iacono followed.
The pending sale to The Centurion Foundation, if finalized, returns the hospitals to nonprofit ownership — making them eligible to take back the donations made on its behalf through the foundation years ago.
“We believe this development makes a strong argument for returning these assets to their rightful purposes,” Brown said in an email.
Support from lawmakers
Centurion has enlisted heavy hitters on Smith Hill to back up its request.
“These hospitals are critical community assets which need to be preserved, employing roughly 2,400 people and providing essential community hospital services to thousands of Rhode Islanders, including over 50,000 emergency room visits last year alone,” reads the Oct. 3 email signed by Senate President Valarie Lawson, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and 75 other members of the Rhode Island General Assembly.
The email, addressed to Patricia Wegrzyn McGreen, president of the foundation’s board of directors, urges the foundation to consider returning some of the donations received when it was still linked to Roger Williams and Fatima hospitals to help Centurion close the deal.










We believe this development makes a strong argument for returning these assets to their rightful purposes.


– Otis Brown, spokesperson for The Centurion Foundation


Brown said Gov. Dan McKee and local physicians have also “fully supported” its request. McKee’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday afternoon.
Not named among the supporters: Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who has played a key role in reviewing and setting conditions on the pending sale.
Megan Skinner, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said they were “not in a position to comment at this time,” in an email Friday.
Since granting conditional approval for the sale in June 2024, the state’s top prosecutor has kept close watch on the transaction, agreeing to four rounds of revisions to aid Centurion in financing the deal.
Finding investors to back the $150 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds — lowered from a $165 million value earlier this year — has proven difficult. Centurion executives blamed the challenge on the financial conditions imposed by state regulators, which include an upfront cash injection into the hospitals’ balance sheet. But credit ratings agencies may have also spooked investors, noting the “significant uncertainty” in the financial and operational performance of Centurion’s pending bonds in ratings assessments earlier this year. Meanwhile, federal spending cuts are expected to hurt hospitals nationwide by reducing Medicaid enrollment and curtailing state aid and tax breaks. 
But without the bonds — or an alternative source of funding, such as decade-old donations — the sale appears at risk of failure, in turn putting the hospitals in jeopardy. 
The two hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, equal to more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide.
Neronha has repeatedly warned of the cascading consequences if either or both hospitals close, a concern echoed by state lawmakers in their letter to the foundation.
“We are deeply concerned that the closure of these hospitals would cause a significant loss of access to emergency room care, primary care, cancer treatment, behavioral health and substance abuse treatment services to thousands of Rhode Islanders that we represent, many of whom are ill-equipped to find other hospital-based services,” the letter states. “These hospitals are vital safety-net health care facilities, with a large majority of their patients being covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Significant impacts would also be felt by other hospitals in the region and the delivery of emergency services in communities around the state.”
Neronha said in an interview on WPRI-TV 12’s Newsmakers Friday that he expects the bond sale to close by the end of the month.

Biden’s Energy-Efficient Home Credit to End in 2025 After Big Beautiful Bill, Time Running Out to Save $2000.  
WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware homeowners planning to upgrade their homes with new insulation, energy-efficient windows, or heat pumps will need to act fast. A federal tax credit that helps offset the cost of energy-saving improvements is ending much sooner than expected.
The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, originally allowed homeowners to claim 30% of the cost of certain energy-efficient upgrades made through 2032. But under the new One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025, that timeline has been sharply cut short.
Early Sunset, Big Impact
The credit will now expire after December 31, 2025, reducing the available window for improvements from ten years to just three. Qualifying upgrades must be installed and in service by the end of 2025 to count.
The program provides annual credits of up to $1,200 for improvements like doors, windows, insulation, and home energy audits, and up to $2,000 for high-efficiency systems such as heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and biomass stoves or boilers.
“The early sunset means homeowners who were spacing out upgrades over several years will need to accelerate plans,” said Ben Boyce Sr., owner of Aire Serv Heating and Air. “We’re already hearing from homeowners who are electing to try to squeeze in an upgrade before the deadline.”
No Carryover or Refunds
The credit remains nonrefundable—it can reduce a taxpayer’s bill but cannot produce a refund. Unlike before, unused credits can no longer be carried forward to future tax years.
In another change, beginning in 2025, only equipment from qualified manufacturers with a product ID number listed on the tax return will be eligible.
The related Residential Clean Energy Credit, which covered solar panels and battery storage, was also cut short and will now end after 2025, instead of 2032.
Delaware Families May Feel the Pinch
For Delaware and Brandywine Valley families, the shortened timeline could pose challenges. Many households planned to take advantage of both federal and local incentives, such as Delmarva Power’s energy efficiency rebates, to make upgrades affordable over time.
“This was a well-designed, bipartisan incentive that encouraged smart energy investments,” said Evans. “Cutting it short removes an important tool for families trying to lower energy bills and improve their homes responsibly.”
Homeowners can still claim the credit for qualifying projects completed in 2023, 2024, or 2025 using IRS Form 5695.

Cecil Brockman (Photo: ncleg.net)A judge has set bond at $1,050,000 for Rep. Cecil Brockman during a Friday court appearance after he was charged with multiple sex crimes against a minor.
Brockman, a 41-year-old Democrat who represents Guilford County, appeared over video call from a hospital room during his first court hearing. He was arrested Wednesday and charged with two counts of indecent liberties with a child and two counts of statutory rape of a 15-year-old victim, according to a Guilford County magistrate’s order.
Initially set to appear at the Guilford County Courthouse in Greensboro on Thursday, Brockman’s hearing was postponed until Friday after he was hospitalized due to a medical emergency. Court staff informed reporters late Friday morning that the hearing would be moved from 2 p.m. to 11:30 a.m.
Brockman wore a hospital gown and appeared to have a patch on his chest during the video call, the News and Observer reported.
Greensboro attorney Alec Carpenter represented the lawmaker. He told the court Brockman is waiving his indigency claim. Carpenter did not immediately return a call Friday afternoon.
Judge Gordon Miller said the maximum sentence Brockman faced was life in prison without parole, according to the News and Observer.
Miller ordered Brockman not to have contact with the victim and to remain in the state of North Carolina, WFMY reported. If Brockman makes bail, he must wear an ankle monitor.
During Friday’s hearing, Guilford County District Attorney Avery Crump said Brockman met the minor on an online dating app near Atlanta in May. He lived with the teen there, and the two moved to an apartment in High Point in August.
The victim turned 15 in June.
Prosecutors said Brockman tried to track the victim through Life360 on Sunday, sending an Uber to the minor’s location, according to WFMY. After the driver was unable to find the victim, Brockman directed 911 to the location in Davidson County.
Law enforcement contacted the High Point Police Department, who in turn reached out to the State Bureau of Investigation, FOX8 News reported.
Brockman reportedly made attempts to gain access to the victim while the minor was in a local hospital on Wednesday, including attempting to enter a locked room, reports said.
The victim’s phone contained 14 videos, some of which allowed officials to identify Brockman, multiple outlets reported.
Brockman’s next court date is scheduled for Nov. 13.
Following the news of Brockman’s arrest and the charges, several lawmakers — including Gov. Josh Stein, former governor and 2026 U.S. Senate candidate Roy Cooper, and state leadership from both parties — called for the five-term lawmaker to immediately resign.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Sales of Minnesota products to foreign countries fell by 19% over the past year, according to data released Friday by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. 
The steep decline was driven by a falloff in sales to Minnesota’s three top trading partners: Mexico, China and Canada. American consumers and companies are paying 25% to 35% taxes on imports from those countries, and President Donald Trump threatened again Friday to hike taxes on Chinese goods even higher. 
Minnesota has been hit harder than the nation as a whole: U.S. exports overall were up 6% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. 
Exports to Canada — the largest buyer of Minnesota goods — have dropped by 45% in one year. Mineral oil and fuel exports to Canada accounted for more than half of the overall decline in exports, according to DEED. Canada imported 96% less oil from Minnesota last quarter than in the second quarter of 2024.
“Minnesota’s export statistics were particularly sensitive to changes in the oil market this quarter, but overall declines to our biggest export markets illustrate the risk of tariff uncertainty to our economy,” DEED Commissioner Matt Varilek said in a press release.
Excluding mineral oil and fuel, exports of other goods fell by 10%, with machinery, vehicles, optic and medical equipment and some construction materials seeing the steepest drops. International sales of electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals, aircraft, dairy, eggs and honey all increased. 
Minnesota soybean producers are particularly concerned because their largest buyer, China, has not purchased American soybeans since May. (Argentina is filling the gap in the market while receiving financial assistance from the U.S. to stabilize its economy.) Meat exports to China from Minnesota have dropped 45% over the past year. 
Exports to some countries, including several in Europe, are up from this time last year. The Trump administration brokered a trade deal with the European Union in July, bringing tariffs to 15% with some exceptions.

The Essex town planning commission denied a zoning request from the state that would have advanced plans to build a new women’s prison. 
The decision, the latest roadblock in state attempts to build new secure facilities for adults and juveniles, may force officials back to the drawing board as they evaluate how to address ongoing challenges with Vermont’s existing women’s prison, which is overcrowded and in need of significant repairs.
“I’m not against the concept of a prison,” Joshua Knox, the commission’s chair, said at the Thursday night meeting before the vote. But he and other members felt the state was unable to make key promises, such as ensuring public transportation near the potential facility. “I want that to be locked in and decided,” he said. 
All commission members casting a vote rejected moving forward with the state’s zoning request.
The vote may end a 14-month process during which the Department of Corrections and Department of Buildings and General Services considered two state-owned properties in Essex as possible sites for a new women’s correctional and reentry facility.

Women incarcerated in Vermont are currently detained at Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington. But the facility, built in the 1970s, suffers from faltering infrastructure, issues that women held there have said they want addressed. In recent weeks, the prison has hit capacity, with some units holding more women than they were designed to. 
Irene Wrenner, an Essex town resident and a former state senator, spoke at Thursday’s meeting about the importance of constructing a more dignified prison. 
“The showers reeked of human waste and were infested with sewer flies, maggots and mold,” she told the planning commission, describing the South Burlington prison. 
While Essex residents who participated in recent public meetings about a possible new prison have been split on their views, most have opposed building a new facility in Essex.
Haley Sommer, a Department of Corrections spokesperson, said the state was still evaluating the planning commission’s decision and what it means for future plans for a new women’s prison.

New Mexico lobbyists have continued spending at the highest level in at least five years, according to the latest state filings, shelling out more than $230,000 to wine and dine lawmakers, along with other expenditures, over the last few months. 
In total, 140 lobbyists reported $234,000 in expenditures between May and October, including paying for mailers, catering legislative meetings or holding events.
Lobbyists were required Oct. 8 to report their last few months of expenditures and political contributions.
The recent expenditures bring the total spent so far this year to a little over $1.26 million, which is already the most spent since at least 2021, even with two months left in the year. Lobbyists have spent, on average, about $750,000 annually the last four years.
The biggest spender in the latest reporting period, University of New Mexico lobbyist Mike Puelle, reported spending about $38,000 between May and October, including approximately $20,000 alone for a single event: the late September “1st Annual Rivalry Weekend” football game between UNM and New Mexico State University. 
According to Puelle’s filings, he invited state lawmakers, along with the other local and state officials and staff from both universities.

Most of his other expenditures covered catering meetings of interim legislative committees, including ones discussing radioactive and hazardous materials, health care, economic development and more. 
Puelle did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment Thursday about his spending on behalf of the state’s biggest university. He is one of seven UNM lobbyists, according to Secretary of State filings.
While state law requires lobbyists to periodically report their spending, it does not require them to tell the public which bills they’re lobbying for or against.
The Legislature earlier this year passed House Bill 143, which would have required lobbyists to specify the legislation they hoped to influence, as well as their employers’ positions on specific bills. But Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed it, saying that while she supported the bill’s intent, it would impose “an onerous requirement” on lobbyists and their employers and that some of its provisions were unclear.
Recent ProPublica reporting tied the New Mexico governor’s veto to nationwide rollbacks of state-level transparency and ethics legislation. 
While state law does not require lobbyists to specify bill numbers, the second-biggest spender in the most recent reporting period did so voluntarily.
Sarah Hetemi, reported more than $32,000 in spending as a lobbyist for Americans For Prosperity, a conservative think tank founded by the billionaire Koch brothers.
All Hetemi’s spending, according to her filings, related to House Bill 11, the Paid Family and Medical Leave bill. She reported spending money on mailers thanking lawmakers for opposing the bill or criticizing those who supported it. The bill did not pass the Senate.
The biggest spender this year so far is Missi Currier, CEO of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association. According to her latest spending report, she’s reported more than $360,000 in various expenditures.
Lobbyists this week were also required to report their political contributions to candidates or political action committees between May and October. 
The biggest contributions came from lobbyists for oil and gas companies, including $155,750 that Chevron lobbyist Patrick Killen reported spending in the last few months. His filings report a $50,000 donation to the Our Values PAC, a conservative political action committee based in Roswell, as well as $31,000 to the Speaker Fund, the New Mexico House Democrats’ PAC. 
He also reported 12 donations of $6,200 each — the maximum allowable under state law — to elected Democratic and Republican state lawmakers.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana leaders on Friday met with Vice President JD Vance for the third time as they work to secure support for mid-cycle, partisan redistricting. They remained tight-lipped about the meeting’s contents as protesters rallied in opposition. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, called it a “productive” and “fruitful” discussion. He said his caucus hadn’t yet made a choice, but hinted an answer to the redistricting question could come soon. 
“Obviously, the conversation was about redistricting,” he told reporters. “We talked a lot about that — pros and cons — and so, no decisions were made. But we’re going to work on that and hopefully have a decision very soon.”

President Donald Trump is pushing GOP-led states like Indiana to redraw maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House for the rest of his second term. Redistricting is typically only done after the decennial census. 
Indiana’s current map, drawn in 2021, is 7-2 Republicans. Democrats hold seats in northwest and central Indiana
House Speaker Todd Huston declined to talk to reporters but released a statement thanking Vance “for again talking with our caucus members and facilitating an open dialogue on this important topic. It means a lot to us that he is willing to spend time in our state, personally communicating with and answering questions from Hoosier lawmakers. We had another productive conversation today and we’ll keep discussing this within our caucus and with the Hoosiers we represent as we come to a decision soon.”
Upon leaving the Statehouse, Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, shared that he was fully in support of new maps, regardless of consequences or constituent opposition. 
“I would rather be courageous and take a stand and do something that I know a fair amount of voters are going to say, ‘You know what? We’re not going to vote for you.’ I would rather lose my seat than my grandkids lose their country,” he said.
Gaskill said he doesn’t feel pressure from higher-ups. He knew the debate was coming when Texas and California moved to change their maps.
“We ought to do our part … if one side’s fighting the other side can’t be doing ‘rock paper scissors,'” Gaskill said. “You’re going to get run over.”

When asked about the Senate Republican caucus’ delay, Bray said his members like to be “thoughtful and contemplative and understand the issue very well” before coming to a decision. 
He declined to share meeting specifics and didn’t say whether there were enough votes to support new maps. 
“We’ve been working on this for a while, so we’d like to come to a resolution fairly shortly,” he concluded.
Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, offered a more blunt analysis. 
“They don’t have the votes, currently,” she said during a joint news conference with House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta.
“There’s something happening here because (otherwise) the vice president wouldn’t have to come here — twice now — in order to twist some arms,” said GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne.

Protesters bring props to VP’s visit
The Democratic leaders spoke following another energetic rally at the Indiana Statehouse.
Protesters lined the dual marble staircases and filled the space in between, raising anti-redistricting signs and following speakers’ chants. One protester — in drag as Trump — puppeteered drag versions of Vance and Braun, who writhed upon the marble floors.
Some assembled earlier at the library, jeering as Vance’s motorcade rolled in. Law enforcement officers urged them away from the security perimeter.
Other protesters arrived even sooner. 
A quartet of Hoosiers set up a reclining couch early Friday morning on the sidewalk in front of the Indiana Statehouse as a “gift” to the vice president, who was subject to a false claim involving couches based on a passage from his memoir.
Indiana resident Cassie Jackson said she hoped the prop would stop Vance from pressuring state lawmakers further on the topic of redistricting.
“You can have the couch as a gift,” Jackson said. “But please, don’t come back.” 
She said the group transported the couch on a car roof and set it up before lawmakers arrived. The group recounted how one Republican senator, on his way in, privately told them that he wouldn’t be voting in favor of new maps. 
Jackson’s friend was unconvinced, saying, “These guys lie to us all the time.”

“They’re here to be persuaded so they can go back to their constituents and say, ‘Oh, we were going to say we’re Indiana boys and we’re tough. But then JD came in and he told us what’s what,’” Charlie Spears said. “… I can’t believe a guy from Ohio is going to come in here and tell Indiana how to vote.”
It was Vance’s second trip to Indiana in about two months, as the map-drawing push stalled. 
At least two Hoosier congressmen joined: U.S. Sen. Jim Banks, who flew with Vance on Air Force Two, and 3rd District Rep. Marlin Stutzman. 
Vance also met with Braun, who thanked the vice president for taking the time to visit Indiana in a statement posted to X.
“I appreciated the thoughtful discussion about how our state is serving Hoosiers through common-sense and strong leadership,” he wrote. “We discussed redistricting and the importance of ensuring fair representation for every Hoosier. I look forward to continuing our partnership to keep Indiana — and America — moving in the right direction.”
The meeting was scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. at the nearby Indiana State Library. Lawmakers began streaming into the underground tunnels of the government campus center — and underwent security scans by Secret Service agents — just after 9 a.m.

Members of the Braun administration exited the tunnels at 11 a.m. Indiana Senate Republicans began filtering out from their gathering at 12:20, while the House GOP caucus left at 1:40 p.m.
Some exiting lawmakers were enthusiastic about the visit, including Rep. Ryan Lauer, R-Columbus, who extolled Vance’s virtues and called him an “absolutely wonderful family man.”
The vice president last visited Indiana in August to meet with Braun, Bray and Huston and rally support for early redistricting. Neither the governor nor legislative leadership signaled any firm commitment to the proposal at the time.
Later that month, dozens of GOP lawmakers from Indiana’s House and Senate traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with Vance and other federal officials about a variety of topics, including redistricting. Bray and Huston met in person with Trump during that visit.
Braun has since repeatedly floated the idea of a November special session for early redistricting. The next regularly scheduled legislative session will kick off in January, around the same time that Indiana’s window to file congressional bids opens.
Multiple polls — including one released in August and one this week — have found that the majority of Hoosiers oppose early redistricting.

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens (9-1-4, 2-1-2 CUSA) earned their first home Conference USA victory defeating Jacksonville State, 2-0.
 
NEWARK— Amid a black night sky Freshman goalkeeper Sophia Hall was bound to stand out in her vibrant pink kit. Instead, it was her play in goal that caught the attention of the Delaware crowd at Stuart and Suzanne Grant Stadium Thursday night.
The Blue Hens led Jacksonville State by a goal with a little more than 20 minutes remaining in the game. The Gamecocks set up for their fifth corner of the match and booted it to the top of the box. Gamecock defenseman Reina Herndon got a running start on her touch and fired a powerful blast to the top left of the net. Hall leaped and dove through the air to meet the ball stretching her arms all the way out to deflect the ball away from harm.  
The tipped ball hit off the top of the post and bounced back into play. Hall got to her feet quickly to prepare for another game saving play, but her teammates had her back. The UD defense blocked a few Jacksonville State kicks before they could reach the Pennsylvania native in net, helping lead UD to a 2-0 victory against Jacksonville State.
Hall has made an immediate impact for the Blue Hen’s defense 14 games into her blossoming career. In her first season as a Blue Hen, Hall has 54 saves (third in CUSA) and a save percentage of .831 (second in CUSA). She’s been in goal for every minute of every game and recorded her sixth shutout putting her in a three-way tie for sixth in program history for shutouts in a single season.
Hall’s defensive performance was the catalyst for UD’s second goal of the evening. Following the defensive stand, the Blue Hens pushed on the counterattack moving the ball through the left side of the midfield to the right side in their offensive zone. 
The ball reached the foot of sophomore Brooke Vogel with one defender blocking her way. Vogel blew past the defender, set up her shot with the goalie bearing down on her and rocketed the ball to the back left corner of the net. 
Vogel’s third goal of the season provided the Blue Hens a comfortable cushion with about 17 minutes remaining in the game. Fellow sophomore Gabby Riley started the scoring with her second goal of the season in the early minutes of the second half. Riley’s goal came off a corner kick that managed to evade a touch by either team, sneaking through the mass of players into the back left of the net.
The Gamecocks’ led the game with 17 shots — six on target — but UD’s defense was stout, keeping the Gamecocks off the scoreboard. The Gamecocks are winless in conference play this season and hold an overall record of 6-6-3. They’re currently 11th in the conference standings, two spots away from making the conference tournament.  
UD’s win was its first home win against a CUSA opponent in program history. It was also head coach Kelly Lawrence’s 20th win at UD.  
The Blue Hens remain at home for two more games against Kennesaw State and the leader in the CUSA standings, Liberty. As of now, the Blue Hens are fourth in the CUSA standings fighting for a spot in the conference tournament.
UD will need to finish as one of the best eight teams in the conference to make the conference tournament in its inaugural CUSA season.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MR128677-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 15:57:00.367241

Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) tapped Sen. Michael A. Jackson (D-Calvert, Charles & Prince George’s) as the next superintendent of the Maryland State Police Friday, replacing Col. Roland L. Butler who is set to retire Nov. 1.
Before he was elected to the legislature, Jackson spent 22 years in the Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Office, the last eight, from 2002-2010, as elected sheriff. He was elected to the House of Delegates in 2014 and appointed to the Senate in 2021, winning reelection to the seat in 2022. He serves on the Budget and Taxation Committee.
“He’s one of our best members,” Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) said of Jackson’s work on the commitee “I’m thrilled for him. It’s a good opportunity for him. That makes me sad because he’s a really good friend and he’s really good on Budget and Tax.”

Butler took the helm at the State Police in early 2023, shortly after Moore’s inauguration. He became the first Black superintendent of the State Police in the agency’s history.
In a statement Friday afternoon, Moore applauded Butler for 31 years in law enforcement, calling him a “true public servant.”
“During Colonel Butler’s tenure at the helm of State Police, Maryland has become a national leader in crime reduction and public safety gains. He leaves behind a profound legacy as he enters retirement,” Moore said. “And I also know Senator Michael A. Jackson—an exceptional public servant in his own right—will build on the foundation Colonel Butler laid.”
Butler took the job after a lengthy career in the State Police, including time as chief of the Field Operations Bureau. But he faced a difficult confirmation battle, as a group of Black lawmakers argued that Butler had not done enough to promote diversity and address complaints of racism and discriminatory treatment of Black officers.
At the time, Jackson was one of four senators, all from Prince George’s County, to vote against Butler.
Last year, the State Police agreed to pay $2.75 million to settle a Justice Department investigation that found written and physical hiring tests used by the department discriminated against Black and female applicants.
The investigation in that began in 2022, before Butler’s tenure, and the funds were to be divided between 48 failed applicants. President Donald Trump’s (R) administration has since signaled that it intends to walk away from similar suits around the country.
Butler plans to retire Nov. 1, Moore said, and Jackson will take over Nov. 12. Lt. Col. Daniel C. Pickett will serve as superintendent in the interim.

It’s the second time House Speaker Pro Tempore Kate Hogan and Senate Assistant Majority Whip Julian Cyr have filed legislation (S 1504, H 2450) that would phase out the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of chemicals that do not break down fully in the environment and are linked to harmful health issues like thyroid disease, liver damage, some cancers and immune system suppression.
The bills gained favorable reports last session from the Joint Committee on Public Health and Health Care Financing, but died in House Ways and Means Committee last session. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that more than 99% of people in the U.S. have detectable levels of PFAS in their blood, according to Laurel Schaider, a senior scientist at Newton-based Silent Spring Institute who spoke at a State House briefing on Thursday.
PFAS are often used in nonstick, stain-resistant, waterproof and grease-resistant products. Well owners and users, farmers and firefighters from across Massachusetts have testified before the Legislature in recent years and gathered at the State House Thursday to discuss the illnesses and other issues that have resulted from water and soil contaminated with PFAS and firefighting gear designed with PFAS in it. 
“I think there’s two hurdles here. One is that we’re talking about complex policy related to environmental science, and the more that we learn about PFAS, the more we understand its ubiquity,” Cyr told the News Service. “As you build a statutory and then a regulatory scheme around it, this isn’t easy policymaking.”
“We continue to see that the manufacturers of products that contain PFAS have opposed these efforts in numerous states. Massachusetts is not immune from some of that opposition,” Cyr continued. In part that’s why the bill targets specifically how people are most exposed to PFAS, not how it’s present in industrial applications, Cyr said. 
The Legislature in 2024 passed a few measures, according to Hogan, including those phasing out PFAS in firefighter protective gear and increasing funds to MassDEP to provide support for PFAS testing.
Other lawmakers have filed varying forms of legislation this session aiming to address different PFAS-related issues. A delegation of Massachusetts lawmakers visited Maine in August in an attempt to better understand how the state tackled contamination caused by PFAS specifically related to sewage sludge on farms. 
“Massachusetts, we like to be in the vanguard of public health, of environmental health and safety. We are no longer in the vanguard. I think there are 13 or 14 other states that have passed some form of legislation related to PFAS. So we’re losing ground a bit,” Cyr said. 
Alaska, New Jersey and New Hampshire also recently passed laws specifically addressing PFAS used in firefighting equipment. States including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont have passed varying laws phasing out the use of PFAS.
The Massachusetts bill would establish a remediation fund to assist entities attempting to clean up PFAS from their water supply, as well as direct the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to include PFAS monitoring requirements. It’s based on recommendations from the PFAS Interagency Task Force, which Hogan and Cyr chaired and that came out with a report in 2022.
“We’re trying to keep our bill current,” Hogan said, naming biosolids and ambient air as additional PFAS-related issues she anticipates ahead. “What we’ve set forth will really be foundational to moving forward and to dealing with all of the aspects of PFAS that are going to keep making their way into the general public and our conversations about PFAS.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/68e7e4225e6fe.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 14:57:30.273642

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Lawmakers in at least 16 states this year introduced bills to regulate the use of automated license plate readers responsible for collecting large amounts of data on drivers across the country.
But just three states — Arkansas, Idaho and Virginia — enacted laws this session that establish or amend rules for law enforcement agencies using the high-tech camera systems and the manner in which license plate data should be stored. And this month, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have restricted use of such data.
The new Arkansas law, which was signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in April, also allows nongovernmental entities, such as private landowners and commercial business owners, to use license plate cameras on the condition that the data is deleted after 60 days. State agencies and parking enforcement can store license plate data for up to 150 days.
Measures in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are still under consideration. While the Pennsylvania bill outlines a permitting process for state agencies interested in installing license plate cameras, the measures in Massachusetts and New Jersey aim to strengthen privacy protections by ensuring only authorized employees can access driver data.
Comprehensive data privacy laws go into effect in 8 more states this year

Automated or automatic license plate readers, also known as ALPRs, are high-speed camera and computer software systems that automatically capture license plate information as vehicles drive by. These readers, which are typically mounted on street poles or the roofs of police cars, also record the location, date and time that license plates are captured.
ALPRs have been used by law enforcement agencies for more than 20 years. The camera systems are typically used as a tool for traffic accident and crime investigations. 
Despite the technology’s popularity, privacy and technology groups have raised concerns over data storage and appropriate uses of ALPRs. 
License plate readers collect and store large amounts of data, which is susceptible to data breaches and hacking, according to a report from the Brennan Center for Justice. Several law enforcement agencies and officers have also used the technology to target immigrants and could track people seeking reproductive health care, according to an analysis from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group.
Lawmakers in at least 10 states — Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Utah — introduced ALPR legislation this year that didn’t advance.
This month, Newsom vetoed a measure that would have restricted how and when police agencies use and share data collected by ALPRs. The bill, which was approved by the legislature amid reports police were misusing the data, also would have required agencies to undergo random audits by the state and to delete some collected data within 60 days.
In his veto message, Newsom said the measure “does not strike the delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and ensuring public safety,” citing examples of how the bill’s provisions could impede criminal investigations.
In New Jersey, Democratic legislators introduced another bill in June that would prohibit law enforcement agencies and individuals from sharing license plate information during interstate investigations into people seeking reproductive health care services, such as abortion, that are legal in New Jersey.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s fiscal debates usually circle the same questions: whether to cut taxes, which ones, and who pays the price. Lately, rapid growth in residential property values has thrown the property-tax formula out of balance. Instead of commissioning a serious study of how to fix it, some state leaders and candidates have floated proposals to cap or even eliminate property taxes. The idea sounds attractive on paper, but in practice it would destabilize the institutions most South Dakotans depend on: local schools, city services and county governments.
At the heart of the matter is a misunderstanding of the causes of the pain some homeowners are experiencing. There is little indication that total property taxes have taken an inordinate jump in recent years. Instead, an increase in home values has apparently distorted the formula for allocating property taxes between residential, ag and commercial property.
Meanwhile, state government lives mostly on sales taxes and federal transfers. Yet it is state officials and politicians, some with little to no experience in local governance, who are calling for property tax cuts while leaving their own revenue streams untouched.
This disconnect raises a larger question: What kind of reform does South Dakota really need? Businessman Toby Doeden, a political newcomer who wants to be governor, has suggested that he would “DOGE” state government, an acronym for Department of Government Efficiency that evokes the idea of slashing wasteful programs. But while such rhetoric resonates nationally, it misses the mark in South Dakota.
Unlike Washington, South Dakota’s state government isn’t awash in bloated agencies or ridiculous programs. Instead, it more closely resembles a struggling family-run shop: lean, underfunded, reliant on dated systems, and often vulnerable to inefficiencies or fraud. What the state lacks is not austerity but modernization. Outdated processes slow delivery of services. Fragmented structures increase costs. And the absence of coordinated, professional oversight leaves opportunities for improvement untapped.
A more constructive project would look less like DOGE and more like modernization and consolidation. Imagine a task force of seasoned executives from some of South Dakota’s best-run companies taking a hard look at state operations. With a mandate to find efficiencies, improve service delivery, and apply modern technology, such a group could identify changes that truly move the needle. The likely results: streamlined systems, smarter spending, and improved outcomes for citizens.
That is why proposals like Gov. Larry Rhoden’s 2024 bill to cap property-tax growth, which is now state law, or Doeden’s talk of eliminating property taxes feel misguided. These measures target the wrong level of government. Property taxes sustain local governments, which must balance budgets each year while maintaining schools, roads, and public safety.
When Pierre restricts their revenue without offering alternatives, the result is predictable: local officials are forced to cut programs or raise fees, shifting the burden in less transparent ways.

There is, of course, a more obvious option, one that almost no politician dares to talk about. South Dakota has too many governments. With 66 counties, hundreds of townships, and more than 150 school districts, the state maintains a costly system of governments with redundant and unnecessary facilities and employees. Consolidation of counties or school districts could lower administrative costs and deliver services more efficiently. Yet such structural reform demands courage, political will, and a willingness to confront entrenched local loyalties.
For now, state leaders and politicians prefer easier sound bites: cutting property taxes without tackling the underlying system. The contradiction is glaring. While protecting their own sales-tax revenue, state officials are restricting the lifeblood of local governments. The unanswered questions loom large: When revenues fall short, will the state step in with replacement funding? Or will school boards and city councils be left to close libraries, shorten school years, or defer infrastructure repairs?
Perhaps the better path for local government outsiders would be to first gain hands-on experience in local government. Let them run a school district or a county commission, grapple with balancing budgets, and decide which programs to cut when dollars run thin. Only then will they appreciate the complexities behind the talking points.
The real opportunity in South Dakota is not to starve local governments of revenue but to rethink how government at all levels operates. Modernization, efficiency, and consolidation, not blunt tax cuts, hold the key to a stronger, leaner state. What South Dakota needs is not a DOGE project, but a serious conversation about how to align its government structure with the realities of the 21st century.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A special election to fill an Arkansas House seat left vacant by a lawmaker’s resignation will be held June 9, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared Friday.
Rep. Carlton Wing, a North Little Rock Republican, resigned on Sept. 30 to become CEO and executive director of Arkansas PBS, necessitating the special election.
Sanders previously set June 9 for a special election to fill the Senate vacancy created when Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, died Sept. 2.
At least two Democrats and one Republican have said they intend to run for Wing’s vacant seat. Four Republicans have said they’ll run for the Senate District 26 seat left by Stubblefield.
Sanders’ proclamation on Friday set the party primary elections for March 3, the same day as other state primaries.
State law requires the governor to call a special election to fill a legislative vacancy as soon as possible after the seat is vacated. The law also requires the special election to be held within 150 days unless it is impractical or “unduly burdensome” to do so, which Sanders said it would be.
Sanders made the same determination in setting the primary and general election dates to fill the Senate seat and drew criticism from some Republicans and the state Democratic party, who said the dates deprive District 26 residents of a voice in the legislature’s fiscal session in April.
A resident of the Franklin County portion of District 26 filed a lawsuit Monday, asking a Pulaski County judge to move up the special election to December so the district’s voters can be represented in the 2026 fiscal session. Lawmakers likely will consider funding for construction of a controversial state prison in Franklin County during the session.
The filing period for candidates in the House race will begin at noon on Nov. 3 and end at noon on Nov. 12, according to Sanders’ proclamation. The political parties must issue certificates of nomination by noon on April 10, and the candidates must file the certificates by 5 p.m. on April 13.
Any Independent candidates for the special election must submit their notices of candidacy, political practices pledges, affidavits of eligibility and petitions to the Secretary of State’s office by noon on April 13.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Senate President Nicholas Scutari became the latest state lawmaker to call for an independent monitor to oversee the work of a state anti-corruption unit that has routinely seen cases tossed because of alleged prosecutorial missteps.
Scutari’s call comes a week after a Superior Court judge dismissed charges against more than a dozen correctional officers accused of misconduct and other charges brought by the state Attorney General’s Office’s public integrity and accountability office, commonly called the OPIA, over inmate beatings at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility, New Jersey’s lone women’s prison.
“It is clear from the track record of the office that greater oversight and accountability are needed,” said Scutari (D-Union) in a statement. “The credibility of law enforcement is at stake. The public needs to have confidence in the ability of the office to carry out its responsibilities fairly, effectively and with adherence to the law. An independent monitor will help restore trust in the OPIA.”

Last week, Superior Court Judge Christopher J. Garrenger called the indictments against the correctional officers “unconstitutionally vague” because they did little to differentiate between the actions of each defendant, and cited a laggardly pace that ran afoul of New Jersey’s speedy trial rule.
Garrenger dismissed the charges with prejudice, meaning prosecutors cannot reraise them at a future date, though the Attorney General’s Office is appealing his decision.
The dismissal was only the latest black eye for the OPIA. In 2022, judges dismissed charges brought by the office against a Lakewood rabbi accused of misappropriating more than $200,000 in school funds and a separate indictment against Saddle Brook Police Chief Robert Kugler, who was accused of providing police escorts to his own funeral home. A Superior Court judge dismissed revived charges against Rabbi Osher Eisemann last year.
In both cases, judges said prosecutors had withheld exculpatory evidence. Charges against a Paterson officer accused of shooting an unarmed man were dismissed for a similar reason when, 18 months in, prosecutors revealed evidence showed the man had a gun the morning of or the night before the shooting.
Also in 2022, a judge dismissed charges against a separate correctional officer accused of having ties to organized crime after prosecutors said investigators had failed to record an interrogation, as state law and the Attorney General’s Office require.
Racketeering charges against South Jersey powerbroker George Norcross and a bevy of allies — perhaps the OPIA’s most public case — were dismissed in February after a state judge said prosecutors had failed to state the elements of a crime. The office has appealed the dismissal.
The Attorney General’s Office did not immediately return an email seeking comment.
Scutari’s call for independent oversight of the state’s anti-corruption unit is notable — he is the state’s highest-ranking legislator — but it wasn’t the first.
At least six state senators belonging to both parties have called for stricter oversight or investigations into the office, as have New Jersey NAACP President Richard Smith and New Jersey AFL-CIO President Charles Wowkanech.
Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union), a former Union County sheriff and a vocal critic of the OPIA, has called for an investigation into the office and introduced legislation that would require it to more quickly review misconduct cases.
Then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal created the public integrity and accountability office in 2018 as a response to court decisions that weakened federal bribery and corruption laws and to boost public confidence in police oversight amid rising scrutiny of fatal police shootings.
In addition to corruption cases, the office investigates allegations of civil rights violations by authorities, reviews internal affairs complaints, and evaluates wrongful conviction claims.

The Detroit-based nonprofit Mothering Justice — which centers its work on the needs and rights of mothers and families, from paid sick leave to affordable child care — hosted the grand opening of their new center in Detroit’s Eastern Market neighborhood on Thursday evening. Community members, friends and family members, and Mothering Justice staff gathered to share their hopes for the new, larger space. 
“We are welcoming you here. Please come back, please visit, bring your friends,” Danielle Atkinson, the executive director of Mothering Justice, said in an opening speech. “This space is living with all of the energy of all the movements and all of the causes that we are working for, for the liberation that we will see in our lifetime.”
While Mothering Justice is a national organization, their home has long been in Detroit — and that is intentional, Atkinson said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“When you talk about issues that are affecting moms, you can’t not think about economic and health issues and Detroit is ground zero for how moms have been mistreated, overlooked, underrepresented,” she said. “We have one of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the country, and also a lot of poverty. So when we’re talking about hitting those issues head on, we need to be in community, because we believe that the wisdom of the people who are affected by the issue is also what is going to change the world.”
“In 2025, we remain rooted in resistance. We will be ready for what’s to come,” said Liz Dupee, the team’s deputy director for strategic partnerships, as she welcomed guests into the space. “Our message is loud and clear: We won’t back down.”

Much of the work that Atkinson and her staff tackle involves the input of mothers in the community, especially mothers of color. Some of that involves qualitative research, led by Dr. Keiondra Grace, who noted how important it is to have a dedicated home for the work that she and her colleagues do. 
“I do a lot of interviews and focus groups and things like that. And so having this space is really helpful because then we can bring folks in,” she said, referencing an upcoming focus group on understanding how potential cuts to social programs like SNAP under the Trump administration are impacting mothers. 
It follows an October 2024 focus group, where mothers shared fears about those very cuts and how it could make things worse financially for them and their communities. 
“I’m really excited to talk at the end of the month to really understand, now that we are here in this space of, these things are likely going to happen, states don’t have money in the budget to really cover some of the things,” Grace added, “what they’re thinking and how they’re going to make ends meet, how they’re finding sources of resilience and joy, in spite of that.”

Other members similarly expressed excitement about having access to the space.
“We have access to what we need. We have full storage, and it just feels more comfortable,” said Toyja Bridges, an outreach coordinator who runs sessions known as Cocoa Conversations to connect with mothers in the community. “It’s just that one less thing that we don’t have to worry about, so it keeps you kind of focused on what’s important.”
“I’m excited to bring mamas here. I’m excited to have one-on-ones here,” said Christina Hayes, an organizer who manages work on ballot initiatives put forward by Mothering Justice. 
As she works towards a potential state-level ballot initiative on paid family leave, she noted the many considerations for that goal, from finances to ballot signatures. But the new home for Mothering Justice, she said, will be key to getting the community input that she needs to make it happen. 
But Atkinson also noted that the new office is not just helpful for research and advocacy — it’s also set up to be a place where mothers feel welcome. There is a kitchen, as well as a room specifically set up for kids to play, a very intentional setup. 
“This space means a lot for us,” Atkinson said. “It’s our first physical home since COVID. And having a place where moms can come, whether they work here or they’re just involved in the movement in some way, is really important because it just allows for collaboration, like a safe space and your babies can be loud here.”

In 2024, the Iowa Board of Pharmacy filed charges against the Food Land Pharmacy of Woodbine, alleging that on July 18, 2023, a Harrison County home-health worker noticed that the medication she was giving her patient did not match the description on the pill bottle.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In October 2023, the board alleged, the pharmacy failed to update its records by removing a “duplicative therapy” for a customer and as a result, the pharmacy dispensed the wrong strength of his medication for three months.
Around that time, another patient was allegedly given a lower-strength medication than was prescribed. The board also alleged that in July and August 2023, Food Land Pharmacy employed Sabine Guinn as a pharmacy technician despite Guinn’s lack of a registration as a pharmacy technician. The store failed to determine whether Guinn had the required registration before putting her to work in the store, the board alleges.
As part of a settlement agreement with the board, the store agreed to pay a $2,500 civil penalty and have all pharmacists and pharmacy technicians undergo additional training in patient safety and medication errors.
Also in 2024, the Board of Pharmacy alleged that pharmacist Christopher Steele of Underwood had incorrectly filled prescriptions for at least four patients in 2023. Steele told the Iowa Capital Dispatch the errors occurred at the Food Land Pharmacy where he worked.
Steele agreed to settle the disciplinary case by paying a $1,000 civil penalty and having his license placed on probation for one to two years.
Second set of charges filed in 2025
Earlier this year, the board charged Food Land Pharmacy with 10 additional regulatory violations — an exceptionally large number of violations for a pharmacy of that size.
The charges include failing to follow board rules related to recordkeeping, failing to follow board rules related to temporary pharmacy staff, failing to follow proper procedures related to controlled-substance registrations, failing to follow proper procedures for a change in the pharmacist in charge, failing to follow board rules related to accountability of controlled substances, failing to follow rules related to system security and safeguards, and failing to comply with the required drug utilization review process for a patient.
According to the board, those charges are tied to five separate complaints received by the board in the spring of 2024, and are tied to allegations of poor recordkeeping and lack of oversight concerning controlled substances.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, the pharmacy’s representatives recently agreed to surrender the business’ pharmacy license.
Food Land lawsuit led to major court decision
Court records show that Steele’s hiring at Food Land resulted in a significant court decision on the scope of a state law that legislators passed in 2022 in an effort to discourage price gouging by staffing agencies working for health care entities.
Shortly after the legislation was signed into law, a staffing agency called PharmServ Solutions sued the Food Land store, alleging the store had asked PharmServ to provide a pharmacist for six days in early 2022. PharmServ routed Steele to the job, after which Food Land allegedly hired Steele as a permanent employee of the store’s pharmacy. PharmServ then sued Food Land, alleging the store was refusing to pay an agreed-upon fee of up to $30,000 for Steele’s hiring.
Food Land argued the new price-gouging law prohibited employment agencies in the health care field from charging fees when temporary workers were hired by the agency’s clients on a permanent basis.
PharmServ argued the law didn’t apply since Food Land was not a “health care entity” as defined by the legislation. A Harrison County judge disagreed and dismissed the lawsuit while ruling that the new law applied to Iowa pharmacies and pharmacists.

Former Gillette librarian announced the settlement of her lawsuit against Campbell County and conservatives on the library board days before a key legislative meeting.
The post Fired Wyoming librarian hopes $700,000 settlement deters conservative lawmakers. They say it won’t. appeared first on WyoFile .","The Gillette librarian who this week settled a lawsuit against Campbell County over her July 2023 firing for a $700,000 payment says she hopes Wyoming lawmakers take note of the hefty sum.
Terri Lesley sued in April, alleging the Campbell County Public Library System Board of Trustees violated her First Amendment right to free speech and dismissed her in retaliation for her opposition to efforts by local conservatives to control where LGBTQ-centered books appeared in the library.
“My hope is that this will be a deterrent,” Lesley told WyoFile on Thursday, “that we can shut down all these censorship efforts in Wyoming and beyond.” 
But two Wyoming Freedom Caucus lawmakers who want the Legislature to weigh in on library materials statewide were quick to dismiss the idea that the hefty settlement should serve as a warning. The settlement does not include an admission of guilt by the county or trustees, they said, and is a separate matter from their legislative efforts.
The lawsuit Lesley settled this week was one of two she’s brought since her firing, with the second coming against members of a family, the Bennetts, who had prominently advocated for her removal as library director.
That lawsuit remains ongoing. Both suits were filed in federal court.
The Gillette News Record broke the story Wednesday and it quickly became a national news story. That news came just days ahead of a pivotal legislative committee hearing in Wyoming’s ongoing political debate over who should control access to library books. Lawmakers on the Joint Judiciary Committee will vote Monday on whether to bring a bill to the 2026 legislative session that would impose steep fines on public libraries and schools that leave books containing sexual material in places accessible to minors. 
Lesley, her lawyers, and a group of Wyoming advocacy organizations, librarians and other bill opponents see the court settlement as vindication of their stance against such laws.

“This case is about accountability and the rule of law,” Azra Taslimi, one of Lesley’s attorneys, told WyoFile. “It’s about what happens when government officials cross a constitutional line and try to prevent and punish a public servant for doing her job. Ms. Lesley was fired for standing up for the First Amendment, and the $700,000 settlement speaks volumes. It says the censorship has consequences that are legal as well as financial.”
Taslimi, who said her firm has worked on cases on behalf of librarians in other states, described efforts to regulate the material available in Wyoming  libraries as part of a nationwide push by conservative politicians to censure LGBTQ literature.
“These bills are not about protecting children,” Taslimi said. “They’re about controlling what people can read, think and talk about. What these bills are really trying to do is criminalize inclusion and erase stories that make some politicians uncomfortable.”
Lawmakers undeterred
In text messages to WyoFile, two House lawmakers from the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, who have been prominent advocates for regulating young people’s access to some books, indicate the lawsuit is unlikely to dissuade their efforts.
Rep. Anne Lucas, a Cheyenne Republican, Freedom Caucus-endorsed lawmaker and architect of the legislation now in front of the Judiciary Committee, told WyoFile the lawsuit settlement did not give her any pause in pushing forward. 
“The Library isn’t admitting any wrongdoing,” she wrote of the settlement agreement, and “by accepting it, Ms. Lesley agrees.” 
Lucas described the lawsuit as “an employment case, not a first amendment case and has nothing to do with legislative considerations.”
House Appropriations Committee Chairman John Bear, whose wife Sage Bear is a library trustee and was a defendant in the lawsuit, accused Lesley of being out for money, not standing on principle. 
“It is clear that the terminated librarian was more concerned about fleecing her prior employer than the supposed altruistic motive of standing up for LGBTQ rights,” Bear wrote. 
“I don’t believe the county’s insurance company or their attorneys should have settled this case, but I understand the business decision to attempt to keep costs of frivolous litigation minimized,” Bear wrote. Instead, he called for reform to Wyoming’s tort laws, which govern civil lawsuits and allow people like Lesley to sue for damages. 
Until lawmakers pass such reforms, “the left will always take advantage,” he wrote. 
The library book bill currently under consideration would likely open the door for more lawsuits against the government, but from people on the political right. The legislation creates a pathway for citizens to sue schools and libraries they believe are violating the rules. 
For her part, Lesley described standing up to political pressure for two years before her firing, including that brought by Sage Bear, as personally difficult but driven by obligations to her work and community. The same was true of her decision to sue, she said. 
“It has been very hard,” she told WyoFile. “But I felt like I had to do it, that I had to stand up for the First Amendment. It’s what libraries are about.” 
Lesley had worked in the Campbell County library system for nearly thirty years before she was fired.
Conservatives behind book regulating measures have pushed past legal warnings before. In Campbell County, the library trustees fired Lesley despite an explicit warning against doing so from a deputy county attorney in March 2022. In hindsight, the attorney nearly predicted this week’s settlement years before it became reality. 
“Litigation regarding censorship — which is waiting in the wings on all sides — would be cripplingly costly, time consuming, and very likely unsuccessful for the County,” the attorney wrote, according to a copy of her email included in Lesley’s lawsuit.
On Thursday, Rep. Bear continued to uphold the efforts of Campbell County conservatives, which resulted in the contested books ultimately being moved into the adult section of the library after Lesley’s firing. 
“Gillette public libraries are the first in the nation to stop the left’s onslaught on the innocence of children by moving books that sexualize children to the adult section of the library,” Bear wrote to WyoFile. “Is $700,000 too much to pay to save our children?”
But Lesley, who still lives in Gillette, said she does not believe the Freedom Caucus speaks for most Wyomingites on the issue. 
“I think they are representing a minority,” she said, describing herself as a fourth-generation resident of the state. “It’s a live-and-let live kind of state, and I just don’t see the people I know signing on to this.”

The librarian has received an outpouring of support from around Wyoming since taking her stand against the efforts to remove library books that began in Gillette in 2021, she said. At the special meeting where Lesley was fired, hundreds of people showed up to support her, while a few dozen residents attended to back the board, according to Gillette News Record reporting at the time. 
Legislative debate
Lawmakers have also seen mounting public opposition as Monday’s bill has moved through the interim period. In Casper in August, they faced a packed meeting room, the majority of whom were there in opposition to the bill, though it also drew supporters. Testimony at that meeting included a Methodist pastor who read lawmakers sexually explicit passages from the Bible — arguing their legislation would censure that religious text from children’s eyes as well.

In Cheyenne on Monday, the Judiciary Committee will not take further public testimony, having sat through hours of it in Casper. The Legislative Service Office’s website already lists four proposed amendments, and lawmakers are likely to bring more on the spot. Ahead of the meeting, advocacy groups have continued to call on their members to write lawmakers in opposition to the measure.
“Terri Lesley stood up for freedom, families, and the First Amendment, and she was proven right,” Nate Martin, a Laramie school board member and director of one such group, Better Wyoming, told WyoFile. “Now, as lawmakers consider a statewide ban along the lines of Campbell County’s, and they’re getting a thousand individuals contacting them in opposition to the bill, they’re finding out that the people of Wyoming don’t like book bans any more than the courts do.”
Local political activists, namely the Bennett family, did not just push for Lesley’s firing, they also sought to have her prosecuted. The Bennetts in 2021 pressed the Campbell County District Attorney’s Office to prosecute Lesley for providing obscene material to minors.
Prosecutors declined to bring charges after conducting what they described as an extensive review of state statutes, according to that still-active lawsuit, which Lesley filed in September 2023. The county attorney found that the books in question did not meet state statute’s definition of obscene materials, which requires sexual content to also lack “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”
The bill in front of the Joint Judiciary Committee would circumvent that language, which is derived from the legal test established by a pivotal 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case. In that case, Miller v. California, the justices found that literature or other content that carried those broader values could not be regulated as obscene without violating the First Amendment. 
Monday’s draft bill instead would insert into Wyoming law a list of definitions of sexual acts that cannot be depicted in literature available to a minor. 
The definitions include graphic descriptions like “ejaculation onto the person of another” or “contact between the mouth and genitalia or mouth and anus.” But critics say it does not take in the value or purpose of the work as a whole — like the more graphic passages of the Bible, which play into larger themes of the religious text. 
It would instead, Lesley said, allow conservative activists to go in and cherry pick sections of texts that offend them, without considering what value those books may bring young readers.
The current draft bill carries a suggestion from the Legislative Service Office — the state attorneys who draft bills and guide lawmakers on how to avoid conflicts with existing or constitutional law. 
“The Committee may wish to consider the use of the existing definition for ‘obscene’ as the designation of sexually explicit material,” LSO staff attorneys wrote in the bill draft. They are referring to the language derived by the Miller case, and cited by the county prosecutors who declined to criminally charge Lesley.

Administrators and teachers at the Danville School say closure could harm students with learning disabilities, who they say are underserved by nearby private high schools and would face long travel times to other public schools.

Danville residents are poised to vote in December on whether to shutter its high school grades at the Danville School and instead pay tuition for students to attend other schools, following a petition submitted to the school board Tuesday.
The petition has set the district on a collision course with a potential outcome public school faculty say would be devastating for the region’s most vulnerable students. The school board proposed a Dec. 6 special meeting for the vote, though the meeting won’t be officially set until next month. If the vote is successful, Danville School’s grades 9 through 12 would close by June 30.
The district would then pay tuition for those high school students to attend public or private schools, according to the language of the petition.
The potential closure of Danville’s high school presents troubling implications for public school students in the area, and has underscored long-held contentions around whether the region’s public and private schools share the same responsibility to serve students with disabilities or with other academic achievement barriers — a population on the rise in Vermont.
“They don’t have to take your kids,” David Warren, a Danville School social studies teacher, said Tuesday about two larger neighboring private schools. “And how do I know? Because we’ve been giving kids from those schools here in Danville a second chance.”
Danville School Principal Natalie Conway wrote to the school board in advance of its Oct. 7 meeting that the high school closure would leave “our area of the (Northeast Kingdom) a public high school desert.”
The closest high school would be St. Johnsbury Academy, followed by Lyndon Institute, both private institutions and designated by Vermont law as “independent schools” that are eligible to receive public dollars as tuition from school districts lacking public schools serving those grades. 
Since 2022, Vermont State Board of Education rules have required schools that accept public dollars to educate students eligible for special education services. However, Danville public school leaders and faculty have said they believe students with disabilities would go underserved by the closure — a claim that their counterparts at St. Johnsbury Academy refute.
“Students from all walks of life and all abilities who need a second chance, a smaller school, or more individual attention and support find a home in Danville School,” Conway said in her letter. “Students with disabilities find a home at Danville School.”
‘Imagine the costs’
The Danville school district, like many in the state, finds itself on shaky ground as Vermont works toward a major overhaul of its public education system.
Act 73, the sweeping education reform bill signed into law in July, calls for a vast consolidation of the state’s 119 school districts and a reorganization of how the state funds education.
A redistricting task force, made up of legislators, former superintendents and other experts, is tasked with crafting new school district boundaries for Vermont’s public education system in time for next year’s legislative session, which begins in early January.
But many fear the law’s implementation could mean the closure of small schools, pointing to required minimum average class sizes of at least 18 students for grades 9 through 12.
The petition, Danville board members wrote in a letter to the state’s redistricting task force after the Tuesday meeting, “is a direct result of great uncertainty due to Act 73 and your task force’s mission.”
Danville School hosts about 344 students from kindergarten through high school from Danville and surrounding towns, with roughly 70 students in the high school grades, according to district board Chair Clayton Cargill.
For the past month, the school board members have weighed whether to get ahead of changes envisioned by the new education law.

Their district is a member of the Caledonia Central Supervisory Union, which includes the Cabot and Twinfield school districts. Both of those districts also operate a K-12 school, with high school grades even smaller in size than Danville’s.
The uncertainty around Danville School’s future spurred a financial analysis, presented by board member Eric Hewitt during a September school board meeting. The analysis suggested that tuitioning out Danville’s high school students may produce a lower tax rate than if it were to continue operating its high school grades.
But that analysis has since been questioned by other board members and community members.
Cargill said in an interview Wednesday that the analysis did not take into account high school-aged students in Danville whose families currently pay for private school and would take advantage of a tuition system.
There is also the expense of ensuring that the district’s obligations to students with disabilities are being met, Danville high school’s principal noted in her letter. 
The next closest public high schools, Hazen Union and Lake Region Union, are each at least a 30-minute drive away from Danville School, Conway wrote.
“Imagine the costs associated with this transportation for general and special education students,” she wrote. “Imagine the costs for us as a (Northeast Kingdom) community associated with students who struggle to attend school dropping out at higher rates than we already experience.”
A state senator’s opinion
Nearby school boards have had similar discussions about potentially closing their high school grades. For Danville and Cabot, those discussions were prompted by a warning from Vermont Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, the chamber’s minority leader, according to their school board chairs. Those warnings were first reported last week by Seven Days.
Beck, a faculty member at St. Johnsbury Academy, warned school district and community leaders that lawmakers would likely seek to limit a district’s ability to offer its students the choice of attending a private school after a school closure in the next phase of educational reform.
Beck pointed to specific language that had been in an earlier version of the legislation requiring school districts that close a school to designate just three public schools to receive their students.
The Cabot School District had previously considered circulating a survey to residents about closing their schools and opting for school choice. But Cabot school board Chair Chris Tormey, said in an email this week that the board has decided to hold off on the survey “until we find out next year how Cabot School will be placed within the new statewide map.”
Audience members at the Danville board meeting were split on the urgency of making a decision about the high school. But several attendees zeroed in on accusations that Beck had unduly influenced the petitioners by spreading false information.

Warren, the high school social studies teacher, said the motivation behind the petition was “flat out wrong,” that the Act 73 process would not necessarily lead to the high school’s closure.
“Despite what you hear about small schools, we do offer a quality education. And about this decision, the politician that is behind it, in my opinion, is a coward, and worse, a bully,” Warren said.
Cargill said at the meeting that he felt he had been misled by Beck. 
“I paraded this information around town, and told people this information, and I feel lied to in the situation,” he said. “I feel like I’m part of a problem here.”
Beck refuted claims that he had a conflict of interest, and said in an interview Wednesday that he was merely offering his opinion to his constituents.
“People can certainly disagree with me, that’s fine, but I was straightforward,” he said. What he has been telling school district leaders like Cargill “is that I don’t think that you have forever to have this conversation.”
“I don’t think I misled or lied to anybody,” Beck continued. “It’s the opinion I conveyed last summer and it’s the opinion I still have today.”
‘We don’t do that’
Danville School faculty argue their school plays an outsized role in serving students with intellectual disabilities and from poorer backgrounds.
And without Danville’s high school grades, “there are going to be a fair number of students who will not be provided the opportunity for the free and appropriate education that they also deserve,” Beth Nishball-Williams, a special educator at the Danville School, wrote in a letter to the school board.
“Where do our autistic, intellectually disabled, multiple handicapped students go?” Nishball-Williams wrote. “Where do our students with social anxiety, speech and concerns, depression, or trauma go?”
That claim is partly borne out in public data, released last month by the Agency of Education in response to requests from the redistricting task force about the concentration of students with individual education plans, or IEPs, in different schools and school districts.

Twenty-two percent of Danville School students are on IEPs, while 49% are eligible for the federal free or reduced lunch program, indicating they live in households earning less than 185% the federal poverty level, according to data from the Agency of Education for the 2023-24 school year. 
Twenty-five percent of students from other school districts who attend Danville School are on IEPs, while 62% are on a free or reduced lunch program, according to that data. Data from previous years was not available.
Meanwhile, only 8.7% of St. Johnsbury Academy’s student body are on IEPs, according to that data, while just over 14% are on a free or reduced lunch program.
Lyndon Institute has higher percentages — 19.52% of the school’s student body are on IEPs, while just under 22% are on a free or reduced lunch program.
The data suggests that the academy is not enrolling students with disabilities. St. Johnsbury Academy officials contend that the opposite is true — that their low percentage of students with IEPs shows that they’re making progress toward the mandates in Act 173, Vermont’s 2022 special education law that sought to increase effectiveness of support services.
Academy Headmaster Sharon Howell said it was “patently false” that they are not serving students with IEPs, and said “the fact that we have fewer students on IEPs is not an indicator of failure. It’s actually a success story.”
Mathew Foster, the director of student services at St. Johnsbury Academy, said the data discrepancy is due the fact that some students are designated as being on 504 plans versus IEPs. The 504 plan categorization is another federal designation for students who need special support for learning, and does not follow the same procedures and requirements that an IEP would.
Howell said the academy’s philosophy is to shift their enrolled students with IEPs toward 504 plans or other in-house support services.
“Our philosophy is we want students to be able to do as well as they can, to be able to move into general education classes when that’s appropriate, so not just be stuck in individualized services classes in content areas, but to actually join some of the some of the gen-ed classes, if that’s appropriate,” she said.
Data provided by the academy for the 2023-24 school year shows a number of publicly funded students — about 24% — enrolled at the school are on IEPs, 504 plans, or “other support plans.”
Lyndon Institute officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Administrators and teachers at the Danville School nonetheless say their school is the fallback serving those students in the region.
In her letter, Danville School special educator Nishball-Williams wrote that “the truth is not everyone will be successful” at the two nearby private schools. She said she works with students from most of the surrounding towns that tuition out their students.
“I know this first hand because in the past five years I’ve had students on my caseload from Barnet, Peacham, Walden, Cabot, Lyndon, St. Johnsbury, Concord and Sheffield, as well as Danville,” Nishball-Williams wrote.
Caledonia Central Supervisory Union Superintendent Matt Foster said the nearby academies “don’t have to, nor (do) they, gear to try to meet the needs” of all students.
“There is flexibility at the academies where they are able to basically say, ‘We don’t do that’ with certain populations,” Foster said.
“Those aren’t my schools, so I can’t say what exactly they’re doing or not doing at this point in time,” he added, “but they definitely have a history of saying there are certain students that they don’t feel equipped to be able to take.”
‘An existential crisis’
The petition delivered at Tuesday’s meeting was organized by Peter Mantius, a faculty member at St. Johnsbury Academy.
“It’s my hope that every voting resident shows up at our special meeting fully informed and capable of voting on maybe the most important decision this town is going to make in a generation,” Mantius said during the meeting.
Mantius did not respond to a request for comment, but said during the September board meeting and in an op-ed published in the Caledonia Record that he and others had concerns similar to Beck’s — that the Legislature may soon block the district’s ability to adopt school choice.

Hewitt, the Danville School board member, was asked during Tuesday’s meeting for his position on potentially closing the school. He said he wanted more clarity on what comes of the redistricting task force.
“The question is, how is the redistricting community committee viewing us, Danville, in our current situation,” Hewitt said.
The school board, in its letter to the task force, asked members for clarity.
“We are at risk of making a very reactionary decision that will change this town considerably in
unforeseen ways,” the board’s letter reads. “With the lack of certainty or clarity around what will happen to a school like ours, which is in a remarkably unique situation in the state, we are forced to assume and plan for the worst case scenario, and do everything in our power to prevent it.”
Cargill expressed similar concerns before the meeting.
“We’ve been operating a pretty successful high school that we’re proud of throughout all these years,” Cargill said in an interview last week. “I think that’s the truth, but with what the state is forcing now, we’re sort of sitting in an existential crisis.”

,DC,2025-10-10 17:17:10+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,‘Substantial’ layoffs of federal workers launched by Trump administration amid shutdown,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/substantial-layoffs-federal-workers-launched-trump-administration-amid-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced Friday it had begun mass layoffs of federal employees, a step not taken during previous government shutdowns and one that could significantly reshape the size and scope of the government. White House budget director Russ Vought posted on social media mid-day that Reductions in Force, the technical name for layoffs, had started.“The RIFs have begun,” Vought wrote.  Vought didn’t share any other details on social media and a budget office spokesperson only said that the layoffs would be ""substantial"" after States Newsroom asked for information about how many federal workers and which departments would be impacted. The government shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Congress failed to pass a short-term spending bill.President Donald Trump has signaled for the last couple weeks that if Democrats didn’t help Republicans advance the stopgap funding bill in the Senate, he would take action. “I’ll be able to tell you that in four or five days if this keeps going on,” Trump said Tuesday. “If this keeps going on it’ll be substantial and a lot of those jobs will never come back.”Trump said Thursday that he would cut funding approved by Congress for programs he believes are supported by or generally benefit Democrats, but he didn’t provide any more details during a Cabinet meeting. Trump has also floated the idea of not providing back pay for furloughed federal employees, though he hasn’t made any firm determinations about whether he may try to reinterpret a 2019 law that guarantees back pay for all federal workers after a shutdown ends. The Congressional Budget Office estimated before the shutdown began that some 750,000 federal employees would be furloughed. Others have continued working but without pay.Thune blames ‘far-left activist base’ for shutdownVought’s announcement came just as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., wrapped up a joint press conference on Capitol Hill, where they called on Democrats to vote to reopen the government. “We have a majority of United States senators — 55 out of 100 senators are voting to open up the government,” Thune said. “We need five bold, courageous Democrats with a backbone who are willing to take on their far-left activist base and join us in passing this.”Thune largely rejected the idea floated by some Republican lawmakers that the chamber should get rid of the 60-vote threshold for advancing major legislation, which has so far blocked the House-passed stopgap spending bill from moving toward final passage. “There are folks out there that think that is the way we ought to do things around here, simple majority,” Thune said. “But I can tell you that the filibuster through the years has been something that has been a bulwark against a lot of bad things happening to the country.”Thune added the legislative filibuster, which is different from the talking filibuster that most people are familiar with, is necessary to protect the rights of the minority political party and give it a voice in running the government. Johnson nixes vote again on military payJohnson, R-La., remained consistent during an earlier press conference that he will not bring the House back into session to vote on a bill to ensure on-time pay for military members during the shutdown. He’s repeatedly said the best way to avoid delayed paychecks for federal workers is for Democrats to advance the House-passed stopgap spending bill. The stalemate over government funding largely revolves around whether congressional leaders will be able to find bipartisan compromise and enact legislation to extend enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, which are set to expire at the end of the year.Democrats argue lawmakers need to broker an agreement now, before open enrollment begins on Nov. 1. Republican leaders contend they’re willing to talk after the government reopens, but they haven’t provided any commitments and have been tight-lipped about what they’d be willing to consider. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said during a morning press conference before the layoff announcement that Republicans must compromise on health care. “What we’ve said to our Republican colleagues is we have to address the health care crisis that they’ve created decisively — that means legislatively and that means right now,” Jeffries said.",,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)This weekend, festivals celebrating Acadian and Creole culture will take over the Lafayette area, but some Canadians won’t be coming. Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican, says their absence is because of rhetoric from the White House, and he’s asking President Donald Trump for an apology.
Since taking office in January for his second term, Trump has made several comments about Canada becoming the 51st state and has chastised the country in his ongoing international trade war. Just this week, in a meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cracked a joke about a “merger” of the two countries. 
During a recent trip to the country to promote Louisiana tourism, Nungesser said many Canadians upset by Trump’s remarks told him they’re staying away from the U.S. — and Louisiana. Nungesser is now asking the president to apologize to Canadians in hopes of stopping the loss of tourism and diplomatic relations.
“They just pretty much said that they’re not coming back until he’s either out of office or he apologizes,” Nungesser said.
This weekend is the start of the Grand Reveil Acadien, or “Great Acadian Awakening,” near Lafayette, Louisiana. The nine-day festival happens every five years and celebrates the Acadians, descendants of early French settlers who came to Louisiana from Canada in the 1700s. It typically attracts many tourists from Canada, but some will not be making the trek this year because of Trump.
At least one tour company with plans of bringing four charter buses full of people canceled, according to Randal Menard, the president of the non-profit that puts on the festival.
“ After the tariffs and the president’s comments, he let us know that people were dropping like flies,” Menard said.
Trump’s trade war risks undoing Michigan’s hard-earned progress

Nungesser hasn’t heard back from the president and admits that an apology might not fully fix the issue. But he doesn’t know what else to do.
Tourism from Canada is down 20% to 30%, he said, and data from Canada shows a 25% drop in U.S. visits in July compared to last year.
He said the U.S. has become an unpopular destination for Canadians.
“Airlines still have the flights, but they’re not advertising travel to America,” Nungesser said.
As for this weekend, Grand Reveil Acadien will go on and will be flooded with Louisiana French music and the smells of good ol’ Louisiana cooking. But locals will celebrate without many of their Canadian cousins, said Menard.
“I mean, we’re gonna miss their presence. The program will go on, but it’s not gonna be the same without their participation,” Menard said.
He hopes their absence will only be temporary.

Free.,Trump undertakes a MAGA-centric makeover of US civics education,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-undertakes-maga-centric-makeover-us-civics-education,,"WASHINGTON — A slew of conservative groups will lead a new coalition to spur civics education and push the subject in a more patriotic direction, the U.S. Education Department announced last month, raising alarms for some traditional civics and education groups that were not included in the initiative.The America First Policy Institute, a think tank with close ties to the president, is organizing and coordinating the America 250 Civics Education Coalition made up of more than 40 national and state-based groups, including prominent conservative advocacy organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and Turning Point USA.The vast majority of the groups in the coalition promote a vision of U.S. identity that downplays historical wrongs associated with race and gender and projects the country as an exceptional force for good. Many are well-known conservative groups that have promoted President Donald Trump’s political agenda.The coalition lacks many of the more traditional civics education groups who say their nonpartisanship is a fundamental element of civics education, leading to concerns from those groups that civics education is really the initiative’s goal. “Our organization serves students in every state and over 80% of counties,” said Shawn Healy, the chief policy and advocacy officer at iCivics, a group that promotes public support for civics education. “You can’t do that if your curriculum is shaded red or blue — it has to be fiercely nonpartisan.”The coalition will have nothing to do with school curricula, a department official said last month, acknowledging that the agency legally cannot dictate what schools teach. And it will not receive any federal funding from the department, the official added.But the agency has taken other steps that appear designed to steer curricula in a more partisan direction.The same day the coalition launched, the department announced it would be prioritizing “patriotic education” when it comes to discretionary grants. The agency said patriotic education “presents American history in a way that is accurate, honest, and inspiring.”Earlier in September, the department said it would invest more than $160 million in American history and civics grants — a $137 million increase in the funds Congress previously approved.Civics as cultural battlegroundCivics — a branch of social studies that focuses on rights and obligations of citizenship and the basic mechanics of government — has been a bipartisan priority, though it’s become a hot-button issue within education culture wars regarding how and what is taught as America grapples with its complicated history. Many on the political right, including Trump, have long bristled at how that history is taught. Going back to his first presidency, Trump has sought to exert control over the subject.After retaking office in January, he reestablished the 1776 Commission — an advisory committee meant “to promote patriotic education.”“Despite the virtues and accomplishments of this Nation, many students are now taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but rather villains,” notes the executive order first establishing the commission during his first term. The commission released a 41-page report in January 2021 that drew criticism from historians and educators, including the American Historical Association.In a statement signed by 47 other organizations, the association wrote that the report makes “an apparent attempt to reject recent efforts to understand the multiple ways the institution of slavery shaped our nation’s history.” Trump formed the commission after The New York Times published the 1619 Project, which aimed to “reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.” Heritage Foundation, Turning Point USA sign up In its September announcement, the department said the coalition “is dedicated to renewing patriotism, strengthening civic knowledge, and advancing a shared understanding of America’s founding principles in schools across the nation.” The coalition will include more than 100 events and programs across the country over the next year as part of the administration’s celebration of the country’s 250th anniversary. The coalition is set to feature a 50-state “Trail to Independence Tour,” a “Fundamental Liberties College Speaker Series” as well as “Patriotic K-12 Teacher Summits and Toolboxes” aimed at supporting “patriotic teaching nationwide.” The America 250 Civics Education Coalition includes right-wing organizations like the Heritage Foundation — the architect of the sweeping conservative policy agenda known as Project 2025 — as is America First Legal, a conservative advocacy group founded by Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. Turning Point USA, co-founded by conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in September, is also part of the initiative. PragerU, a conservative nonprofit that has drawn questions among researchers and scholars regarding the accuracy of its content, was also listed as a member of the coalition.Education Secretary Linda McMahon was the chair of the board of the America First Policy Institute between her roles in the first and second Trump administrations. She had to sign an ethics waiver to participate in the coalition, according to the department official, who did not provide further details on what exactly this entailed. ‘News to us’While conservative political organizations were made part of the coalition, leading civics education groups were not even aware of it before its public launch.“Certainly, it was news to us about this coalition being formed,” Healy, of iCivics, said.Healy added that his group encourages the America 250 Civics Education Coalition “to be more pluralistic in orientation” and that the organization is “eager” to have a conversation with the coalition about what they’re doing.iCivics, a nonpartisan organization founded in 2009 by the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, launched CivxNow. The latter group describes itself as the country’s “largest cross-partisan coalition working to prioritize civic education in the United States.”CivxNow’s nearly 400 members comprise a broad swath of mainstream civics education groups. “It’s our fundamental belief, both as an organization and as a coalition, that civic education has to be fiercely nonpartisan and nonideological,” Healy said. But only one group — Constituting America — is a member of both CivxNow and the America 250 Civics Education Coalition. Momentum for civicsOthers in the civics education field said the added attention the initiative brings to the subject will be positive.The coalition “provides an opportunity for everyone interested in civic education and patriotic education to do something right now,” said Donna Phillips, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan Center for Civic Education, pointing to “decades where there hasn’t been enough, or any, attention to civic education.” Phillips, whose organization is a member of CivxNow, said she hopes “the civic education field more widely can benefit from the momentum behind the need for this and that we can all find a place within this momentum and this moment.” Hans Zeiger, president of the nonpartisan Jack Miller Center, described the administration’s initiative as the “latest development in what we take to be a growing movement for civics in the country.” Zeiger, whose organization aims to empower college professors to work on civics education and is a member of CivxNow, said his group is “very interested in growing the national civics movement, and glad that there are people all across the political spectrum getting involved in the push for civic education.”“It is always a good thing to have national dialogue on civics education,” the National Council for the Social Studies said in a statement. The council, part of CivxNow, added that they “strive for balanced conversations that will continue to elevate high quality social studies standards.” Teachers unions criticize coalition  The two major teachers unions, which are politically aligned with Democrats, blasted the coalition as unserious, and noted the lack of traditional civics groups.“We have decades of research on what works in civic education,” Mary Kusler, senior director at the National Education Association’s Center for Advocacy, said in a statement to States Newsroom. “The proposal they are peddling lacks the rigor and respect our students deserve — which is evident by the lack of any respected civics or civil rights organizations as signers.”Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement the 250th anniversary of the nation should have been “an opportunity for parents, teachers, historians and students to learn, celebrate, critique and think critically about our democracy.”“Instead, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and the America 250 Civics Education Coalition rushed to create programming based on a single Trump-approved, ideological narrative, excluding the very people who know our history best: civics teachers and historians,” she said.",,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678

Newsom introduced CARE Court to bring more people experiencing severe mental illness into treatment. It has helped fewer people than he projected, but a new law will make more people eligible for it.","In summary
Gov. Newsom introduced CARE Court to bring more people experiencing severe mental illness into treatment. It has helped fewer people than he projected, but a new law will make more people eligible for it.


One of Gov. Gavin Newsom‘s marquee mental health programs may broaden its reach despite persistent questions about the number of people it’s helping and whether it’s achieving the goals he set out for it when it launched.
Newsom today signed a law that expands eligibility for CARE Court to include people who experience psychotic symptoms as a result of bipolar disorder. Under the law’s previous constraints, only people with schizophrenia and other limited psychotic disorders were eligible.
Newsom in a written statement called the law and its expansion an important part of his administration’s efforts to bring people with serious mental illness into treatment. 
“California doesn’t sit on the sidelines while people fall through the cracks,” he said. “We don’t stand by while people spiral on our sidewalks or cycle through emergency rooms and jail cells — we step up. We built CARE Court to connect people to treatment, dignity, and accountability — because care and accountability belong at the center of how we serve our communities.”
Newsom introduced CARE Court in 2022, creating a program that allows family members, first responders, doctors and others to petition the courts on behalf of people with severe psychosis who couldn’t care for themselves. 
Once a petition is accepted, individuals are presented with a voluntary treatment plan, which can include counseling, medication and housing. If they refuse, a judge can, in theory, order them to participate in a treatment plan.
Almost two years in, CARE Court has struggled to fulfill Newsom’s initial promises. A recent CalMatters investigation found that the program has so far reached a few hundred people, far short of the thousands originally projected. 
The new law, by Sen. Tom Umberg, a Santa Ana Democrat, sailed through the Legislature with nearly unanimous bipartisan support, no votes against and just a handful of abstentions. 
“The beauty of CARE Court is that it holds both institutions and individuals accountable, ensures individuals get the care they need and gives judges a clear role in overseeing and guiding the process,” Umberg said in a written statement today. “This bill focuses on implementation by listening to and learning from counties about what’s working and what’s not, in order to meet the goals of the original CARE Court legislation.”
But the bill faced plenty of criticism in the community, with counties questioning how they will implement an expanded program on a tight timeline and disability rights advocates raising concerns about the effectiveness of a program they consider “unimplementable.”
“We have to tell the truth,” said Lex Steppling, a founding member of All People’s Health Collective. “This is not workable. It’s not going to be workable. And I personally believe the cracks in the foundation are getting bigger and bigger and it’s going to collapse.”  
Steppling saved his harshest criticism for “the state’s self-described ‘liberal and progressive’ politicians,” who he said were too afraid of the Newsom administration to oppose the bill.
Wide estimates on CARE Court expansion
Umberg’s legislation could expand CARE Court enrollment, though it’s unclear by how much. Umberg’s office doesn’t have an estimate of how many more people will be eligible for the program under the new parameters. San Diego County said the new rules could increase its numbers by anywhere from 3.5% to 48.1%.
“We’re trying to focus on the right populations,” Umberg said. “I do think it will expand it, but not dramatically.”
Monica Porter Gilbert, a mental health policy advocate with Disability Rights California, said the lack of clear information from the state about how the program has been implemented thus far is a big part of the problem. 
“It feels concerning to massively open the gates to expand eligibility for the program when we really have no evidence that the program is having a positive impact,” she said.
Umberg initially wanted to expand CARE Court in a way that would have made even more people eligible for it. An earlier draft of his legislation would have included all mood disorders with psychotic features. But critics, including the County Behavioral Health Directors Association, warned that “massive expansion” would lead to people flooding into CARE Court faster than counties could provide services. As a concession, Umberg eventually limited his bill to bipolar disorder. 
Newsom’s mental health overhaul
In addition to expanding eligibility, Umberg’s bill also eliminates what he said are some “inefficiencies” from the CARE Court process. That includes combining two early court hearings into one, he said, thereby reducing the amount of time participants have to spend in court and saving administrative resources. 
The legislation also allows the criminal justice system to refer someone directly into CARE Court if they are charged with a crime and are deemed incompetent to stand trial.
Michelle Doty Cabrera, executive director of the California Behavioral Health Directors Association, said her organization opposed the new law. She worries that counties won’t have the staffing or housing resources necessary to handle an influx of people. And they are still working out kinks in a system that is still relatively new, she said. 
At the same time, she said, county behavioral health departments are also pivoting to address dozens of other new initiatives, including Newsom’s 2024 mental health housing bond known as Proposition 1 as well as CalAIM, the governor’s overhaul of Medi-Cal for mental health services.
“We need to allow counties to implement the very many things that have been put on the table,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/032923-NEWSOM-MENTAL-HEALTH-OVERHAUL-AP-AH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678

Laura Kelly and Adam Proffitt, the state's budget director, gathered public ideas about shaping of the state government's next budget in 2026 during a town hall on Thursday evening at Salina South High School. The governor has scheduled seven more town halls through Nov. 12. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)SALINA — Anna Pauscher Morawitz devoted her opportunity to directly lobby Gov. Laura Kelly to request more be done to help Kansas rise above 47th in the nation in state appropriations for the arts.
During the first of Kelly’s eight town halls devoted to seeking public input on the next state budget, Morawitz said the arts in Kansas represented a $5.5 million industry and supported thousands of jobs despite the Kansas Legislature’s decision to cut funding and place new grant restrictions on the Kansas Arts Commission. In the 2025 session, the Kansas Senate went so far as to consider deleting the state’s $1 million annual investment in the commission hosted by the Kansas Department of Commerce.
“I’d like to know how you will encourage legislative and bipartisan support for funding and improving access for the arts commission and other creative commerce initiatives that build on our shared history, support educational and social benefits that make our state a place that people want to invest in and live?” Morawitz said.
Kelly, who was a member of the Senate in 2011 when Gov. Sam Brownback issued an executive order that temporarily defunded the commission, said she pledged during her 2018 campaign for governor to restore the important role of the arts commission. That was accomplished, she said, but arts funding remained a political target.
“I’m a true believer in the value of the arts,” Kelly said. “Now, what can we do about the Legislature? Well, unfortunately not all of them share my appreciation for the arts. I will propose in my next budget to restore the funding to the levels before the cuts.”
Exchanges like that between Morawitz and Kelly were repeated about a dozen times as Kelly and Adam Proffitt, the state’s budget director, met Thursday night with more than 100 people at Salina South High School.
Topics ranged from issues related to special education funding, the overall K-12 funding formula, college affordability, residential solar incentives, economic development, court-appointed public defenders, Medicaid expansion, funding of county treasurer offices, support for nonprofit organizations and the potential of National Guard troops being deployed in Kansas.

The first in line
The first person to address the governor was Justin Spiehs, who was irritated that he was arrested in June for criminal trespass at the Kansas Capitol during a political rally. He was repeatedly asked to move from a restricted space on the statehouse steps but declined. Speihs filed a lawsuit against members of the Kansas Highway Patrol and other officials, including Proffitt.
“I would say the worth of the state of Kansas depends on how much the government is willing to follow the Constitution,” Spiehs said.
“Sir, this is a forum on the budget,” the governor said. “Do you have a question related to the budget?”
“If you let me finish, governor, I’ll get to my question,” he said. “How much do you think that’s going to cost taxpayers to defend that lawsuit?”
“Sir, I’m going to cut you off,” Kelly replied. “If you want to go to the back of the line and formulate a question regarding the budget, we’ll be glad to respond.”
During a brief news conference after the town hall, Spiehs continued to toss questions at the governor about his lawsuit.
Jeff Hayes, executive director of the Central Kansas Cooperative in Education, which serves special education students in 12 central Kansas school districts, said it was important for the Legislature to comply with a state law to fully fund programs for disabled and gifted students in special education programs statewide. Currently, the Legislature doesn’t provide money to meet a mandate to cover 92% of excess special education costs otherwise borne by individual school districts.
“I know you’ve advanced in your budget a considerable amount of special education funding that has not been passed through the Legislature,” Hayes said. “Education isn’t fully funded until special education is fully funded.”
Kelly proposed a multiyear approach for Kansas to address its spending shortfall on special education. She said the federal government had also failed to deliver on an obligation to provide special education funding, which exacerbated the challenge for states.
“I bring this up regularly with our congressional delegation, hoping they will give it it’s due,” Kelly said. “I’m not optimistic given how things are right now at the federal level that we’re going to see that.”
Colin Burke, a student in Salina public schools, requested the governor work to concentrate her advocacy for continued funding of K-12 public schools and to make higher education affordable to residents of Kansans, which could include moderation of tuition rates and allocation of funding for scholarships.

Solar power, National Guard
Compensation that Kansans with residential solar panels receive for pushing power onto the electric grid should be improved, said Phil Black, a homeowner who said net metering policy in Kansas was tipped in favor of utility companies. Existing standards in Kansas provide homeowners a dollar-for-dollar credit for solar energy production up to the amount consumed by that homeowner, he said.
He said he received only 3.5 cents per kilowatt hour from Evergy. The Kansas Corporation Commission wasn’t interested in modifying compensation to small producers, he said.
“Is there anything budgetarily that could be done to help offset what we’re not getting?” Black said.
Kelly, who has supported development of wind and other forms of renewable energy, said she would refer his inquiry to others in her administration.
“This is not something we’ve thought about before, but it’s something we will take back and we will talk with folks who know more about this that we do,” she said.
Shelby Hermosillo, who was among a group of women arrested in September during a protest in Washington, D.C., sought assurances from Kelly that she wouldn’t allow National Guard troops to violate civil rights if deployed in Kansas. President Donald Trump has argued National Guard troops should be sent to cities or states led by Democrats to quell protests, safeguard ICE personnel or quell protests.
“As an activist in the community who cares about the community safety but also our financial security, particularly for impoverished, marginalized people, how would you balance the financial and community impact if the National Guard were deployed to Kansas?” Hermosillo said. “What safeguards would you put in place to make sure that their use aligns with both fiscal responsibility and protection of Kansas’ civil rights?”
Kelly, who is chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said no one needed to worry about her deploying the National Guard to advance Trump’s agenda.
“I have been adamantly vocal about how inappropriate it is to use our National Guard to do law enforcement,” Kelly said. “That is not what they signed up for. That is not what they’re trained to do. That’s not what they’re budgeted to do.”
Kelly has scheduled comparable town halls between Oct. 29 and Nov. 12 in Hays, Garden City, Leawood, Emporia, Pittsburg, Wichita and Kansas City, Kansas. The objective, she said, was to gather insights from the public as she prepares budget recommendations for the 2026 Legislature.
“We’re going to take what we’ve heard here tonight, and what we’ll hear in the next seven stops that we make, and we really, truly will put that together … to put the budget together,” Kelly said. “We will do what we can to reflect the kinds of things that we’ve heard here and that we expect to hear across the state.”
She urged participants at the town hall to share their budget priorities with legislators representing the Salina area.
“Go where they are and express your concerns about this and anything else that you’ve got,” Kelly said. “It really is the responsibility of elected officials to be transparent, to be receptive to their constituents’ input.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Proffitt-Kelly-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678

Robert Clark’s early advocacy,Derrion Arrington,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/10/historian-mississippi-medicaid-robert-clark-advocacy/,"Historian says that policies advocated more than 50 years ago by Robert Clark, the state's first Black legislator since Reconstruction, are still important today.","Editor’s note: Historian Derrion Arrington reflects on early positions taken by Robert Clark, who in 1967 became the first Black Mississippian elected to the state Legislature in the 20th century, and how those issues championed by Clark are being addressed today.

Mississippi’s struggles with Medicaid are deeply tied to the state’s broader history of social, racial and political tension.
When President Lyndon Johnson established Medicaid nationally in 1965, it marked a landmark federal expansion to provide health care for low-income Americans. The program coincided with sweeping civil rights reforms, placing the provision of basic health care at the center of debates about equality, federal authority and social justice.
In Mississippi, resistance to Medicaid reflected long-standing patterns of political conservatism, racial segregation and apprehension toward federal oversight. Many state leaders feared that expanding social programs would upset the established social hierarchy and erode local control. Southern governors repeatedly requested delays in implementation, citing concerns about raising funds and securing legislative approval, while conservative lawmakers warned against what they framed as a slippery slope toward socialism.
Amid this climate, state Rep. Robert Clark Jr., the first Black legislator in Mississippi in the 20th century, emerged as a rare voice insisting that moral imperatives should outweigh political caution. Clark called for a special session to prioritize Medicaid over other state programs, arguing that the needs of Mississippi’s most vulnerable citizens demanded immediate action.

“Before we place any new tax burdens on the backs of poor people, we must do something to help them survive,” Clark declared.
Clark’s proposals were ambitious. He sought to fund Medicaid by reallocating state resources, including defunding the state Sovereignty Commission – a segregationist spy agency that had long promoted racial hierarchies under the guise of preserving state autonomy. He also proposed expanding Medicaid to include welfare recipients who had previously been excluded.
Conservative factions, led by figures such as Sen. W. B. Alexander of Cleveland, opposed these measures vigorously, arguing that Medicaid expansion threatened to increase taxes and represented a form of “government overreach.”
Ultimately, in 1969 Gov. John Bell Williams did call a special session as Clark proposed. It was intense. Legislators debated heatedly, weighing fiscal concerns against human need. At one point, Rep. Sterling Seabrook collapsed on the House floor, a stark illustration of the session’s tension.
Despite the opposition, the Medicaid bill passed the House 79-34 and later secured Senate approval on Aug. 7, 1969. Mississippi, though late to the program, became the second-to-last state to implement Medicaid — a testament to the persistence of advocates like Clark, who fought to protect the state’s most marginalized residents.
This episode established a pattern that would endure for decades. Medicaid and other social programs in Mississippi were repeatedly subjected to political compromise, delay and retrenchment. Welfare reform in the 1990s introduced work requirements and time-limited benefits, disproportionately affecting Black and low-income communities.
Starting in 2010, Mississippi has repeatedly rejected Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, leaving hundreds of thousands without coverage and cementing structural gaps in health access.
The historical arc of Medicaid in Mississippi demonstrates a fundamental tension between the ethical imperative to protect vulnerable populations and the political pressures to restrict government programs. Each policy decision, delay or rollback reverberates through communities, shaping health outcomes, economic opportunity and intergenerational equity.
The battles of 1969 are not distant history. They are a lens for understanding contemporary struggles over access, equity and the moral responsibilities of government.
The 2025 policy context
More than five decades after Clark’s advocacy, Mississippi faces another high-stakes battle over public health coverage. In July 2025, the federal government enacted what supporters labeled the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping package that significantly reduces Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding.
While the bill – now law – was framed as a measure to promote fiscal efficiency and personal responsibility, public health experts warn its provisions could have profound consequences for the state’s most vulnerable populations. The law imposes work or community engagement requirements for Medicaid recipients aged 19 to 64, tightens SNAP eligibility and reduces overall Medicaid spending by 12%.
Proponents argue the reforms encourage self-sufficiency and reduce federal spending, yet in a state like Mississippi – where poverty is widespread, rural infrastructure is limited and access to health care is already precarious – the practical effects are stark. Analysts estimate tens of thousands could lose coverage and critical nutritional support, amplifying structural inequities that have persisted for generations.
The Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus convened a hearing in September to examine the fallout. Lawmakers, researchers and advocates warned that the federal law threatens health outcomes, workforce stability and community well-being. Nearly 1 in 5 Mississippians lives below the federal poverty line, and the state ranks among the worst nationwide for maternal mortality, chronic disease management and child nutrition. For these communities, Medicaid and SNAP are lifelines, not abstractions.
Dr. Laila Henderson of the University of Mississippi Medical Center testified: “Policy is never abstract. It determines who lives and who suffers. Cutting Medicaid coverage for working families destabilizes entire communities.”
The debate over the federal law also highlights the persistent tension between federal mandates and state autonomy – a tension that has shaped Mississippi’s social welfare history. Just as Southern governors in the 1960s delayed Medicaid citing funding and legislative concerns, modern leaders navigate the pressures of balancing political priorities, federal requirements and urgent public needs.
Looking forward: A moral imperative
The struggle over Medicaid in Mississippi is both a continuation of a decades-long battle and a reflection of enduring questions about the role of government in protecting its most vulnerable citizens.
From Robert Clark’s 1969 advocacy to the debates surrounding the “One Big Beautiful Bill” in 2025, the state has repeatedly confronted the tension between political priorities and moral responsibility. Clark framed Medicaid not as a political program but as a matter of survival and justice.
“There’s no need for babies to continue to suffer for lack of medical attention,” he said.
This ethos remains urgent. Today’s policymakers face the consequences of decades of delayed or restricted programs. The cuts  in the 2025  federal legislation threaten to widen health disparities, destabilize families and strain fragile rural and urban infrastructures.
The moral question is clear: Will Mississippi once again prioritize political expediency over human need, or will it act decisively to protect access to essential services?
The stakes are both ethical and practical. Reductions in coverage jeopardize public health, weaken the workforce and threaten economic stability. They exacerbate cycles of poverty and inequality that have long defined Mississippi’s social landscape.
Conversely,  expanding access to Medicaid and SNAP strengthens communities, stabilizes local economies and promotes intergenerational equity – the very goals Robert Clark championed more than 50 years ago.
Ultimately, the fight over Medicaid is a measure of Mississippi’s values. Clark died earlier this year. His legacy reminds contemporary leaders that social programs are not merely budgetary line items. They are lifelines that define the character and conscience of the state.
As Mississippi navigates the 2025 policy landscape, the state faces a choice: continue a legacy of resistance that leaves vulnerable populations at risk or embrace a vision of governance that prioritizes care, equity and moral responsibility.
The stakes are profound, the consequences tangible and the opportunity to act morally and decisively is as urgent as it was in 1969.

After weeks of waiting, California’s governor signed a bill that will allow mid-rise apartment buildings near major transit stops in California’s biggest metro areas.


Ever since the Legislature narrowly passed a bill last month that will pave the way for more apartment buildings around major public transit stops in the state’s biggest metro areas, the California political universe has been impatiently awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature or veto in a heated statewide game of “will he, won’t he.”
Today, he did. 
Newsom’s sign-off on Senate Bill 79 means that apartment developers will soon be able to pack more homes into neighborhoods within half a mile of major rail, subway, and bus rapid transit stops, overriding local zoning restrictions and any possible objections of surrounding neighbors. Buildings immediately surrounding these transit hubs will be entitled to max out as high as nine stories, with those farther out topping out at roughly four.
“The world looks to California for leadership — it’s time to build modern, connected communities that fulfill California’s promise, meeting the needs of today and the next generation,” the governor wrote in a signing statement.
The signature caps a legislative year full of housing policy overhauls that even just a few years ago would have seemed unthinkable. It also reaffirms the governor’s political alignment with the “Yes In My Backyard” movement, which has been championing the cause of building more housing in the face of a statewide housing shortage for nearly a decade. This summer Newsom signed YIMBY-backed legislation to exempt most urban apartment projects from review under one of the state’s signature environmental protection laws. “Go YIMBYs,” Newsom said when signing that bill into law. 
The new law is, indeed, a signature victory for the movement. The bill’s author, San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat, introduced an earlier version of the policy in 2018 with the support of the then still relatively new political organization California YIMBY. This year’s version, which narrowly passed both the Senate and Assembly last month with few votes to spare, marks Wiener’s fourth attempt.

“In California we talk a lot about where we don’t want to build homes, but rarely do we talk about where we do—until now,” said Wiener in a statement. “SB 79 unwinds decades of overly restrictive policies that have driven housing costs to astronomical levels, forcing millions of people away from jobs and transit and into long commutes from the suburbs or out of the state entirely. It has been a long road to tackling these decades-old problems, but today’s signing marks a new day for affordable housing in California.”
Newsom’s signature comes as a grave disappointment for many local governments and neighborhood groups, particularly in Southern California. Last month, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass urged Newsom to veto the bill, saying that it would “erode local control, diminish community input on planning and zoning, and disproportionately impact low-resource neighborhoods.” Irate homeowner groups and state legislators raised concerns that mandating higher levels of housing density would “fundamentally reshape” suburban-style neighborhoods.
The “upzoning” policy was meant to be a two-fer: Allow for much more housing construction as a way to alleviate the state’s housing shortage and its resulting affordability crisis, while also steering more residents towards cash-strapped public transportation systems. 
Despite the ferocity of the opposition, the bill that Newsom signed is considerably more modest than the version introduced at the beginning of the year. 
After 13 separate rounds of amendments, the law will be restricted to just eight highly urbanized counties — Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Santa Clara, Alameda, Sacramento, San Francisco and San Mateo — and apply only to select transportation stops (train, subway, light rail and high-frequency buses routes with designated lanes). The law will also give local governments alternative means to comply with their own local programs, require a certain share of units constructed under the bill to be set aside at below-market rents and go into effect on a delayed schedule in certain lower income neighborhoods.
Even in that more muted form, the law is one of most consequential changes to statewide zoning rules in modern California history. 
Over the last weeks, Newsom has come under sustained pressure from both supporters and opponents. Advocates for historic preservation, tenant rights, local control and affluent neighborhood groups, along with Republican gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton and former reality TV star Spencer Pratt, have rallied their respective audiences to inundate the governor’s office with calls and emails urging a veto. Supporters — among them national political commentators, billionaire megadonor Tom Steyer and every corner of the organized YIMBY online universe — have urged their supporters to do the opposite. 
Popular interest in the outcome of the bill seemed to escape the confines typical of California legislative debate. Earlier this week, an online betting pool popped up (the odds were always good for Newsom’s signature). The topic even came up during the governor’s guest appearance on the recent livestream of the popular online gamer known as “ConnorEatsPants.” 
Responding to a stream of public comments from his audience packed with incessant inquiries about the bill, the streamer prompted Newsom: “I don’t know what this is, but they’re saying you need to talk about SB 79.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/030925_BART_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 12:59:20.814066

Michael Padilla discusses appropriating capital outlay funds for New Mexico's 89 public schools security,"State Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) pushed to include funds for security technology and infrastructure at all 89 of New Mexico's public school districts. (File photo/Source NM)New Mexico public school districts have begun receiving portions of $35 million appropriated during the regular legislative session earlier this year for school security and safety improvements during the 2026 fiscal year.
The funds were appropriated through House Bill 450, which set aside funds for myriad capital outlay projects across the state. That includes include $50 for school security, continuing technical education equipment, school maintenance and repair, of which $35 million will benefit security upgrades. Majority Whip Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) advocated for including the security and safety fund appropriation in the bill.
“The objective here is to make sure that the school grounds are safe, warm, inviting. That they’re a place of learning, not a place that you need to be worried about going to,” Padilla told Source NM. 
He added that school districts have made large investments in recent years to improve security measures through various technologies. The $35 million is a way to supplement the previous investments and further improve districts’ security approach.
“We’ve seen the proliferation of cameras all around schools, all around our community,” he said. “This [money] actually really helps to tie all that together with an innovative approach to gun detection…you know, what’s coming into the school grounds and in bags and this and that.”
The funds will be distributed by the New Mexico Public Schools Facilities Authority among all 89 New Mexico public school districts, in proportion to the district’s proposed projects. Gallup and Gadsden schools districts will receive the largest amount of funds —approximately $5.9 and $4.1 million respectively. 
“Even if you’re a smaller district than, say, Las Cruces or Albuquerque or Santa Fe or whatever, you might have greater needs from a technology implementation standpoint than some of these larger districts, because they’ve had more money already on hand to implement this stuff,” Padilla said. “We want to make sure that every district is eligible, including the smallest schools in the state.”
Padilla added that this is a one-time appropriation, as lawmakers cannot guarantee that these funds will be included in the appropriation budget each year. He emphasized that New Mexico is undergoing changes due to federal funding cuts and the natural variability in the oil and gas industry.
However, he said the appropriation is one small way to help districts be proactive in improving school security and stop dangerous scenarios from playing out before they occur.
“This is one way for us to do that,” he said. “Our children deserve the absolute best, safest, warmest, inviting environment… Take that noise out of their way so that when they’re in the public school, all they’re worried about is learning rather than, ‘Am I safe here?’”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HK7A0398-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 12:59:20.814066

Gov. Joe Kelly during the first Trump administration.
The Republican-led U.S. Senate voted 51-47 Tuesday to approve a backlog of more than 100 nominees at once, which included the appointment of U.S. Attorney Lesley A. Woods for Nebraska. Senate Republicans changed internal rules last month to allow most executive branch nominees to be confirmed as a group, rather than individually.
Former President Joe Biden did not nominate a permanent U.S. attorney after taking office in 2021. Kelly served between 2018 and 2021 after being confirmed by voice vote.

President Donald Trump nominated Woods on May 6, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed her as interim attorney a few days later. Woods previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney for Nebraska between 2017 and 2023. She was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas between 2014 and 2017.
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, Nebraska’s senior senator and a Republican, recommended both Kelly and Woods for Senate confirmation, and Fischer offered her congratulations to Woods this week.
“I am confident that Lesley will excel in this role, which is why I strongly recommended that President Trump nominate her for this position,” Fischer said in a statement. “I look forward to seeing Lesley work efficiently and effectively — as she has done throughout her career — to keep our families and communities safe.”
A spokesperson for the Nebraska U.S. Attorney’s Office reached Thursday said the office could not comment on Woods’ confirmation due to the federal shutdown.
While an assistant U.S. attorney for Nebraska, Woods served as Nebraska’s violent crime coordinator, where she prosecuted gang cases, homicides, armed robberies and firearms conspiracies. She also served on the federal judicial district’s Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force and prosecuted human trafficking cases and other complex matters.
Between late 2023 and early this year, she was a trial attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Security Division, Counterterrorism Section. Woods was assigned to a Justice Department task force around the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack against Israel. She also served as a national security and cybercrimes prosecutor in Maryland between January and May of this year.

Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers on Thursday posted on X that he is “proud to be her teammate in our efforts to keep Nebraska safe!”
“We are very lucky to have Lesley in this role — in her short time at the helm, she has proven to be a highly skilled, tough, energetic and principled leader,” Hilgers wrote.
Woods is a native of Colorado and a graduate of the state’s Metropolitan State College and the University of Colorado. She earned a law degree from the University of Iowa and enlisted in the U.S. Air Force after. Nebraska became home after Woods met her husband, who is from Grand Island.
Kelly, in a statement to the Nebraska Examiner, described Woods as “a highly skilled and experienced prosecutor.”
“She is uniformly respected by local, state and federal law enforcement partners,” Kelly said. “Lesley is a fantastic selection for this position, which will help keep Nebraskans safe.”

The federal government shutdown is stretching into a second week with no end in sight. As Democrats and Republicans in Congress face a politically charged funding impasse, nutrition experts warn that women and children reliant on federal food assistance funding are particularly vulnerable to imminently losing their grocery benefits.
In the midst of it all, America’s ability to track the real-world impacts of the shutdown on hunger is disappearing. Shortly before the shutdown, the Department of Agriculture moved to scrap the Household Food Security Report, the nation’s primary tool for tracking food insecurity, and in doing so, stripped away the very infrastructure needed to remedy rising hunger in America.
“If you want a functioning country where people are food-secure, this is the survey that gives you an indication of how food-secure people are. And that data shows us that food insecurity has gone up,” says Zia Mehrabi, a data scientist researching climate change and food insecurity at the University of Colorado Boulder. “So, actually, as a country, the government response to that should be, ‘How do we fix that?’ rather than say, ‘Oh … let’s cut the whole survey altogether.’”
If the shutdown continues into next week, the lapse in government funding could directly affect the nearly 7 million American pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children that rely on WIC, or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The National WIC Association has warned that the program is days away from running out of money. The USDA told state agencies last week that they will not receive their quarterly allocation of money for WIC because of the lapse in federal funding, CNN reported.
On Tuesday, the White House stated that it would use revenue from some of President Donald Trump’s tariffs to pay for the WIC budget shortfall. Just how much funding would be provided, and how that would work, however, went unspecified. “While Democrats continue to vote to prolong the government shutdown, blocking funding for mothers and babies who rely on Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), USDA will utilize tariff revenue to fund WIC for the foreseeable future,” a USDA spokesperson told Grist. The representative did not provide clarification on the impacts of the shutdown on nutrition funding, nor did they provide further details about Trump’s proposed tariff revenue strategy. The White House declined Grist’s request for comment.
According to Mitch Jones, managing director of policy and litigation at Food & Water Watch, the president’s tariff move is “likely impossible” without an act of Congress to appropriate the funds. The nonprofit mapped where the most young children at risk of losing benefits live, finding that the shutdown will affect the highest proportion of kids in Puerto Rico, California, and New York.
“It is poor women and children who will feel the impacts first and worst,” said Jones.
In the U.S., food insecurity is not a problem of production. (America grows and imports more than enough food to feed its population.) Food insecurity is an economic and social condition. When low-income households are forced to decide between rent, utilities, gas, or groceries, research shows that food is almost always one of the first costs that people cut.
The 2023 Household Food Security Report found that 13.5 percent of American households, or roughly 47.4 million people, were struggling to afford enough food to meet basic nutritional needs. Nearly 14 million of them were children. The survey gathers data about economic status, food accessibility, and participation in federal and other food assistance from a nationally representative sample of roughly 30,000 U.S. households. That report, which contains the most recent data available, also revealed that not only had food insecurity overall risen from the year before, but that the number of food-insecure children had leapt by 3.2 percent in that same time period.
The idea for the survey came to a head during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, when anti-hunger activists and policymakers ramped up discussions about tracking the economic levers that contribute to food insecurity on a large scale. It became evident that there was no relevant government data to enable their work, which sought to counter the Reagan administration’s move to shrink nutrition assistance funding based on a stagnating number of people using federal food benefits — a benchmark of national hunger. The government’s stance was in sharp contrast with soaring demand reported by food banks, and what activists and media coverage were capturing at the time.
In 1990, Congress passed legislation that mandated nutritional monitoring and research, which would serve as the formal basis for the creation of the annual food security survey carried out by the Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service, or ERS.
Officials, local leaders outline what shutdown means for Nevada

In the decades since, the data has been widely regarded as the federal government’s most accurate, reliable, and comprehensive way of measuring national food insecurity and Americans’ economic well-being. “I think that it is on the same level as the unemployment rate and the poverty rate. It’s one of those central measures,” said Colleen Heflin, a professor at Syracuse University who researches food insecurity, nutrition, and welfare policy.
When the USDA announced its termination of the survey on September 20, the agency called it “redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous,” and claimed that it does “nothing more than fear monger.” Shortly after, roughly a dozen ERS staffers were placed on administrative leave.
Other federal datasets do capture some of the indicators recorded by the food security survey. But those reports are scarce and limited in their scope, according to Heflin. The Household Trends and Outlook Pulse Survey is one example — collected every other month, it asks fewer and much less detailed questions about food insecurity. Heflin says it’s a poor substitute for the annual report. She also strongly objects to the USDA’s claim about the purpose of the survey. “Clearly the person that wrote that announcement has never read the food security report,” said Heflin. “It is a very, very dry and clearly written report that just describes the statistics. There’s nothing about fear-mongering. [That’s] so far from the truth.”
The USDA’s press release also noted that trends in the prevalence of food insecurity have remained “virtually unchanged” despite substantive increases in SNAP spending — and evidence of rising food insecurity captured by earlier surveys.
“For 30 years, this study — initially created by the Clinton administration as a means to support the increase of SNAP eligibility and benefit allotments — failed to present anything more than subjective, liberal fodder,” a USDA representative told Grist. When asked how USDA plans to track food insecurity in America moving forward, the spokesperson noted the agency “will continue to prioritize statutory requirements and where necessary, use the bevy of more timely and accurate data sets available to it.”
Heflin warns that the loss of the report will have wide-reaching consequences. “It really leaves a huge hole in our understanding of who is food insecure, where food insecurity is most prevalent, and how changing economic conditions and policy conditions are impacting the American population,” said Heflin.
“I think of it as driving without your speedometer,” she said. “We’re not going to have accurate information to guide our reactions, both from a federal policy level and community level … We really are driving blind.”
The timing could not be worse. Food prices are at the highest they’ve been in five years, up 29 percent since 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. America’s public safety net is shrinking, too: Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” cut an estimated $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and tightened work requirements that reduce eligibility of who can qualify for the benefits.
“People are struggling to put food on their tables, and farmers are losing support, and food banks are being pushed beyond capacity,” said Jenique Jones, the executive director of the nonprofit WhyHunger. “Removing this data specifically — it silences the reality of hunger in America.”
All the while, climate change is further inflating the cost of food. It’s another reality that University of Colorado Boulder’s Mehrabi sees worsening as Trump continues his misinformed climate denial campaign and regulatory rollbacks. The growing destabilization of food supply chains — wrought by the compounding impacts of extreme weather events, global warming, the spread of diseases and pests, and migration and conflict — makes climate change one of the biggest threats to global food security, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
Rising carbon levels also diminish the nutritional values of the food we eat, making it even harder for people to get the base nutrition they need.
“There’s really clear evidence that things like zinc, vitamin A, iron, these really important micronutrients that we are really dependent on, are going to go down with climate change,” said Mehrabi. “Climate change is putting up the price, and pushing down the nutritional content. So what do you think that’s going to do to low-income households that are trying to feed kids that need their micronutrients?”
All the while, the government shutdown has left thousands of workers across the nation bereft of income, in danger of falling behind on bills and over the “hunger cliff.” And without the national hunger dataset, Mehrabi warns that our ability to track the longer-term effects of government policy on food insecurity — or of the shutdown’s possible lapse in food assistance benefits — will be very difficult to do. As will efforts to combat what’s driving more and more Americans to struggle to afford food.
“The government wants to reduce accountability. This is the big picture of what’s happening right now. You’d be blind to think this is just the USDA, just one thing. This is a whole systematic attack,” he said. “There’s a story being told that this is going to make America great again. Actually, this is going to make America worse.”

As a result, the board alleges, the patient was in pain and eventually required treatment for an infection.

Without admitting any wrongdoing, Blount recently agreed to surrender her license with the understanding that she can seek reinstatement in one year, according to board records.
It’s not the first time Blount has been sanctioned by the board.
In 2007, the board charged Blount with employing or permitting an unregistered person to practice dental assisting, and with failing to maintain adequate infection control protocols. As a result, her license was placed on probation for two years.
In 2013, the board again charged Blount with employing or permitting an unregistered person to practice dental assisting. In that case, the board imposed a $500 civil penalty but took no action restricting her license or practice.

Democratic Gov. Janet Mills is supposed to announce a run for U.S. Senate next week, in an attempt to unseat Republican Susan Collins. 
On Friday, the online news publication Axios reported that Mills plans to announce her run Tuesday, based on an internal document it obtained. The Associated Press also reported that two people familiar with Mills’ plans confirmed that she is planning to announce her run.
The two-term governor has been the choice of national Democrats, who have been focused on unseating Collins. She gained national attention earlier this year after her tense exchange with President Donald Trump over Maine’s inclusive transgender student policies. 
The field to unseat Collins has already garnered national attention as oysterman Graham Platner has made waves as a newcomer, drawing a crowd in Collins’ hometown just last week. 
In a crowded Democratic primary, Mills would face not only Platner, but also Dan Kleban, co-founder of Maine Beer Company, David Costello, Jordan Wood, Daira Smith-Rodriguez, Andrea LaFlamme, Tucker Favreau and Natasha Alcala.
The announcement is expected to be a turnaround for Mills, who said in April that she had no plans of running for Senate. Last month, she said she was “seriously considering” a run and had planned to announce her decision in November.
Spokespeople from the governor’s office did not comment on Mills’ run.

Educator and mountaineer, he climbed the Grand Teton more than 400 times, including a one-day ascent at age 75.
The post Teton mountain guide and avalanche expert Rod Newcomb dies at 91 appeared first on WyoFile .","Teton mountain guide and avalanche expert Rod Newcomb, who climbed the Grand Teton more than 400 times in a 48-year career, died in Jackson on Thursday at the age of 91.
A family member said Newcomb, former co-owner of Exum Mountain Guides, died of natural causes surrounded by family.
Newcomb first came to Jackson Hole as a teenager in 1953, leaving his family’s citrus nursery in California’s Coachella Valley for a seasonal food-service job in Grand Teton National Park.
In 1954, his second summer in Jackson Hole, the plucky youngster made his first ascent of the 13,775-foot high Grand Teton, an undertaking he would repeat again and again. By the end of his mountain-guiding career, Newcomb could only guess how many times he had been atop the peak.
“He was never sure,” his son, Mark, said Thursday. The two estimated the lifelong count based on Newcomb’s decades of guiding.
“It was more than 400,” Mark Newcomb said.
“He devoted his career to giving people the tools they could use to build whatever they wanted out of their lives.” Mark Newcomb
Rod Newcomb moved to Jackson just as Jackson Hole was evolving from a cow, dude and tourist town on Yellowstone National Park’s doorstep to an international resort. Working first as a ski patroller in the winter and climbing guide in the summer, he founded the American Avalanche Institute in 1974, an organization that’s educated some 30,000 people.
Newcomb taught others how to climb, ski safely, guide others in the hills and forecast avalanche danger. The lessons he imparted were about more than the mountains.
“He devoted his career to giving people the tools they could use to build whatever they wanted out of their lives,” Mark Newcomb, chair of the Teton County board of commissioners, said.
“If you look at all of his summits — hundreds, if not thousands — the vast majority weren’t for him. They were for the people he was giving those tools to.”
Kept coming back
Born in May 1934, Rod Newcomb spent a couple of years of college and two years in the Army before settling in Wyoming. His folks hooked him up for summer work with a manager for the Grand Teton Lodge Company. His first season in Jackson Hole in 1953 hooked him.
“I just sort of kept coming back,” he said in a recent interview. “I was really attracted to the country. This was the place for me.”
He first wintered in the Jackson Hole valley in 1959, a time when there was, as he put it, “no winter economy.”

“Once the summer tourists left, the motel owners and café owners would get together and decide who would stay open over the winter,” Newcomb said, “and everybody else would take off.”
Jackson was “a poor little mountain village,” he recalled. Neil Rafferty was losing money running the double chairlift in the winter at Snow King Mountain, keeping it open for the locals on his summer tourist profits.
Newcomb began working for climbing guide Glenn Exum in 1963. It was the year Newcomb and other Teton climbers made their mark by pioneering a route up Denali’s East Buttress in Alaska.
Around that time he met his wife, Anne, who had been in college in Pennsylvania where she said a counselor told her of a mountain town in Wyoming “where the streets aren’t even paved.” They brought their first daughter, Lisa, home to Newcomb’s guide service summer wall tent near Jenny Lake.
The development of the Jackson Hole Ski Area, now Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, in 1964 was “the beginning of the evolution,” he said of Teton County’s change. The ski area’s European style aerial tram swung over steep cliffs and chutes — high-danger avalanche country — and the fledgling resort needed workers. Olympic gold medalist Pepi Stiegler hired fellow Austrians for his budding ski school; Newcomb signed on to the ski patrol.
After six years, Newcomb moved to a Bureau of Reclamation cloud seeding project in Colorado, designed to increase runoff from the San Juan Mountains. Snow and avalanche awareness was part of the undertaking.
Cloud seeding works, he said “but it’s not a viable way to suck water out of the clouds.” The project folded.
There was only one avalanche school in the country at the time and Newcomb thought it was inadequate for the legions who were beginning to tour into the backcountry. He began teaching snow safety and avalanche awareness in 1974 through his new avalanche institute, which he ran for 30 years.
He became a co-owner of Exum Mountain Guides in 1978. Newcomb celebrated his 55th season in the Tetons in 2009, climbing the Grand with son Mark in a day. He was 75.
Newcomb is survived by his wife, Anne, daughters Lisa and Maria, son Mark and four grandchildren.

(Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)DES MOINES — Iowa biofuels and corn experts congratulated Nebraska for its first shipments of carbon dioxide on the Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline, but said Wednesday that the development means Iowa is no longer king at turning corn into ethanol.
Monte Shaw, the executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said now that Nebraska has a functioning CO2 pipeline, ethanol plants in the state can take advantage of lucrative tax credits from the federal government and sell into the ultra-low carbon ethanol market.
“Iowa has worn the crown,” Shaw said at a new conference Wednesday. “We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years. Last week, we got knocked off.”
Trailblazer and 45z
Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline, which is slated to stretch several hundred miles and transport CO2 from ethanol plants in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming to an underground storage site in Wyoming, had its first CO2 shipment Oct. 3.
The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead sequester liquified carbon dioxide. By sequestering the carbon dioxide created in the process of turning corn into ethanol, the plants are able to lower the “lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions” of the fuel below a certain level, set by the U.S. Department of Energy, that makes the fuel eligible for a per-gallon tax credit.
These credits, known as 45z, were initiated under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. While the IRA was mostly dismantled by the Trump administration, 45z credits were extended under the Republican led tax cut law, known as the “one big beautiful bill.”
Shaw said the credits can add about 66 cents per gallon of ethanol, which is a lot for an industry that “usually tries to make a penny or two.”
Impacts to Iowa
According to IRFA, Iowa produces about 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Shaw said if each of those gallons could take advantage of the credits and add 66 cents per gallon, it would equate to more than $3 billion in added value to the industry annually.
“If Iowa wants to maintain low taxes, if we want to do further property tax reform and things of that nature, then the state needs a strong ag economy,” Shaw said. “Ethanol producers need access to the tools in this state to remain competitive with the plants around us that are moving forward.”
Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the boost to Iowa ethanol would directly impact corn farmers by increasing demand and potential price for corn, but would also “trickle down” to the state’s economy.
Farmers have faced several years in a row of high interest rates, high input costs, and low market prices for their crops. Trade wars between the U.S. and the countries where it sells ag commodities and purchases inputs have also added stress to farmers. According to a September survey from the National Corn Growers Association, nearly 50% of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis.
“The Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,” Kuiper said. “Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.”
Dave Miller, the chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said as corn yields continue to grow, farmers need a market that accounts for an extra 150 million bushels a year through 2050.
Miller said the low-carbon ethanol market facilitated by carbon sequestration could create the potential for an additional 12 million gallons of ethanol, which he said could be fulfilled by the current farming yield increases.
“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said. “So there’s a real competitive advantage that’s going to open up for Nebraska farmers compared to Iowa farmers.”
Seth Harder, CEO of two ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa, said he has seen the things in the industry that Iowa does “really great” but he also sees that the states he operates in are on the edge of a “paradigm shift.”
“As Nebraska sees this influx of funds, we hear plants are talking about not only expanding, but doubling,” Harder said.
Harder said the demand for ethanol appears to be on the rise with the recent decision from California allowing the sale of a higher blend of ethanol fuel, E-15, and the prospect of more states joining in on the trend.
Challenges
Shaw said he believes Iowa is on the cusp of a “fairly substantial farm crisis.”
“Nothing will solve this problem until we grow demand or reduce production, and reducing production would be devastating to the economy of Iowa in the Midwest,” he said.
Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. Debate on the topic caused splits among GOP lawmakers during the legislative session and has continued to be a divisive issue in the party.
The Trailblazer pipeline had fewer roadblocks than those that have popped up in Iowa. This is in part because Nebraska does not require state approval for CO2 pipelines, and because much of the pipeline was already built as the natural gas line.
Landowners and environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, that are opposed to CO2 sequestration pipelines call the Summit project a “boondoggle.” Opponents worry about property values and the safety of carbon sequestration pipelines. They have also said sequestering carbon should not qualify as a public use, which a project must have in order to use eminent domain.
Shaw said it doesn’t matter what someone thinks about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and why it should or shouldn’t be sequestered, because for renewable fuel members, this is a “business decision.”
The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is the most well known carbon sequestration project in Iowa, but Shaw said there are other companies and facilities looking for places in Iowa to sequester carbon, or to otherwise build carbon sequestration pipelines.
On the nearest horizon, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE located near Council Bluffs, is slated to connect to the Trailblazer pipeline and potentially begin sequestering carbon at the plant in late 2026.
The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline cannot begin construction in Iowa until it secures permits for storage in North Dakota and for passage through South Dakota, which has become challenging due to the enactment of a restricting law in South Dakota. The company filed to change its permit with the Iowa Utilities Commission to remove the Dakota-specific language, in the event it is able to secure a “​​better solution” for storage and passage.
Shaw said the “economic consequences” of the development in Nebraska could be a “bump in the road” for Iowa if the state adapts and brings its own carbon sequestration practices online, or it could lead to “production and demand flow from places like Iowa to places like Nebraska.”
“We’re asking the Iowa Legislature to support President Trump’s energy leadership and to help avert what I personally feel is a pending farm crisis, and to help put Iowa’s economy back on stable ground,” Shaw said.

(Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent.)A man who has insisted upon his innocence in the 2005 murder of a Missouri highway patrolman is scheduled to be executed next week, even though the jury that convicted him could not reach agreement on his death sentence. 
In most states, a deadlocked jury would have resulted in a life sentence. But Missouri is one of two states, along with Indiana, that allow judges to unilaterally choose the death penalty when a jury is split on how to sentence a defendant for a capital offense. 
Lance Shockley was issued a warrant of execution in June after exhausting state and federal processes to appeal his conviction of the murder of Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl Dewayne Graham Jr.
Graham was found shot dead in the driveway of his home in Carter County in March 2005. He had been investigating Shockley’s role in a fatal 2004 drunk driving accident, which prosecutors said gave Shockley a motive to kill him.
Shockley’s defense team argued on appeal that his trial was flawed by a lack of physical evidence or eyewitnesses placing him on Graham’s property on the day of the murder, and that Shockley was entitled to DNA testing of items from the scene of the crime that could exonerate him. 
With a clemency petition pending in Gov. Mike Kehoe’s office, Shockley’s case has stirred scrutiny of the state’s unusual judicial sentencing law. 
Anti-death penalty activists protested at the Missouri Capitol Tuesday, with some carrying signs asking, “What if we got it wrong?” 
Group of Republican lawmakers raise concerns about Missouri death penalty

At a presentation at the University of Missouri Law School later that evening, Shockley’s lead attorney, assistant federal public defender Jeremy Weis, said Missouri law puts circuit court judges — who in most jurisdictions are elected, not appointed — under “a lot of pressure” to choose the death penalty. 
“Nobody ever wins an election for county judge or circuit judge by arguing that, ‘I’m going to be fair with defendants,” Weis said in an interview Thursday.
Every year since 2018, Missouri lawmakers have considered at least one bill to repeal the law.
State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, sponsored bills in 2023, 2024 and 2025 that would have required a sentence of life imprisonment without parole in cases with deadlocked juries. This year, the bill stalled when it reached the full Senate, but she said she plans to sponsor the measure again in 2026.
“No matter what anybody’s individual belief system is about the death penalty, I think we can all agree that it should be consistently applied,” Coleman said in an interview Thursday. “And when you have one person making a decision on behalf of the state about the life and death of a citizen, I think it’s really inappropriate.”
But bills like Coleman’s have faced opposition from lawmakers who argue that current state law allows judges to ensure victims see justice for serious crimes.
Senate Majority Leader Tony Luetkemeyer, a Parkville Republican, opposed Coleman’s bill when it came up for debate in March. 
“A vote in favor of this legislation as it sits right now,” he said at the time, “is to protect some of the most heinous murderers in the state of Missouri.”
Members of Shockley’s legal team argued that, aside from the possibility of his wrongful conviction, his work as a mentor for fellow inmates over more than a decade Potosi Correctional Center should qualify him to continue that role while incarcerated.
Alyssa O’Brien, a mitigation specialist on Shockley’s legal team, said Tuesday that Shockley oversees Christian programming at Potosi and volunteers in the section of the prison housing inmates with developmental disabilities, counseling and praying with them. 
Shockley was selected for the prison’s Institutional Peer Support program, O’Brien said, which allows him to respond to correctional officers’ calls and help de-escalate when inmates are in crisis.
“Lance is looking out for the guys in the prison, but he is also helping the officers, because he’s helping maintain safety and facilitate these relationships between everybody,” O’Brien said.
Heidi Moore, executive director of Missourians to Abolish the Death Penalty, said that when she worked as an institutional parole officer stationed in Potosi in the early 2000s, the presence of inmates trusted by staff and their peers “mean[t] wonders.”
“When you get some of the younger guys that don’t know how to act,” Moore said,“they will listen to someone under a death sentence.” 
Weis said Thursday that he hadn’t heard from the governor’s office about Shockley’s clemency petition, but that he remains hopeful. This would be the first execution in Missouri since Kehoe took office in January. Under Kehoe’s predecessor, the state conducted 12 executions in six years.
“If we’re just going to say that we’re not going to give clemency to anybody who’s on death row because of the circumstances of the crime,” Weis said, “then you’re not giving anybody incentives to be good citizens, right? Might as well act out. What’s the point?”

Gretchen Whitmer signed the state’s new education budget; she also made official a number of changes to the Michigan Public School Employees’ Retirement System, or MPSERS, which provides pension and health care benefits to public school teachers. 
One of the biggest changes to that program was a $100 million cut to a program that, last year, offset a portion of the money that individual districts were required to pay into the system for pension and health care benefits of retired public school employees. 
In the Fiscal Year 2026 budget, however, that specific reimbursement was rolled into the “foundation allowance” — the per-pupil funding that every district receives based on their enrollment numbers. 
State Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), the Senate PreK-12 Appropriations Subcommittee Chair, said the decision to change that funding structure was what he considers the biggest thing that Senate Democrats had to give up in budget negotiations. 
“That line item just got pushed into the larger Foundation grant, instead of being something that directly goes to traditional school districts,” he told Michigan Advance. “I was frustrated by that, but that’s the nature of compromise.”

Thomas Morgan, a communications consultant at the Michigan Education Association, told the Advance that, all things considered, it could have been worse, but that doesn’t mean this should be a model for the future. 
“Despite losing that 1% of payroll, [school districts] still come out ahead so, as a compromise goes, it’s fine, but it’s not good policy to do it this way going forward,” Morgan said. 
The per-pupil funding has been touted by many, including Camilleri, as the highest per-pupil funding level in the history of the state, at $10,050 per student. In last year’s budget, per-pupil funding was $9,608.
But with these changes to the teacher retirement fund, some advocates are saying that’s misleading. 
“Districts are getting a little bit of extra money in this budget. It’s not a lot. In many cases, it’s not even an inflationary increase,” Robert McCann, executive director of the K-12 Alliance of Michigan, said. “But you add in these additional costs that they’re now going to have to pay, you might be putting some districts in the red in terms of this year’s budget. They may have less spending power because of all these shifts than they did a year ago, even ignoring inflation.”
Camilleri pushed back against that, saying that the per-pupil funding level is higher even without factoring in the re-allocated MPSERS money. But the impact of the shift varies district-to-district, largely depending on how many employees each school has that are eligible for coverage by the retirement fund. 

Charter school employees are largely not paid retirement benefits through the MPSERS fund, so those schools are not required to pay back into this system — but they did receive the same boost in per-pupil funding that traditional public schools received. 
“Charter schools receive the same amount of money as the traditional school districts do, but don’t pay into the MPSERS system,” McCann said. “So those systems are already tilted in their favor, meaning they get whatever they get from the state and keep all of it, and while a traditional school has to send a whole bunch of it right back to the state to cover that MPSERS payment.”
The debate over this funding boils down, in many ways, to freedom for districts to allocate their money as they see fit, with this change eliminating some of that freedom. 
“It’s a policy choice,” Peri Stone-Palmquist, the executive director of the Student Advocacy Center and the co-chair of the Michigan Education Justice Coalition’s school funding committee, said. “That diverts money away from our community schools, and takes away local control, because it’s a mandated cost, they have to pay it, and so the more you push that down into the school aid fund, the more that takes away local choices and resources for local communities.”
Local districts have seen changes to this program in their favor in previous years. For example, last year the amount they were required to contribute toward long-term retirement costs was reduced from 20.96% to 15.21%. These costs come from a gap between what the state has set aside for pensions and health care, and what it still needs to pay in the future. Because the health care fund is currently fully covered, districts have fewer costs to worry about in that area.
The cap shift also happened at the same time as the end of a 3% tax that many public school teachers previously paid into a retirement health care fund. 
State Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth), whose bill last year codified those rate changes, was also opposed in this year’s budget negotiations to the elimination of that MPSERS cost offset. 
“I’m afraid it’s a slippery slope,” he said, “that because there is such a large amount of money in MPSERS, it would tempt future legislators to try to find ways of raiding it further in the future, and that’s something I would definitely stay opposed to.
A former educator, he said that for current teachers seeing these changes, they get nervous to see their retirement funds on the negotiation table. 
“You work hard as a teacher,” Koleszar said. “That was deferred income. You want to know that the state’s going to uphold their end of the bargain when you go to retire.”

David Arsen, a professor emeritus of Education Policy and K-12 Educational Administration at Michigan State University, said that these are annual struggles between districts and the state on the proportion that each pays into public retirement benefits. 
“Give us greater discretion over the use of our foundation funding,” he said of what districts are asking. “Cut back on the number of categoricals. It’s too much. It’s too limiting. Give us some credit. Lansing, please give us some credit,” Arsen said.
Part of the lack of freedom afforded to districts by this change is the constitutional requirement for public employees to have retirement benefits — meaning that even with this change, teachers will not be left holding the bag on their own benefits. 
Jason Burns, a research specialist at Michigan State University’s Education Policy Innovation Collaborative, said the cut in MPSERS offset funding will be experienced by districts as a loss of revenues since that funding has been appropriated over multiple fiscal years. 
“Relative to the prior fiscal year this is a decrease in funding, but districts are now paying a smaller share of payroll toward [Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability] than they were 2 years earlier,” Burns said in an email. “In other words, on net the package of MPSERS funding/subsidies is less favorable to districts now than in FY25 but more generous than in FY24.”
In a long-term sense, Burns said that districts are overall responsible for far more retirement funding. 
“If we rewind the clock 30 years, the state basically covered, funded the entire system. Districts weren’t really paying into it at all,” Burns said, noting in a September 2025 report which he and PhD student Matthew Guzman prepared, that Proposal A, passed in 1994, established the current system of district and state funding for K-12 schools, including retirement benefits. 
Burns also said that many of the changes in this year’s budget were scheduled based on previously passed legislation. 
“Those are largely enacting legal changes that have been made in the last few years,” he noted. “So there’s nothing last minute that was like, ‘Oh, this is a big shock’.”
But that sentiment was not shared widely — especially since the school aid budget, which is required to be passed by July 1 each year, was not passed until early October. 
Legislature passes $21.3B school aid budget, securing school meals and increased student funds

“If this was something that they had passed in June, for example, we probably could have made it work best,” McCann noted. “But when you’re passing this in October, it means that districts were already starting off without any budget certainty.”
He added that the closed-door nature of the negotiations meant that no one, including rank-and-file legislators, had any idea what was going to be included in the budget, including the balance of MPSERS funding. 
It’s a broader concern that advocates, including Stone-Palmquist, also shared. 
“We have increased retirement loss and liabilities getting pushed onto our districts, and they’re mandated to spend that. So what that means is that there’s less and less resources for kids who need the most,” she said, referencing teacher salaries and building infrastructure as crucial needs. 
“I think our kids deserve better than that,” Stone-Palmquist said.

Jay Collins in his office in the Florida Capitol. (Photo by Livia Caputo/Florida Phoenix)The looming 2026 governor’s race isn’t about Ron DeSantis versus Donald Trump, and those hoping for “carnage” between their proxy warriors will be disappointed, according to Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.
Collins, a Tampa Republican recently elevated as DeSantis’ understudy, has long been weighing a run to succeed the governor. Since his August appointment, Collins has stood alongside the governor at a slew of press events, joined him at multiple football games, flown solo to California to extradite a non-citizen accused of vehicular manslaughter, and hosted conferences touting law enforcement crackdowns.
And yet — even though it’s one of the larger, poorly-kept secrets winding throughout the Capitol halls — Collins has not announced his run for governor. 
In a sit-down interview with the Florida Phoenix, he said Floridians might not have to wait much longer.
“We’re wrapping up our decision. I expect we’ll have a final line of what we’re deciding to do relatively soon — in the next few weeks, probably,” Collins said. “When we’re in, I promise everybody, there will be no doubt, no equivocation. We will be in it to win it if we jump in.”
He made sure to praise DeSantis as “America’s governor,” reinforcing the duo’s projection of unity even as President Trump backs a different candidate, U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, for the post. DeSantis has derided Donalds, 47, for lacking Floridian “victories” but has refused to endorse the only other high-profile Republican in the race, former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner.
The Trump-DeSantis dynamic, incredibly volatile just a year ago, has shown signs of improvement in recent months. During a press event in July celebrating the opening of the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, Trump promised that the two would be friends. Since then, Trump has endorsed Ashley Moody and James Uthmeier, two DeSantis appointees, in their bids to continue serving as U.S. senator and state attorney general, respectively.
That doesn’t mean DeSantis will come around to Donalds. He initially hinted that First Lady Casey DeSantis would be his chosen successor until scandalous financial allegations implicated her Hope Florida charity. DeSantis has since lauded Collins, a former Green Beret, and his accomplishments at nearly every press event since the veteran’s appointment, adding fuel to speculation that Collins may be his top choice.
If so, it could set up a Trump v. DeSantis proxy war in the form of the 2026 gubernatorial race.
But Collins doesn’t see it that way.
“Last I checked the calendar, we’re not there yet…”
“This isn’t about DeSantis vs. Trump. Let’s get that out of the way. This is about Florida. Period, end of story,” he said from his Capitol office, speaking from an armchair below a hanging photo of his family. 
“Gov. DeSantis is certainly not a lame duck. He is large, he is in charge, and he matters. Just like President Trump,” he continued. “But the average Floridian who supports both of them, they don’t want a choice. They want yes, that’s what the future looks like. It’s not one against the other.” 
Politico first reported that Collins might announce in late October or November. During the Phoenix’s interview, he said that although he has his family and community supporting him in a potential bid, he wants to make sure his leadership style is what Floridians need.
“I’m a very upfront, direct, bold, I would say even conversational leader, right? I like to communicate clearly.  And I want to make sure that my approach to leadership is what’s best for the state over the next eight years, if that’s what we decided to do,” he continued.
If he runs, Collins would face an uphill battle against Donalds, who’s raised $31.5 million so far. Renner has nearly $4 million in contributions and a $1 million net worth. Collins has roughly $1 million in his political committee and a net worth of $2 million. 
Collins brushed off either potential opponent, first indirectly hitting Donalds by pointing out that, historically, early apparent favorites tend to fall short.
“History shows us many things — the first person in generally doesn’t win, hasn’t won,” Collins said. “Gov. DeSantis wasn’t in the race until January. Last I checked the calendar, we’re not there yet.”
Meanwhile, Renner, who kicked off his race last month without the support of Trump or DeSantis, had told the Phoenix that he expects to win the GOP nomination by presenting a unifying conservative message amid what he expects to be a “civil war” between DeSantis supporters and Trump loyalists.
Collins criticized that approach, claiming that betting on “carnage” was something he would personally “never” do.
“I would never want to bet on the carnage between the president and the governor creating space for victory. I don’t think that’s good for Florida,” he said. “I think it comes down to our people.”

“You may not like the fact that I don’t shout and get as angry at Donald Trump as you’d like me to, but I think we’ve made more of a difference in pushing back on him than just about any state in the country,” Lamont told the crowd.

The town hall was hosted by the Stamford chapter of Indivisible, a progressive advocacy group. It was held at the Stamford Government Center in downtown. 
Lamont, a moderate Democrat, is widely expected to announce his campaign for a third term in the coming months. If he runs, he will face a more liberal challenger, state Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, in the Democratic convention next spring.
Elliott’s name did not come up during the 90 minutes of questioning Thursday. 
Aside from Trump, attendees largely wanted to know what Lamont was doing to protect immigrants, lower costs for health care and child care, and to address the state’s chronic shortage of affordable housing.
During the event, a pair of organizers with the advocacy group Sustainable Streets Norwalk held up signs urging Lamont to sign H.B. 5002 — the omnibus housing legislation he vetoed earlier this year.
Lamont continued to defend that decision, citing some of the concerns raised by local officials over a controversial proposal to assign towns a certain number of housing units they need to plan for and eliminating mandatory parking minimums.

He also said he was not ready to commit to adding a reworked housing bill to a special session that will likely take place later this year — even as he hinted that a deal may soon be forthcoming.
“There are some other things that I thought would have made the bill better,” Lamont said. “They’re not big things. I think we got them resolved, by the way.”
Matthew Silber, one of the organizers who confronted Lamont over the veto, said afterward that he was “disappointed” by the governor’s response.
“It seemed like he kind of kept walking back why he was opposed” to the bill, Silber said. “Towns have had the opportunity to take the lead for a long time, and they haven’t done so.” 
Other speakers at the town hall urged Lamont to take additional steps to protect immigrants from being pursued and arrested by federal agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One of the measures they called for was strengthening Connecticut’s Trust Act to include more courthouse protections and provisions preventing immigrants’ data from being shared with federal authorities.
Melissa Murray, a leader of the Indivisible chapter in Norwalk, said the group has delivered three letters asking the governor to call a special session to take up revisions to the Trust Act. Prior to Thursday’s town hall, she said she had yet to receive a response.
“I thought he’s been a great governor,” Murray said. “I like him a lot, but I do not see the urgency.”
Lamont declined to offer any promises that the Trust Act would make into a special session this year, though he noted that the Connecticut Supreme Court has already prohibited ICE from making warrantless arrests within state courthouse. He also apologized to the Indivisible groups for not responding to their letters.
“If we get a court order from the federal government, sometimes there’s a limitation on what we can do and who we can keep out of different facilities,” Lamont said. “But we’re trying to be as aggressive as we can, to do what I can to keep people safe.”
Lamont did offer one concession to the crowd in response to a question about his decision to follow Trump’s proclamation to lower flags to half staff following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. 
Lamont said he saw the gesture as making a point about political violence more generally, and he noted that nearly every other state had followed suit.
Still, he added, “I have second thoughts about it today.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Lamont_Town_Hall-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243

It could be worse.,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/10/ct-coffee-prices/,"In 2020, the price of a pound of roasted ground coffee in U.S. cities averaged $4.43. In August 2025, prices hit $8.87 per pound.","An estimated two-thirds of all Americans drink at least one cup of coffee a day, but the cost of it shot up in recent years and may continue to rise under high tariffs imposed by the U.S. on coffee-producing countries.
In 2020, the price of a pound of roasted ground coffee in U.S. cities averaged $4.43 according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But in 2024, prices averaged $6.32 per pound, and the most recent data from August 2025 shows prices hit $8.87 per pound.
Connecticut, like the rest of the nation, is seeing sharp increases in coffee prices. According to data collected by Toast, an operations platform that thousands of restaurants and food vendors across the country use, the price of a hot cup of coffee increased 7.7% in Connecticut from 2024 to 2025. Some states saw increases as high as 11%. 
A variety of environmental and economic factors contributed to initial price increases, but tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could push prices even higher.
In July, President Donald Trump announced a 40% tariff on Brazil. However, a 10% tariff was already imposed in April on Brazil, along with many other coffee-producing countries, as a part of the administration’s “Liberation Day” tariff package.
While dozens of countries produce coffee, Brazil makes up 37% of all global coffee production. A report published in June by the USDA found that Brazil’s coffee production has fluctuated over the past five years due to drought and high temperatures, lowering crop yield. Vietnam, the second-largest coffee producer worldwide, also saw crop fluctuations due to drought and high temperatures.
“Vietnam is reduced 1.1 million bags to 29.0 million as drought conditions limited output,” reads the report. 
Brazil is also down in production by 1.7 million bags from initial USDA estimates due to drought and high temperatures.
Initial rises in prices came from the shock the global supply chain felt during COVID, according to a release from the BLS.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-5.03.51-PM-1024x671.png,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243

Meanwhile, the state is juggling a goal of 220,000 new housing units to beat the crunch while trying to plan for a world with more extreme weather, be it floods or fire.","CONSIDERING COASTAL AND inland flood projections, and with the Bay State still a relatively low fire risk compared to western states grappling with waves of destructive blazes, the future in Massachusetts looks more dangerously wet than dry. But housing experts warn that a heating planet and persistent drought conditions call for a long-view approach to planning where and how new housing gets built across the country.  
Faced with a housing crunch, they say, people will move where they can based on the information they have – even if that area might be more susceptible to climate risk in the future. 
Migration patterns show many Americans making short-term affordability decisions that ignore long-term climate risks, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. “People are moving into places with higher fire risk, and out of places with higher flood risk,” she said. When cost drives housing decisions, people can be “myopic,” prioritizing immediate affordability over future burdens. 
“It’s really difficult for people to take [climate risk] fully into account because we have this tendency to consider information that is known and ignore information that is unknown,” Fairweather said. Most people “don’t have a good way to translate fire risk into cost,” she said. The amount of risk can “be kind of random,” because “even climate risk scores aren’t going to tell you if your house will be flooded or burn down, or if the houses around you are going to burn down.” 
Massachusetts experienced that randomness last year, when an unusually dry and flammable fall saw 1,300 wildfires burn across the state. This August was the 20th driest since 1895, though paling in comparison to the record-breaking warm summer of 2024, when more acres burned in October and November wildfires across Massachusetts than in the past two years combined. 
Climate research shows that while Massachusetts is projected to receive more annual precipitation overall, summers will experience more variable and severe dry spells due to rising temperatures and less frequent rainfall. Against this backdrop, the state is juggling a goal of 220,000 new housing units to beat the crunch with the need to plan for a world with more extreme weather, be it floods or fire. 
More than two million Massachusetts residents live in areas of drought, according to the federal National Integrated Drought Information System. At the conclusion of a “notably dry” August, the state declared most of Massachusetts to be in “significant drought.”  
And where there is drought, which leaves root systems and surface fuels like leaves dry, fire tends to follow.   
“Massachusetts is preparing for a future where flooding, heat, and wildfires are more common,” said Maria Hardiman, spokesperson for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. “We’ve seen a persistent drought for the past few years, increasing the likelihood of wildfires closer to densely populated areas.” 
About 45 percent of Massachusetts homes are in or near areas at wildfire risk, “meaning that any significant wildfire event may put people and property in danger,” the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife declared last November.  
Yet, the Bay State usually rates low on the National Wildfire Risk Index, which compares an area’s relative wildfire risk to that of the entire US. In the index, FEMA considers building value and population size at risk of experiencing a wildfire, estimated annual frequency of wildfires in a year, and the percentage of buildings or population expected to be lost in a wildfire.  
More dispersed areas like Berkshire and Franklin Counties and the more urban Suffolk County are considered very low fire risk while Worcester, Essex, Middlesex, and Plymouth counties are considered relatively low fire risk and a pale blue on the maps. This is a sharp contrast to states like California, where the FEMA maps turn scarlet around Los Angeles areas with the highest relative fire risk in the country.  
FEMA’s national wildfire risk map, as of October 10, 2025.
That doesn’t predict fluke years like 2024, when 200 wildfires burned across Massachusetts in October alone – a  significant spike from the typical 15 fires the state sees each October. Fire departments battled blazes across multiple communities simultaneously, from a 188-acre fire in Middleton to a 140-acre blaze straddling Salem and Lynn, while the Massachusetts Air National Guard deployed helicopters for water drops. 
Insurance companies are attentive, noting that fire seasons are also striking the Northeast. The region is more densely populated and includes more tightly packed buildings than, say, the Carolina coasts where wildfire risk has been crawling north over the past few years. 
Fires that leaps from wild brush and forests into the areas where houses and wildland meet “in the northeast have a much greater potential to cause rapid conflagration,” the financial services company Moody’s warned in December. Moody’s specifically noted the vicious fire season in Massachusetts and Connecticut – both states with among the lowest relative fire risks. 
Insurance agency Marsh McClennan, noting the rising natural disaster rate in northeastern states, also pointed to unusually long periods of drought as a rising risk. The agency recommends more spending on mitigation and more aggressive proactive measures from individuals, businesses, and state and local governments. 
“Homeowners are already having to put their own money into houses to make them more resilient to climate change,” Fairweather noted.
In Massachusetts, Barnstable, Essex, Plymouth, Hampshire, Norfolk, and Hampden counties are all vulnerable to wildfires, according to the state’s ResilientMass Plan, which rolled out in 2023 and outlines priority resilience actions. Areas with pitch pine and scrub oak trees are the most fire prone. 
As droughts become more frequent and severe, forest types that do not usually burn and are not fire adapted will be more likely to burn, according to the plan, which notes wildfires are projected to increase worldwide by 14 percent by 2030, 30 percent by 2050, and 50 percent by 2100. 
Gov. Maura Healey did not include drought management policy in her sprawling environmental bond bill this year, though the bill did add climate risk experts to the Board of Building Regulations and Standards, which establishes the state building code and determines how resilient new development should be. 
Separately, the ResilientMass Plan recommends the state take several steps to mitigate wildfire risk including improving firefighting infrastructure, creating a statewide wildfire training program, and better managing fire-prone ecosystems. As of October, work has begun only designing and building wildfire management operations facilities at Hopkinton State Forest and Douglas State Forest and creating a comprehensive facility climate resiliency needs assessment.  
These projects were not identified for funding in the bond bill, though communities have been receiving new federal and state wildfire prevention grants since the record-breaking fires of last year. The next round of the EEA-managed drought resiliency and water resiliency grant program is coming soon, according to the state. 
Massachusetts does not currently have plans to introduce restrictions on where homes could be built based on wildfire risks. The Office of Housing and Livable Communities has mostly focused on climate hazards like flooding or extreme weather.  
Housing advocates in Massachusetts say fire risk is a fairly distant concern, since the groups are usually focused on infilling development in urban areas rather than brush, farmland, or forests where wildfire risk runs highest. 
And when it comes to new construction, Jesse Kanson-Benanav, executive director at Abundant Housing Massachusetts, noted that “modern building construction, especially multi-family construction, is more fire resilient than old construction.” 
But, Heather Clark, former senior director for building sector climate policy in the Biden White House, warned at the recent pro-housing YIMBYTown conference that insurance market failures will reshape American housing – and not just in obvious high-risk zones. 
“In 10 to 15 years, we will not have mortgages in large parts of our country because we will not have insurance,” Clark said. “That is not in areas that are just coasts where hurricanes are, that is not just where wildfires are. When insurance markets fail, they fail across entire regions and entire states.” 
She cautioned against setting safety and climate resilience aside in favor of only boosting production. 
“When I was at the White House, we heard all the time we can’t spend $1 more on emissions reductions, energy savings, or resiliency, because that would mean one less unit of housing for people in need,” she said. “You’re not doing anyone a favor by putting people in harm’s way by building housing in harm’s way.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC_0536-e1650488411418.jpg?fit=1024%2C847&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243

(Photo courtesy of city of Eagan)A lawsuit filed by Minneapolis-based law firm Robins Kaplan LLP Thursday alleged several local and county officers ignored critical medical symptoms that led to a man’s death in November 2024.
Filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of the family of the late Kingsley Fifi Bimpong, the law firm sued three Eagan police officers, seven Dakota County correctional officers and Dakota County for the death of the 50-year-old Cottage Grove resident. The lawsuit alleges the officers acted with “deliberate indifference” over the course of about five-and-a-half hours while Bimpong grew gravely ill in custody.
Rosalind Marie Lewis, the mother of Bimpong’s child, and Josephine Adu-Gyane, a cousin, are seeking $120 million in compensatory and punitive damages. The case demands a jury trial.
Bimpong’s final hours were captured by police officers’ body cameras and the jail’s surveillance system. At many times, the complaint states, Bimpong was confused, unable to communicate, and lacked bodily control, which are all early indications of a stroke.
“The shocking deliberate indifference from local authorities stripped Kingsley of his last safeguard: the right to basic medical care,” said Katie Bennett, a Robins Kaplan attorney, in a statement.

The 72-page complaint meticulously details Bimpong’s experience while with law enforcement, from his initial confusion at an evening traffic stop on Nov. 16, 2024, to losing the function of his right arm at the Eagan Police Department and urinating on himself while he laid on the floor of a Dakota County Jail holding cell on Nov. 17, 2024.
The inaction from law enforcement and their failure to seek medical care in response to stroke symptoms resulted in Bimpong’s death, according to the lawsuit.
As of Thursday afternoon, the Eagan officers had not yet been served with the complaint, said attorney Vicki Hruby on behalf of the city of Eagan. Hruby denied that Bimpong showed signs of immediate medical attention during the officers’ interactions with Bimpong on Nov. 16, 2024.
“While Mr. Bimpong’s death is tragic, he was not exhibiting an objectively serious medical condition that was obvious to lay persons at the time he was in the Eagan officers’ custody and there no indication that he required emergent medical treatment,” Hruby said in a statement.
Eagan Police Department
The complaint alleges that Bimpong’s health emergency was immediately evident when Eagan police officer Joseph Moseng stopped Bimpong after he drove into oncoming traffic and onto a median on Nov. 16, 2024. Bimpong was leaving his job at the U.S. Postal Service with what the complaint described as a headache and “decreased vision.”
Body camera footage of the incident shows Bimpong struggling to communicate with the officer, the complaint says. Bimpong couldn’t say his own name, what city he was in, or who the president was, according to the lawsuit.
Eagan police officers Liam O’Shea and Martin Jensen soon joined the scene and found that Bimpong did not have a criminal history and had no evidence of drugs or alcohol in his car, according to the complaint. They attempted to perform a field sobriety test, but Bimpong was unable to complete it as he couldn’t understand officers’ directions or walk properly, the lawsuit says.
Jensen, a “drug recognition evaluator” whose training includes additional hours to thoroughly identify drug impairment, did not perform the full 12-step evaluation to determine if Bimpong was intoxicated — no pulse or vital signs were evaluated, the lawsuit alleges. 
Rather than address Bimpong’s apparent health condition, the officers arrested Bimpong and took him to the Eagan Police Department where they worked to obtain a search warrant for his blood, according to court documents. The case stated that while the officers discussed the possibility of Bimpong suffering a medical issue, they did not seek care.
It was during this time that Moseng spoke with Bimpong’s employer at the post office and learned that Bimpong had left all his belongings at work, one of his coworkers thought he was “losing his mind,” and he had been complaining of a headache, according to the lawsuit. The officers also observed Bimpong’s right arm lose its proper function at the police department, the complaint says.
According to the Mayo Clinic, the first signs of a stroke include a headache, weakness in the arm, problems seeing and trouble walking.
The complaint states that when Moseng asked Jensen if Bimpong should receive medical care, Jensen responded defensively and said doing so would result in a transport hold that requires one Eagan officer to stay at the hospital. Jensen purportedly said Bimpong had taken a dissociative drug, the claim states.
Throughout the traffic stop and procedures at the police department, the officers were intermittently muting their body cameras, which the claim states is against the city’s policy. 
A city of Eagan policy from 2020 states: “Officers may temporarily pause the recording or mute the audio to exchange information with other law enforcement officers or legal counsel.”
When Jensen and Moseng prepared to transport Bimpong to the Dakota County Jail, the lawsuit states that Jensen muted his equipment just as Moseng told him, “Before you got there, I was like, ‘Is this dude having a stro—’”
The complaint alleges that Moseng reacted to having admitted this to Jensen by pulling his winter hat over his face, shrugging and either laughing or smiling.
Hruby, the attorney representing the city of Eagan, noted in her statement to the Reformer that Bimpong “exhibited signs of drug intoxication, including unsteady gait, confusion, and a thousand-yard stare.” Hruby also said that Bimpong spent 17 minutes with medical professionals before being transported to the Dakota County jail. 
Dakota County Jail 
Moseng and Jensen transported Bimpong to the Dakota County Jail around 1 a.m. on Nov. 17, 2024, about two hours and 15 minutes after the initial traffic stop with Eagan police. Jensen said that Bimpong had “no issues” upon arrival, the lawsuit claims.
According to the lawsuit, the video surveillance captured at the jail was limited. Although common in other state facilities, the surveillance at Dakota County Jail did not include audio recording or time stamps, the complaint states. The lawsuit also alleges that the county kept select videos from Bimpong’s time at the jail.
The lawsuit names the following correctional officers as defendants in the case: Eduardo Decache, Brittany Corbin, Ramsey Strickland, Manuel Hernandez, Heather Hedden, Christopher Severson and Lucio Manuel Marquez Zazueta.
During the intake process, the officers noted that Bimpong had a language barrier, but the lawsuit states Bimpong spoke English and the problems in communication were caused by his health emergency. The booking papers also note that Bimpong’s medical questionnaire “could not be completed,” the lawsuit says.
The intake process at the jail included Bimpong being assessed by a full-body scanner, but Bimpong was unable to enter the scanner himself. Video footage shows correctional officer Decache forcefully pushing Bimpong into the machine, the lawsuit says. 
Video footage shows at least two men helping Bimpong move through the facility during the intake process, as Bimpong seemingly could not move properly on his own. 
Alone in the holding cell with one wall made of windows, Bimpong attempted to use the bathroom but hit his head and fell down, exposed, according to the lawsuit. The footage shows Bimpong outstretched on the floor reaching toward the door. The lawsuit says he remained on the floor for about 45 minutes, while officers are alleged to have been conducting wellness checks and deeming the inmate and the cell OK.
After nearly two hours in the holding cell, Bimpong urinated while on the floor, soaking his pants, the lawsuit says. Footage over the next hour and a half shows Bimpong’s condition worsening as he continued to roll on the floor with a lack of bodily control, according to the complaint. Still, multiple correctional officers conducted wellness checks and noted that Bimpong was OK, the lawsuit says.
After three hours and 22 minutes in the cell, correctional officers Corbin and Decache discussed Bimpong’s wellbeing, though Decache assured Corbin that Bimpong had been acting the same as he had all night and that the situation was fine, the complaint states. 
The lawsuit describes Bimpong as foaming at the mouth at this time.
Minutes later, the lawsuit says, Decache and a nurse entered Bimpong’s holding cell and found him unresponsive. The complaint says Kingsley’s pupils were “pinpoint, fixed, and non-reactive to light.” Additionally, the lawsuit says his tongue was white and protruding from his mouth, while he continued to foam at the mouth; his feet were gray.
Emergency Medical Technicians arrived soon after, and Narcan was administered three times without any effect, indicating there was no drug intoxication, the lawsuit says. A Hastings ambulance arrived at the jail at nearly 5 a.m. and correctional officers carried Bimpong limb-by-limb to a gurney. 
At a local hospital, testing showed Bimpong had a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage. “In other words,” the lawsuit reads, “[Bimpong] had a massive brain bleed that had caused his brain to shift and his brain stem to squeeze out of the bottom of his skull.”
With a condition too severe for the local hospital to treat, Bimpong was then transferred to United Hospital around 9:30 a.m., where doctors diagnosed additional severe conditions and neurosurgery indicated it was not possible for Bimpong to improve, the lawsuit reads. 
Bimpong remained in the hospital until his death was reported on Nov. 19. An autopsy revealed Bimpong died of a stroke, and the only medications found in his body were those he received at the hospitals.
According to the lawsuit, a Department of Corrections investigation into Bimpong’s death found that no correctional officers on staff were up-to-date with their first aid and CPR certifications. Training hadn’t even been offered at the facility since 2022.

The American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education gave the Upstate college the initial approval it needed in the accreditation process to begin enrolling students. The school will accept applications over the next five weeks, with the window to apply closing at midnight on Nov. 17, according to a statement from the college.
Dean Steven Marks has said he expects to enroll 80 students — 60 South Carolinians and 20 from other states.
The first veterinary students will begin classes in fall 2026.
The school will still need another round of approvals before it is fully accredited.
“Today is a very exciting day for Clemson University and the state of South Carolina,” university President Jim Clements said in a statement. “The Harvey S. Peeler Jr. College of Veterinary Medicine’s application window is now open, and we are one step closer to welcoming our very first Doctor of Veterinary Medicine students to campus.”
How Clemson University is starting South Carolina’s first veterinary school

The college is building the $285 million project, funded with money set aside in the state budget, to address a potential shortage of veterinarians in South Carolina, particularly in rural and agricultural communities.
South Carolina has more than 2,700 licensed veterinarians and more than 900 technicians, according to the state licensing board. That’s up from more than 1,700 vets and 380 technicians a decade earlier.
“Our mission is to prepare world-class veterinarians who will advance animal health, support agriculture and strengthen communities in our state and beyond,” Marks said in a statement. “The students will be prepared to enter the workforce on day one after graduation or pursue their education further to become specialized.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cropped-Clemson-School-WL-Photo-1024x627.jpg,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-10 14:12:01+00:00,CT Mirror,"Shutdown forces Medicare patients off telehealth, hospital-at-home programs",Tim Henderson | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/10/shutdown-medicare-telemedicine-telehealth/,"Both programs are for Medicare recipients, but some physicians have stopped booking telemedicine visits for any patients.","The federal government shutdown is forcing a reckoning for two remote health care programs because they automatically expired Oct. 1.
The telehealth and in-home hospital care programs were both temporary — but increasingly popular — options for Medicare recipients. They allowed doctors and hospitals to bill Medicare for telehealth appointments and in-home visits from nurses to provide care that is generally only available in hospitals.
The shutdown has prevented Congress from extending them.
More than 4 million Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth services in the first half of the year, according to Brown University’s Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research.
As of last fall, 366 hospitals had participated in the hospital-at-home program, serving 31,000 patients, according to a federal report. The program, officially called Acute Hospital Care at Home, allows patients who would otherwise be hospitalized to get inpatient care at home with a combination of nurse visits, monitoring equipment and remote doctor visits.
The programs have their roots in the pandemic, when doctors and hospitals wanted to keep patients safe from the risks of travel and hospital stays. Both are for Medicare recipients, generally people over 65 or who are disabled. But since many private insurers follow federal guidelines, some physicians have stopped booking telemedicine appointments for non-Medicare patients, rather than risk a change in insurance coverage.
Alexis Wynn, who is in her mid-30s and covered by private insurance through her employer, tried to switch an in-person doctor appointment in Pennsylvania to a video visit last week. The office told her that “all telemedicine is uncovered by insurance as of Oct. 1” — so she had to cancel the routine appointment.
“It was just a follow-up appointment  to make sure the dosing of my medication was still accurate, nothing that was pertinent to being face-to-face,” Wynn said. Her health insurance company later told her it still covered telehealth visits.
There have been other reports of insurers turning down non-Medicare telehealth appointments, said Alexis Apple, director of federal affairs for the American Telemedicine Association, a trade group.
“It’s a misunderstanding,” Apple said. “I’m not really sure what’s happening, but it’s unfortunate and very scary. There’s so much uncertainty out there now, and we see insurance payers start to pull back.”
Both telehealth and home hospital services can be a lifeline for older people, especially in rural areas, where residents may struggle to travel long distances for health care in person.
“In rural America, it’s often telemedicine or no medicine at all,” said Dr. David Newman, chief medical officer of virtual care at Sanford Health in South Dakota, in a September statement supporting congressional action to make Medicare telehealth permanent. Bipartisan bills that would have allowed telehealth to continue stalled in committee earlier this year in the Senate and House.
There’s an exception for telehealth rural residents — but only if they travel to a brick-and-mortar health care facility to get the remote health care service.
“The patients have to go to a clinic to receive that telehealth visit from a provider in a different location,” Apple said. “It kind of defeats the purpose.”
According to the Brown University report, California had the highest rate of Medicare telehealth usage in the first six months of this year, with 26% of beneficiaries using at least one telehealth appointment, followed by 23% in Massachusetts and 21% in Hawaii.
There’s no reason for non-Medicare insurers to stop covering any telehealth visits during the shutdown, and even most Medicare Advantage programs will continue to cover telehealth, according to Tina Stow, a spokesperson for AHIP, a health industry trade association.
Nevertheless, at least some health care centers are refusing to take new telehealth appointments or are converting existing ones to office visits.
“This is causing a lot of confusion. We are still working with our members who are insurers and providers to get a gauge on what folks are doing — because at this point reports we’ve seen seem to suggest it is company by company, provider by provider,” said Sean Brown, a spokesperson for the Health Leadership Council, representing CEOs of health care firms and insurers.
The hospital-at-home program serves a smaller number of patients but its pause has caused more disruption: The federal government required patients to be discharged from the program or transferred to a brick-and-mortar hospital by Oct.1.
The Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic had 30 patients in the program in Arizona, Florida and Wisconsin — all of whom either had to be released from the program or sent to brick-and-mortar hospitals. One of Mayo’s hospitals in Florida was already over capacity and had no room for transfers, according to reporting by Becker’s Hospital Review.
In Massachusetts, which requires commercial insurers to follow Medicare guidelines, all insured patients had to leave the program. Mass General Brigham, which operates many hospitals in the state, has rejiggered its plans to create more home care without relying on the hospital-at-home program, according to the Becker’s report.
Congress was unable to avert a shutdown by late September, and some individual providers and patients were caught unawares.
Nurses on social media discussed losing home-care jobs or being reassigned overnight when the hospital-at-home program closed Oct. 1. They worried about patients being taken away from children at home, or placed in hallway beds at overcrowded emergency rooms because of the abrupt change.
“Management scheduled a random call this morning with a super vague title. Then drop the bomb on us,” wrote one poster in Texas. “So no job. Perfect!”
In a direct message, the poster, who didn’t want their name used for fear of getting in trouble at their hospital, told Stateline, “This obviously wasn’t ideal for the patients. One of them had four children and now could no longer be home with them. Some didn’t even get to have a bed in the hospital because there were none available and had to stay in the ER in a hallway bed.”
Parkland Health System in Dallas started tapering off its hospital-at-home program in September because of the impending shutdown, and the last patients were discharged from the program by Sept. 30 without returning to the hospital, spokesperson Wendi Hawthorne said.
“We are hopeful that Congress will renew this innovative model of care in the future,” Hawthorne said.
Likewise, OSF Healthcare in Peoria, Illinois, had started to wind down its hospital-at-home program “to avoid needing to return multiple patients to a very crowded facility,” said Jennifer Junis, president of OSF OnCall, which handles home hospital care.
There were only three patients in the program Sept. 30, all of whom were ready to be discharged without returning to the hospital, Junis said. Since the program’s start in 2020, it has helped 980 patients with home care through OSF’s Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria.
“It is unfortunate that we will not be able to benefit by treating qualifying patients at home, where they are most comfortable and recover faster,” Junis said. “Our digital hospital program has allowed us to free up beds for our sickest patients who need them most.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. Senate has unanimously approved a bill that would allow Alaska Natives to continue sales of traditional ivory art in states that have passed laws banning the ivory trade.
The ARTIST Act, by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, is intended to address state-level bans that were instituted to limit demand for elephant ivory but have also affected products made with mammoth and walrus ivory, marine mammal bone or baleen produced by Alaska Natives.
Harvesting and carving walrus ivory is legal under federal law, but Sullivan said that laws passed by different states have dissuaded tourists from buying ivory art when they visit Alaska. 
The Senate passed the bill without dissent on Tuesday, and it advances to the House for further action.
In a speech on the Senate floor, Sullivan thanked his fellow senators for approving the bill, which was introduced in 2024 but did not pass into law before the new Congress began in January. Sullivan reintroduced the bill, and it advanced through the Senate anew. 
“States have gone too far and cast this huge net and have said you can’t buy any ivory products anywhere, including Alaska Native products from Alaska walrus … this really has hurt my state, Sullivan said.
“This is a simple bill. If a visitor wants to come buy some ivory earrings in Alaska … and bring them home to a state with a ban on ivory … we want to be able to say at the federal level that we should be able to do this,” he said.

region. John McCosh/Georgia Recorder (file)This coverage is made possible through a partnership between WABE and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
Georgia has cut its greenhouse gas emissions per person nearly in half in the last 20 years, mostly by replacing coal power plants with natural gas and solar. But the state still has a long way to go to cut emissions enough to make a dent in climate change, according to a new analysis by Georgia Tech researchers in partnership with Drawdown Georgia. 
Georgia’s net emissions totaled 92 megatons in 2024, down from 141 megatons in 2005.
The state’s carbon dioxide emissions per person dropped by 45% from 2005 to 2023, the third-largest reduction in the country according to the Energy Information Administration. The Georgia Tech analysis found a 49% drop by 2024.
Report author Marilyn Brown, a professor at the Carter School of Public Policy at Georgia Tech, said the decline is especially impressive because in the same period, the state’s economy has boomed.
“What we’re doing is proving you can grow your economy, you can grow your population and reduce your emissions,” she said.
Georgia’s net emissions – the amount of carbon dioxide put out minus what’s absorbed by carbon sinks like forests and marshes – dropped by 33% from 2005 to 2024, while the state’s GDP grew by 127%, according to Brown’s analysis. That means the carbon intensity of Georgia’s economy, a measure of emissions per unit of economic output, dropped by 71%.
But the state still has a long way to go to further cut emissions, which is key to fighting climate change. Meanwhile, Georgia Power is extending use of its remaining coal plants and adding natural gas capacity, which produces less carbon dioxide than coal but does still generate greenhouse gases. 
And residential use of natural gas has actually increased. Electric heat pumps are popular in rural areas without access to gas, Brown said, but Georgia’s cities aren’t switching to them as quickly.
“Heat pumps pay for themselves rapidly, but people are afraid to retire an operating gas system,” she said.
Transportation emissions – now Georgia’s leading source of greenhouse gases – are about the same as in 2005. Emissions from diesel trucks have increased, thanks to a booming freight sector and the increasing popularity of online ordering and deliveries, the report finds.
Delivery vehicles could be a potential bright spot in the years to come, though, according to another report by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, looking at electric vehicle trends in the region. Sales of non-passenger medium- and heavy-duty commercial electric vehicles soared in Georgia in the last year, leading the country with more than 3,000 vehicles sold. The SACE report credited that trend largely to delivery and cargo vans.
The Georgia Tech report lays out recommendations for further cutting emissions, including expanding EV adoption and further electrifying freight fleets, further decarbonizing electricity with large-scale solar and storage, and electrifying buildings. 
It also highlights the state’s carbon sinks like forests, which go a long way to offsetting Georgia’s emissions.
“We are sinking as much CO2 almost as the magnitude of our transportation sector’s emissions,” said Brown. “It’s very big, so we need to protect that.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Atlanta-traffic2.jpg,,,2025-10-10 09:56:40.545669

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)A George Mason University report released Friday looks at how Virginia can meet its mandatory goal of decarbonizing the state’s utility providers while also getting more localities on board for certain energy projects. It comes as Virginia faces critical energy demands as ratepayers and lawmakers consider how to meet those needs and make utility bills more affordable. 
The report projects that Virginia will see an 8%increase in energy demand by 2030 and a 20% increase by 2035, driven largely by the growth of data centers and manufacturing. In 2023, the commonwealth was the top energy importer from other states. Nuclear power is providing the heaviest lift of energy production in the state, with natural gas and solar increasing the most in bringing power online.
Adjunct Professor Paul Bubbosh of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason said the report is meant to be practical in light of the state’s energy needs. He said with challenges like the loss of federal incentives for renewable energy projects and supply chain holdups, the state will have to rely on natural gas in part during the interim.
“The complicating factor is that solar and wind are on a levelized cost of energy basis cheaper than natural gas and coal and nuclear power,” Bubbosh said. “However, with the added cost of supply chain issues, it further complicates the picture.”
Natural gas is also facing supply chain challenges for proposed gas plants and with fossil fuels continuing to be a scarce commodity, it will add to the steadily increasing fuel costs, Bubbosh said.
Bubbosh encourages utilities to ramp up their efficiency efforts and consider data center advancement that will allow them to pull less power off of the grid. Under the VCEA, Appalachian Power was expected to make a 2% reduction in energy consumption by 2025, while Dominion was told to reduce by 5%. Dominion has not met those goals and additional reductions will be determined by the State Corporation Commission every three years.
“Virginia has not met its targets in energy efficiency, so it needs to do a lot more in terms of getting consumers to reduce consumption during peak periods,” Bubbosh said.
States nationwide are struggling to fully understand how much power data centers will actually need in the coming years. Many projects are often thrown into the queue before financing or other permits are secured; some data centers may not actually materialize. The GMU report suggests requiring more details of a project to be locked in before the energy demand begins to be calculated.
“One of the key difficulties with a lot of these large load centers is the financing. So they now need to demonstrate that they have the financing in place and that they’re ready to go and that should improve things,” Bubbosh said.
The regional grid operator PJM has taken heat from most of the governors in the coverage area for slow walking the approval of connection permits, largely for solar and wind projects. Some of the leaders believe this is leading, in part, to higher utility bills because energy projects are waiting to be put on the grid. 
PJM has pointed to supply chain issues slowing down certain projects already in the queue and delaying their actions. They have also made some reforms to ramp up their permitting process.
But Bubbosh said the real focus should be put on rural Virginia communities, to educate them on renewable energy projects, their own energy needs, and how they can meet their own demand while respecting the local culture.
“The pathway to energy security in Virginia runs through rural Virginia. It’s imperative that the Commonwealth’s government understands that to achieve lasting results, we need to bring those in Virginia, whom we’re asking so much of, such as their land, to be part of the conversation,” Bubbosh said.
There have been efforts to create a framework for statewide assistance for local regulations around energy projects. Currently, it is up to local boards of supervisors to vote if a solar, wind, gas, or nuclear project can move forward and what the related ordinances will entail. In some counties, the boards have approved a power-hungry data center project application and denied a solar farm proposal the same night. 
The GMU report urges local grassroots movements to aid in creating community energy-need assessments to help rural communities understand which projects need to be built out to keep their own lights on, rather than sending power up north to Data Center Alley.
“The problem with Virginia is legislators are trying to ram through siting requirements at the state level. That will backfire, and you will get greater resistance to large scale solar deployment,” Bubbosh said. “So what we’re trying to do is to say, if you really want to achieve lasting results and energy security, you’ve got to bring on rural Virginians.”
The report suggests expanding solar projects in Northern Virginia where the power need is the greatest. Then the energy will be right at the source of the need. Once the northern parts of the state’s infrastructure has been sufficiently expanded, it would be easier to ask other communities to build out their energy infrastructure.
“Then I believe it would be appropriate for Virginia legislators to turn around and say, ‘Look, we all want to keep the lights on. We have exhausted the full potential in Northern Virginia and now we want to turn our attention to, let’s say, the Southside, or Tidewater’,” Bubbosh said.
Their goal with the report and recommendations is to aid state and local governments in moving forward with solid plans on how to meet the growing energy demands, no matter which party is dominant in the legislature or who occupies the Governor’s Mansion. That will help move the needle on siting issues, researchers hope.
“One administration is gonna come in and they’re gonna want to favor these technologies, A, B, and C. Four years later, another one’s gonna come in, and you’re gonna go back and forth,” Bubbosh said.
Bills spelling out how the state may aid communities in their energy plans are expected to be filed in the next regular legislative session, beginning in January.

Max Calfo, who lost the Republican primary for the 108th District in 2024, said this week that he has documents proving the incumbent, state Rep. Mike Costlow, lied on his candidate declarations last year. Calfo has, since early 2024, been working to obtain court records from Georgia showing that Costlow pleaded guilty to a felony theft charge there in 2008.
The records were released Sept. 12, when Judge Gregory A. Voyles of Lowndes County, Georgia, found “the facts show that the defendant entered a plea of guilty,” and there was no restriction on releasing all the court records.
State Rep. Mike Costlow, a Republican from St. Charles County.
Costlow took 60% of the vote in the 2024 primary against Calfo. He is seeking re-election and Calfo also intends to file for the seat next year.
Last year, Calfo tried to get Costlow thrown off the ballot based on the guilty plea, but he did not have the document he has now and the case was dismissed. Since obtaining the document, he said, he has filed a complaint with Secretary of State Denny Hoskins that Costlow lied when he signed a declaration of candidacy, under penalty of perjury, stating he had no past felony convictions or guilty pleas.
Hoskins’ office did not respond to an inquiry Thursday about the complaint.
Asked why he has continued to pursue the issue long after the primary, Calfo said he feels cheated.
“I think it is the fact that he defrauded his voters and disenfranchised mine and that really lit a fire under me,” he said.
Costlow, in an interview with The Independent, said he expects Calfo to sue him again. He declined to discuss the specifics of the Georgia charges or Calfo’s new documents, citing the likelihood of being in court again. But he insists he did not lie on the declaration. 
“He’s just trying to find some sleazy way to become a politician, and that’s the kind of action that the voters hate, quite frankly,” Costlow said.
When Calfo first became a candidate in the west St. Charles County district, the incumbent was state Rep. Justin Hicks. Calfo obtained documents about a 2010 domestic violence case against Hicks in St. Louis County, published them on his campaign website and was in return sued by Hicks.
Instead of filing for re-election, Hicks filed in the Republican primary for Congress in the 3rd District. Costlow entered the race when Hicks declined to run again.
The disputes within the district haven’t been confined to Calfo and his direct rivals and the old Georgia case isn’t the only criminal charge.
On Wednesday, Hicks’ mother-in-law, Elizabeth Sparks, will be in court in St. Charles County to learn her trial date for charges filed in July 2024 accusing her of harassing Calfo and filing a false report. 
In the probable cause statement, a detective from the O’Fallon Police Department accused Sparks of “falsely reporting the victim allegedly sexually assaulted juvenile females to damage (Calfo’s) reputation.”
Sparks admitted she lied in the report, the detective wrote.
Max Calfo, candidate for the Republican nomination in the 108th Missouri House District (photo submitted).
The new records available from the Georgia case will, Calfo said, become the basis for a challenge to Costlow’s qualifications to be a candidate if he files for re-election.
Missouri law disqualifies any person seeking to run for elective office “who has been found guilty of or pled guilty to a felony” in the state, in federal court or in another state. If the offense occurred in another state, it must be a crime that would also be a felony in Missouri.
In 2024, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that the disqualification applies in cases where the candidate had been pardoned by the governor. While the pardon eliminated the conviction from the candidate’s record, the opinion stated, “it did not erase the fact that he pleaded guilty to a felony offense.”
In Costlow’s case, Georgia court records provided by Calfo show he was charged with theft by agreeing to take a paintball gun, barrel kit and $150 in trade for an expensive paintball gun but reneging on the deal. Costlow was charged with two similar counts and pleaded guilty to one.
Costlow, the documents show, was placed in a diversion probation program for first offenders. His successful completion of probation means, Voyles wrote in the Sept. 12 ruling, “may not be used to disqualify a person in . . appointment to office in … the public sector.”
Whether the law disqualifying candidates with a felony conviction applies to members of the legislature is a question that has not been addressed in court. The Missouri Supreme Court decision was about a candidate for a county commission seat, an office created by statute.
The Missouri Constitution only requires that representatives be a voter for two years, residents of their districts for at least one year, and at least 24 years old. State senators must have been a voter for three years and 30 years old.
Calfo said he will seek to enforce the law if Costlow files for office again.
“On March 22, 2024, he swore under oath that he had never pled guilty to a felony in a separate state and that is indisputably not true,” Calfo said.
“There is really nothing sleazier than lying to the public about one’s past,” Calfo added later.
Costlow, in response, said Calfo has been trying, unsuccessfully, to get him arrested, calling police agencies in Jefferson City and St. Charles County, as well as asking the FBI to get involved.
“Everyone recognizes him for what he is,” Costlow said. “So frankly, I’m not worried. He’s just a thorn in the side.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_mocapitol1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-10 09:56:40.545669

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking Indigenous Peoples’ Day off and will return to your inboxes Tuesday.
When the town council of Los Altos Hills approved construction of new apartment buildings two years ago, it was a big deal for the affluent Santa Clara County community, writes CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.
For decades the mansion-studded town permitted the construction of only one type of building, single-family homes, and no more than one per acre. But now Los Altos Hills — where the average home price is $5.5 million — is having second thoughts, and the events that are unfolding underscore how local governments continue to push back against state requirements to develop more affordable housing.
Due to state mandates, town officials begrudgingly approved the development of Los Altos Hills’ first-ever affordable housing units since its incorporation in 1956. They chose an area along Interstate 280, known as Twin Oaks Court, and California housing regulators signed off on this plan in the spring of 2023. 
But earlier this summer, the town council voted to cut the number of planned new homes by nearly two-thirds. Officials and residents say the proposed changes still meet state requirements, and that the original plan would obstruct emergency access areas, worsen traffic and disrupt local wildlife.
State regulators are expected to respond to the town’s proposals by today, but pro-housing advocates have denounced the potential changes.

The California Housing Defense Fund, in a September letter to the California Department of Housing and Community Development: “It is grossly inappropriate for the Town to carve back its most important low-income site. … Local agencies should not be allowed to amend their housing elements the moment that they are confronted with a real housing development project.”

The dispute is being closely watched by other well-to-do cities that are proposing — or have proposed, to varying degrees of success — altering their own state-approved development plans, including Carmel and South Pasadena.

Cooling down those mobile homes 🧊

From CalMatters’ environmental justice reporter Alejandra Reyes-Velarde:
Californians who live in mobile homes will soon have the right to install cooling devices, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 806 into law on Tuesday. 
Advocates for residents say lease provisions and park rules have sometimes banned air conditioning units. Tenant advocates at Legal Aid of Sonoma County, a sponsor of the legislation, said they were surprised such restrictions were legal. The bill was carried by Assemblymember Damon Connolly, a San Rafael Democrat.
Caitlin Vejby, a housing policy analyst with the organization, said the law will save lives. Many mobile home residents in Californians are low-income, elderly or have health conditions that make them vulnerable to extreme heat, and three-quarters of mobile home parks are located in inland areas, some of the hottest regions of the state, she added. 
Starting Jan. 1, tenants whose landlords don’t follow the rules can sue for damages and attorney fees. Landlords could also pay a $2,000 civil penalty.

A jury found him not guilty of murder by reason of insanity after he stabbed a 6-year-old child to death. (Kentucky Department of Corrections)The child killer whose Oct. 1 release from a Kentucky prison sparked outrage on social media and criticism by the Trump White House is back in custody.
Ronald Exantus, 42, was arrested in Florida on Thursday and charged with failing to register as a felon. Florida law requires convicted felons to register with the sheriff’s office within 48 hours of release or entering a county.
The Marion County Sheriff’s Office in Ocala announced it arrested Exantus at a home in Marion Oaks on Thursday and that he is being held without bond in the Marion County Jail.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said Florida officials are working to send Exantus back to Kentucky.
Exantus admitted fatally stabbing 6-year-old Logan Tipton in 2015 after driving from Indianapolis where he lived to Central Kentucky and entering an unlocked home in Versailles where the Tipon family was sleeping. Exantus killed Logan with a butcher knife he found in the house.
After his arrest, Exantus entered the Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center at the state prison in La Grange. At trial a psychologist testified that Exantus, a dialysis nurse, was in a psychotic state at the time of the killing. A jury in Lexington acquitted him of capital murder and burglary but found him guilty but insane on charges of assaulting other family members.
He was sentenced to 20 years on the assault charges and became eligible for release in 2026 based on credits he earned in prison for good behavior and other activities. He was released early under a 2012 Kentucky law aimed at reducing recidivism by providing mandatory re-entry supervision as inmates make the transition to life outside prison.
He was to remain under supervision in Florida until June under an interstate compact. As a condition of his supervision he was required to report to a parole officer immediately upon his arrival. The Marion County Sheriff’s Office did not say whether Exantus had reported to a parole officer as required.
Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods said, “I am proud of the quick response by my deputies and the inter-agency teamwork that helped locate and arrest this disgusting individual. The fact that he was living right next to an elementary school is even more repulsive. I have no tolerance for this type of dangerous person flaunting our laws and thinking he would hide out in our county.”
Threats against Parole Board still under investigation
Earlier Thursday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said the FBI has joined the Kentucky State Police in investigating violent threats made against members of the Kentucky Parole  Board in response to Exantus’ release.
The Parole Board had unanimously recommended on Sept. 30 and previously that Exantus remain in prison but lacked the authority to keep him there, according to the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet.
Kentucky State Police Sgt. Matt Sudduth, speaking during the governor’s Thursday media briefing, said threats of violence are not protected under the First Amendment and can be criminal. “We’re going to continue this investigation, and if we can, when we get to a point where we’re ready to hold those accountable, that’ll be the next steps in the investigation,” Sudduth said.
Beshear said his office has not been contacted by the White House about Exantus’ release. Last week White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reposted criticism by a right-wing podcaster, saying, “I can confirm the White House is looking into this. It’s wholly unacceptable for a child killer to walk free after just several years in prison.”
Beshear chastised Leavitt for pushing out what he called “wrong information” and putting the “lives of our Parole Board members in danger.”
Beshear also said, “If you are calling and leaving one of these racist violent messages for our Parole Board members, they were trying to do what you wanted them to do. They made the decision the way that you claim that they should have. And there’s just no acceptable reason to ever threaten another human being with violence.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-16-e1759873943605-1024x455.jpg,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)More than six weeks have passed since Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office announced the State of Nevada had been breached by cyberattackers and Nevadans are still in the dark about the scope of the damage done, or whether the state has paid a ransom.
Cybersecurity professionals say investigations of incidents of this scale will likely take months, so it’s expected that additional information is not available, but some worry information might be downplayed or delayed for political purposes.
On Aug. 24, the governor’s office announced a “cyber incident.” All state agencies, including the Department of Motor Vehicles and social services offices, were physically shuttered for at least two days. All state agency websites were taken offline in what the governor’s office described as a proactive and precautionary measure.
For weeks: The agency that processes Medicaid, SNAP and TANF applications reverted to having new applicants fill out paper forms; mandatory background checks for firearms were unavailable, halting legal sales and transfers for anyone without a concealed carry permit;  law enforcement databases containing information about criminal records and registered sex offenders were  inaccessible; and businesses like car dealerships and smog check shops that use DMV databases experienced delays and issues.
Greg Moody, director of the cybersecurity program at UNLV, called it “the largest state-focused attack in modern history.” Others in the cybersecurity world have described it as an unprecedented attack.
On Sept. 12, the governor’s office announced that “90%” of public-facing state agency websites had been restored. Since then, the governor has provided no additional updates.
On Monday, the recovery update page set up by the state displayed a banner stating all state agency websites have been restored and the recovery page will no longer be updated. It’s unclear when that banner went up, and the governor’s office did not directly respond to the Nevada Current’s question asking when the last state website was restored.
“All major constituent-facing services are back online, and Nevada is operational again,” said Josh Meny, the governor’s press secretary, in an emailed statement. “Our agencies are diligently working to resolve any intermittent back-end issues, but the majority of these issues are not directly attributable to the cyber incident but are instead linked to other recent enhancements aimed at strengthening and securing our cyber environment.”
Some specific features of agency websites may still be down, but no full accounting of that is publicly available. As Meny put it, “it may be challenging to precisely quantify the minor adjustments currently being implemented by agencies” but the state “is actively compiling an inventory of these efforts.”
The governor’s office did not directly respond to questions about additional details on the cyber attack, including what ransom was demanded by the attackers, and whether that ransom was paid by the state.
“The state remains committed to transparent communication and will share a final update once all efforts have been successfully completed,” said Meny in the statement.
Moody from UNLV says it’s not surprising there hasn’t been additional information released. Nevada is working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI on the investigation, and one or both of those agencies is likely the lead, he says.
It takes a lot of time and effort to retrace electronic actions, says Moody, and investigators must preserve evidence for possible prosecution.
“It makes the process go slower,” he added.
Meny, for the governor’s office, emphasized that the state still “has not seen evidence of any constituent PII (personally identifiable information) being compromised in this attack.”
He added, “As Governor Lombardo has previously said, if investigators eventually discover otherwise, the state will follow Nevada’s strict statutes about personal data breaches by notifying any affected individuals promptly and providing resources to help protect them.”
The state has previously said that data was exfiltrated — meaning taken off the state’s system and moved elsewhere. But it has not said what that data entailed.
Moody notes Nevada Revised Statute includes a strict definition for “personal information.” To meet the definition, the data must include a full or partial name as well as another element, such as a driver’s license number or password information.
If the information was encrypted, it would not meet the state definition, he added, because there’s “some reasonable assurance” that attackers would not have access to it.
Moody says the attackers could have gotten information that does not meet the state’s definition of personal identifiable information, or they could have been exploring how the state’s centralized IT system is set up in hopes of replicating an attack elsewhere.
“Who knows,” he said, “Until we know the hacker and the motivation it’ll be hard to know what they were looking for.”
Lombardo in an earlier press conference has described the incident as a ransomware attack, and he has suggested the motivation was a financial ransom.
While some states have passed laws banning the paying of such ransoms, Nevada has no such law.
“They could have cut a deal or paid a ransom,” said Michael Leonard, a former IT professional and publisher of Mike’s Reno Report who’s been following the cyberattack. “‘Keep quiet and we’ll give you money.’”
Leonard is critical of the lack of info, acknowledging that while the investigation must be taken into account, the state still needs “to come forward with enough information to ensure us they’re investigating and credible.”
He suspects the silence is as driven by politics as much as by the investigation itself.
“I would say it’s equal motivation,” said Leonard. “To protect the reputation of government officials and elected officials.”
“There are unanswered questions and we should be asking them,” he added.
Lombardo is up for reelection next year and considered one of the most vulnerable governors in the nation. Candidate filing does not begin until March, but Attorney General Aaron Ford is currently considered the frontrunner to challenge him, though Ford faces a Democratic primary first.
Democratic legislative leaders expressed criticism of Lombardo in the days immediately after the cyberattack but have remained relatively quiet on the issue since.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager on Sept. 9 announced he would form a legislative working group on cybersecurity. His caucus did not respond to the Current’s request Thursday for an update on that effort.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/waitingforlombo-1024x774.jpg,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

(Photo courtesy Maryland Transit Administration)During its 2022 session, the Maryland General Assembly passed and former Gov. Larry Hogan signed legislation that provided up to $1.2 billion for the Baltimore Orioles and Ravens to upgrade their home stadiums. The case made by the two franchises was that these funds were necessary to keep Major League Baseball and NFL football in Maryland’s largest city.
Although some observers identify cities and urban areas as “major league” if they house the highest level of professional sports, we believe sports franchises by themselves offer an incomplete definition of the phrase. For the Baltimore region to truly be a major league urban center, we believe it must have a major league public transportation system.
Unfortunately, years of underfunding have kept Baltimore’s transit system stuck in the minors with a losing record. The current system demoralizes current riders, discourages new ones and damages the Baltimore region in multiple ways. Unreliable bus and rail service means workers don’t get to employment sites on time and risk losing their jobs; public school students miss valuable class time; senior citizens and others with medical needs are late for appointments; while shopping, culture and recreation are out of reach for far too many.
And for all the funds spent on the two stadiums, getting there on public transportation often means long waits on packed platforms while more people are stuck in game-day traffic congestion as a result.

This situation also undermines our region’s ability to attract new businesses and residents. U.S. Census data shows that until it recorded a very modest gain this past year, Baltimore was the only major East Coast city that continued to lose population while our peer cities — including Boston, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., New York and Atlanta — gained population. A major difference between these cities and Baltimore is their robust public transportation systems, and the density and enhanced livability that such systems support.
While each of them has challenges, those systems provide much more frequent and reliable service than Baltimore transit riders typically experience.
But it’s not just Baltimore households without cars (at least 30% in Baltimore City) that need better transit service. Indeed, many Baltimore-area residents would love to drive less or trade their cars for a Charm Pass if bus and rail service were frequent and reliable, thereby saving money that could be used for housing and other living expenses.
The good news is that the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA), under the leadership of Holly Arnold, released a new strategy this summer for vastly improving public transportation in the Baltimore region. It’s called Bmore Bus and, if implemented, would transform the daily experience for Baltimore-area transit riders.
Why? Because 80% of MTA’s ridership is on its buses. And while MTA is replacing its aging Metro subway cars and received funding from Gov. Wes Moore and the General Assembly to replace its chronically breaking-down light rail cars by 2032 or 2033, investments in the bus system will have by far the biggest and earliest impact on the day-to-day experience of current and potential riders.
We know the upcoming Maryland General Assembly session will occur during a challenging budget environment, but we also know that governments always find a way to fund what they value. At least four of our sister states in the Northeast Corridor — including Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania — have created or identified new revenue sources for the public transportation systems in their largest urban regions.
So can we! Remember the $1.2 billion Maryland found to pay for the stadium upgrades? MTA’s projected cost to implement the Bmore Bus plan is $1.1 billion.
And while the two stadiums combined are used fewer than 100 days a year, Baltimore-area residents, businesses and institutions rely on our transit system 365 days a year!
We believe it’s time for Maryland to value public transportation and those who currently use it or would choose to use it if service were frequent and reliable.
We also believe Gov. Wes Moore when he says, “You cannot have a thriving Maryland if you don’t have a thriving Baltimore.” The Baltimore region is Maryland’s population center, economic engine and cultural mecca … and it’s time we had the major league transportation system our residents, businesses and institutions need and deserve.
The Baltimore region needs Major League Transit … NOW!",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MTA-Buses-1.jpg,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

A 2022 law gives many of them a chance to expunge their record and make greater contributions to their communities.,"Guest Commentary written by

Joanna Hernandez
Joanna Hernandez is the director of strategic partnerships at the San Francisco Pre-Trial Diversion Project and owns a barber shop with her family in Contra Costa County.


At 15, I became a mom. Desperate to make money to support my baby, I got involved in drug sales and theft. I cycled in and out of the criminal justice system until I was 23. 
Community programs in San Francisco helped me turn my life around. Today, I work for a nonprofit that connects people in county jails to diversion programs, which help them make similar transitions. And as founders of Freedom Braiders, my daughter and I lead programs that teach the art of hair braiding and offer cognitive behavior classes in jails.  
Although the mistakes of my past do not define who I am today, my old record still stands in the way of simple things, such as passing a background check so I can volunteer at my grandchildren’s school.
I am one of the 8 million Californians — that’s 1 in 5 people — living with a conviction record. Having an old criminal record creates all kinds of barriers. It hinders our ability to find jobs, housing and an education, and often keeps us stuck in a cycle of post-conviction poverty.  
Californians now have the chance to permanently expunge old conviction records. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law in 2022 that makes many old conviction records eligible for expungement, as long as a person has fully completed their sentence and has had no further contact with the justice system.
As part of my job, I visit county jails each week and I meet women with stories similar to mine. I can envision how much promise their future holds —  if they can clear their records. I see this work as an opportunity to show them that their community will not give up on them, that they deserve a second chance. 
Most just want a chance to make a living. That’s where the idea of barbering comes in. 
While they are in jail or just leaving it, we train them to become a barber or a braider, so they have a skill to utilize when they get out. Many student barbers who come through my family’s barber shop are either formerly incarcerated or have a conviction. 
This is my family’s way of paying it forward. 
Roughly 30% of jobs in California require a person to be licensed, and many of those licenses are off-limits for people with old convictions. 
With barbering, a criminal conviction doesn’t automatically exclude formerly incarcerated people from getting licensed, but the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology has discretion. That inevitably puts some people at a disadvantage and makes getting a conviction record expunged even more important. 
Now 49 years old, I started my expungement process a few months ago. I had put it off for decades because I was afraid of being rejected. 
I attended an expungement clinic, where lawyers helped me prepare the paperwork. I’ve submitted my request for expungement and, though the process can take several months, I’m looking forward to starting fresh with a clean record and continuing to give back to the community. 
I owe my second chance to mentors at two organizations, Mission Girls and Alive and Free. They showed me a different path was possible.
Joe Marshall, co-founder and violence prevention leader of Alive and Free, always told me, “The more you know, the more you owe.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/091823-Tulare-Jail-LV_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

Depends how you measure it,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/proposition-50-communities-split/,"Prop. 50 would enact a congressional map that helps Democrats, but a new analysis finds it doesn’t change Californians’ representation much on other measures.","In summary
Prop. 50 would enact a congressional map that helps Democrats, but a new analysis finds it doesn’t change Californians’ representation much on other measures.


There’s no question that the proponents of Proposition 50 have a partisan goal.
By seeking to adopt a map to put more Democrats in power in areas currently represented by Republicans, they are asking voters to temporarily bypass the state’s independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission, which for the past two decades has prioritized maps that keep similar communities together and provide more electoral opportunities for communities of color. 
Does that mean that the proposed new congressional districts would be less representative of voters, beyond party preferences? We looked into some common questions.
Who drew the Prop. 50 map? 
Paul Mitchell, a veteran Democratic redistricting expert in Sacramento, and a group of similar consultants drew the map. Mitchell explained in an interview that he took input from California’s Democratic congressional delegation before sending a proposed map to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
The committee then sent the proposal to the state Legislature, which adopted the map as part of its vote to put Prop. 50 on the November ballot. The proposition would allow the state to temporarily use those proposed district lines. 
Isn’t California already gerrymandered?
Not quite. 
Many Republicans, including Vice President J.D. Vance, already complain that under California’s current map, Democrats control over 80% of congressional seats even though the party got just under 60% of statewide votes in the 2024 presidential election. 
But that doesn’t mean the maps are intentionally drawn to give Democrats an unfair advantage.
Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly two-to-one. The citizen commission that drew the maps, composed of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans as well as four independents, were specifically forbidden from considering party registration in deciding how to draw the lines. They did have to consider geography, and Democrats and Republicans don’t live in an even distribution across the state. Plus, several of the current blue districts are highly competitive, with the incumbent Democrats winning them last year with razor-thin margins.
Two academic institutions that rate states’ redistricting plans say California’s current map is  mostly fair. PlanScore found the map is tilted toward Democrats by two measures and balanced by two other measures. Princeton University’s Gerrymandering Project gave California’s map a “B” score on partisan fairness, docking it only for giving incumbent politicians an advantage. (The proposed new map got an “F” from the organization.)
Would the new map further divide communities?
Both proponents and opponents of Prop. 50 claim their favored map – the existing one or the proposed new one – keeps cities and counties together more often, resulting in better representation by keeping similar communities under the same congressmember. 
So which is it? It depends how you look at it, and each side phrases their claims differently. The proponents of Prop. 50 are correct in saying their map splits fewer total cities and counties into two or more districts than the current map. That’s according to analyses of both maps by HaystaqDNA, the firm that assisted with the nonpartisan redistricting in 2021. 
An analysis by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found that difference to be nearly negligible.
But the Democrats’ map has more cities and counties that are split among three or more districts, rather than only two. That’s why opponents are also correct in saying Prop. 50 splits communities more times — though in their argument mailed to voters, they overcounted the number of times. 
But keeping cities and counties intact isn’t the only way to judge the quality of a congressional district.
For starters, big cities have to be split into multiple districts to ensure that each congressmember represents the same number of people. Both maps give each district 760,066 Californians, give or take one constituent.
Plenty of California cities are split in both maps because the state constitution requires independent map-drawers to consider not just keeping cities and counties together but also “communities of interest,” which the law defines as “a contiguous population which shares common social and economic interests” that should be in one district to be represented fairly.
In any region that could mean everyone who sends their kids to the same school district, or everyone who works in farming, or everyone who relies on I-5 for their daily commute. But there’s no set definition of all communities of interest, so once you consider them, it becomes a matter of opinion how well each map represents Californians.
Prop. 50’s opponents have highlighted Lodi, a 66,000-person city north of Stockton currently represented in one congressional district that would be split among three districts under Prop. 50. The Lodi City Council opposes the measure.
Mitchell said the split stemmed from efforts to strengthen a northern Central Valley district for Democrats by moving in more voters from Stockton. The resulting shuffle forced Lodi residents to be split up, but also unified Antioch and Martinez residents into one district and Vacaville and Solano County together in another. All four of the latter cities and counties are split up under the current map. 
“It’s a tradeoff,” he said. “You could have competing communities overlapping. Which one’s more important?”
But opponents say those tradeoffs should only be made with public input and without partisan goals. In deciding which cities, counties and communities to keep together or split up, 2021 independent redistricting commission member Patricia Sinay said the commission held numerous hearings and received tens of thousands of written comments. 
“Saying one splits more than the other, it’s not that informative,” said Sinay, a political independent who opposes Prop. 50. “What did the people want? What did the communities of interest ask for?”
How does Prop. 50 affect representation for people of color?
In the weeks leading up to the election, opponents have highlighted regions that Prop. 50’s maps would split up against local community leaders’ wishes.

In a press release issued by the other No on 50 campaign funded by House Republicans last month, local politicians in Temple City and Azusa denounced the proposed maps for drawing lines through Asian American and Latino communities in east Los Angeles County. 
But in general, the proposed map doesn’t actually change much, according to the analysis by PPIC. 
If there are enough minority voters in a region to make up the majority of a congressional district, it could trigger the federal Voting Rights Act, which requires states to draw districts protecting the communities’ ability to elect representatives of their choosing. There are 16 such congressional districts in California, all with a majority of Latino voters. 
Other concentrated racial communities that don’t have enough numbers to be in the majority still have districts that are drawn with their interests in mind, like Asian voters in east Los Angeles County, or Black voters in south L.A. In six districts, Asian voters are at least 30% of the population — enough to influence an election. California also has two districts where Black voters reach that threshold and seven where Latino voters do. 
Prop. 50 wouldn’t change any of that. The public policy institute even found the proposed map would add one more district where Latino voters make up at least 30% of the population. 
“Some communities may have complaints about specific lines drawn by the proposed plan,” senior fellow Eric McGhee wrote. “But the plan as a whole is very similar to the current one in most respects: it deviates mostly by creating more Democratic seats.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/110822_ElectionDayLA_PU_CM_40.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

Details of services
A music-filled service of remembrance and celebration will be held for Larry at 2:00 PM on Saturday, November 15, 2025 at Centre Congregational Church in Brattleboro, VT. A reception will follow at the Guilford Community Church in Guilford, VT.

The Reverend Dr. Larrimore C. Crockett, 92, died in his home in Dummerston, Vermont on September 10, 2025, surrounded by family. 
Larry was born March 2, 1933 in Aurora, IL, and spent his early years living in the Midwest. The son of the Reverends Barney C. Crockett and Olga Winter Crockett, he carried the family’s ministerial tradition into a long and respected career as a religious scholar and beloved preacher in the United Church of Christ. After completing seminary at Chicago Theological Seminary he was ordained to the Christian ministry in 1957 in Dummerston, Vermont. He divided his time serving church communities in Vermont and Rhode Island, earning a Ph.D. from Brown University in 1966, where he also served as Chaplain.  
In the early 1970s he was Associate Professor of Religion at Keuka College (Keuka Park, NY), and Visiting Professor of Religion at Lawrence University (Appleton, WI). In 1973 Larry moved with his family back to Vermont where they built a home on the side of Black Mountain in Dummerston, a place he loved very much. Between 1973 and 1994, he enjoyed a rich employment experience in area churches and higher education. He taught and served in administrative roles at Windham College and Southern Vermont College. He served the Vermont Conference of the United Church of Christ, as Moderator of the Windham-Union Association. He helped create the Vermont Academy of Spiritual Training (VAST), and served on its faculty for several years. In later years he was the Pastor-in-residence at Chicago Theological Seminary and adjunct faculty at Bangor Theological Seminary. 
In 1980 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Humanities by the College of St. Joseph, Rutland (VT) in recognition of his contributions to higher education in Vermont. From 1985-1997 he was Assistant Minister of the Guilford Community Church, serving with his wife, Shirley, who was the minister. This partnership and ministry in Guilford was one of the most satisfying experiences of his life and led to his writing a history of the Guilford Church, Safe Thus Far, which was published by Black Mountain Press in 1998 and dedicated to Shirley. He subsequently published books of Shirley’s children stories, The Mended Cup (2003), I Invite the Children to Come Forward (2010), her pastoral prayers, Be Present Here (2008) and several volumes of family history. 
Larry enjoyed researching and writing about his understanding of religious thought and published articles in academic journals throughout his early life. Later, he turned to writing about people who had an impact on his life and in 2010 he wrote and published a history of the Blanche Moyse Chorale, More Than Thirty Years of Glorious Sound. For over seventeen years he maintained a blog at vividreports.blogspot.com. His sermons were grounded in scholarly research but he was able to convey his messages of radical love, inclusion, and forgiveness through language and stories that connected meaningfully to his parishioners’ lives. Larry continued to be active in local congregations for the entirety of his life. His kindness, his thoughtful manner, and his sincere interest in others were blessings to all who knew him. 
One of Larry’s greatest passions in life was his love of music. He served as director of church choirs in Guilford and Dummerston and brought his resonant bass voice to many music projects in the region. He was a longtime member of the Blanche Moyse Chorale and participated in several world music groups such as The River Singers where he met his second wife, Ellen Tolles. On June 19, 2005 they were married and embarked on a musical adventure with their shared passion. Immersed in a loving church and music community they explored multiple genres of choral music from classical pieces to hymns and traditional folk song and brought comfort to people in Hospice care, senior homes, and hospitals through their work with the Hospice-related chorus, Hallowell.  
Larry was active in his community, serving on several boards in the Brattleboro Area including Brattleboro Hospice, the Brattleboro Music Center and Sojourns Community Health Clinic. He was deeply concerned about local, national and world issues. He participated in the Selma-Montgomery March in 1965, was a frequent participant in anti-Vietnam war demonstrations in the 1960s and 1970s and supported environmental and sustainability issues. 
He was predeceased by Shirley Harris Crockett, his wife of 43 years; his brother Stewart Crockett of Elgin , IL; and his daughter, Betsey Crockett Shay. In addition to his wife, Ellen, he is survived by his son, John Crockett (Cynthia Hughes), of Westminster West, VT; his granddaughter, Katherine “Katie” Shay of St. Louis, MO; several nieces and nephews and their families; and, through Ellen, a large family of children, grandchildren and siblings.  
Larry found his highest fulfillment in caring for and nurturing others, both individually and in organizations, through his beloved family, his many friends, his vocation as a minister, teacher, counselor and administrator, his community involvement, and through his singing. His family extends their deepest gratitude to those who brought Larry delight and peace in his last days through companionship and song.

Under Connecticut law, landlords must accept at least one method of payment — for rent or security deposits — that does not involve a service fee, like a check or a money order.
Digital rent payments, like those made online with a credit card, debit card or ACH transfer, often incur a processing fee. These service fees are usually between 1% and 3%. 
Sections 47a-4c of state law specifies landlords are prohibited from requiring electronic funds transfer as the exclusive form of payment for any lease or rental agreement executed on or after October 1, 2013. If a tenant wants to avoid service fees, a money order or a check can be used.

(Getty Images)Suicide is a leading cause of death in Utah and across the U.S., and veterans are at higher risk of suicide-related death. 
Meanwhile, research shows veteran service organizations have been having a difficult time engaging with some of the most at-risk veterans and their families and getting them mental health or suicide prevention resources. 
To help address those challenges, a new report from the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute surveyed what Utah’s veterans say are their biggest barriers. 
The issue, the survey found, is complex. Some veterans wrestle with what the report called the “warrior ethos,” or fear that they’ll be seen as “weak.” But other obstacles, researchers wrote, are “more systematic, such as wait times and fear that accessing services could limit military careers.”

Kara Byrne, senior health and human services analyst at the institute and lead author of the report, said in a prepared statement that the report “highlights the critical role of personal connections in reaching service members in need.” 
“By focusing on building trust and addressing systemic barriers, the state can improve access to these life-saving resources,” Byrne said. 
The study was commissioned by the Utah Department of Veterans and Military Affairs, which in conjunction with state officials, is “committed to reducing suicide and improving mental health among service members, veterans, and their families,” the department’s executive director Gary Harter said. 
“This valuable research shines a light on where we need to focus our prevention efforts,” Harter said. “One life lost to suicide is one too many.”
Findings
Survey respondents were asked to select the “greatest or biggest barriers to accessing mental health services or suicide prevention resources for you or others in the military community.” Here’s the breakdown of their responses (the sample size for the survey was 1,376, according to the report): 

33%: “It takes too long to get into care.” 
29.8%: “I can take care of myself.” 
27.3%: “My friends, family, or community will know my business.”
22.1%: “Exposing my mental health could keep me from advancing my career.” 
21%: “Others will think I am weak.” 
19.8%: “Too expensive.”
17.2%: I am unsure how to access resources.” 
15.9%: “Services are not helpful.” 
15.1%: “Other.”
10.5%: “Services are not available in my area.” 
5%: “Exposing my mental health could keep me from being deployed.” 

The report also highlighted that accessing resources for veterans remains a challenge, with 25% that have never looked for resources and 17% that are unsure how to access them. 
Additionally, researchers found veterans tend to trust their non-military and Veterans Affairs affiliated physicians and therapists, along with their family and friends and military peers. Trust in services, however, varies. Only 36% reported they personally trust mental health crisis response resources like the crisis line or 988, while over 50% of those who had called the crisis line found it helpful. 
Based on focus groups, researchers suggested some of the best ways to reach active service members or veterans include better coordinating efforts among federal, state and community initiatives, according to the report. They also suggested “reducing the stigma” with mental health services by “addressing misinformation that receiving such services could impact their military career.”

Mackey said that Alabama could see its biggest public school enrollment drop in 40 years. (Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s public school enrollment could see its largest decline in 40 years, Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey told members of the Alabama State Board of Education on Thursday. 
Enrollment in the state’s K-12 schools in the 2024-25 school year was 729,242, a slight increase over 2023-24. The department did not release numbers Thursday for the 2025-26 school year, but Mackey said Thursday only about 12 schools have seen growth in enrollment while other districts have seen numbers decline.
About 5,000 students have been unenrolled from public schools in the state with roughly 3,000 students total taking CHOOSE Act funds to go to a private school.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that offers families up to $7,000 per qualifying child for education related expenses including private school tuition. The program currently operates under income caps scheduled to be lifted next year.
“We know a portion of [the students] took CHOOSE Act dollars and we’re working with the governor’s office and the Department of Revenue to figure out exactly what that number looks like,” he told board members.
The department is expected to release final numbers next Friday.
The loss of students is a nationwide problem. In May, the National Center for Education Statistics projected that there would be a decline in public school enrollment, due to growth in private and charter school enrollment and the general aging of the population. Nationwide, public school enrollment is expected to fall by 7.6% by 2031. Alabama’s 
Mackey said Thursday he was mostly concerned with the 2,100 students who were enrolled last year that never showed up for school.
“They didn’t transfer to private school, they didn’t go to home school, they didn’t go to school in another state. They just disappeared,” he told the School Board of Education.
Mackey said local superintendents have reported to him that a majority of the unaccounted students are Hispanic.
“We don’t know if they’re still living in this state, just not going to school. If they have moved to another state, they did not enroll in school in that state,” he told the board. “If they left the country, we don’t know if they are documenting students or undocumented, because, as you know, that’s something we are not allowed to ask, and we don’t ask under federal law.”
According to the ALSDE, about 12% of students enrolled in Alabama public schools are Hispanic. 
Mackey said getting these students back in school is important for their progress.
“If those students all come back to us in January and they missed a semester of instruction, we’re going to teach them, but we’re going to pick them up where they are,” he said. “I would implore, publicly, [for] parents to get them back in school. The sooner they get back in school quicker, we can catch them up and move them forward.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7543-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

Omar Fateh isn’t afraid to walk away.
Fateh was infuriated by the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party’s public messaging during the fraught days of Israel’s 2023 counterattack on Hamas, accusing his DFL colleagues of tolerating Islamophobia.
Three days later, Fateh sent an email to Senate leadership inquiring how to change his party affiliation.
“Is there a formal process to switch party/caucus affiliation to independent? If so, please provide me with those details. Thank you,” Fateh wrote in a Nov. 22, 2023, email reviewed by the Reformer and first reported here.
This wasn’t the first time he threatened to decamp, according to a person with knowledge of Fateh’s maneuvers and granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak by their employer. He threatened to leave at least two other times, once in 2022 over a personnel issue and again amid a heated 2023 negotiation over a bill to give Uber and Lyft drivers a hefty raise.
He never left the Senate DFL caucus, but the implied threat underscores Fateh’s political style — marked by a refusal to be a typical go-along-to-get-along lawmaker and a willingness to aggravate his colleagues and big players at the Minnesota Capitol if that’s what it takes to get his priorities through.
Not five years after his first election, Fateh is now a leading contender to be Minneapolis mayor, challenging Mayor Jacob Frey. As mayor, his political acumen would be put to the test amid the city’s fierce factionalism, where progressives and moderates and labor and business are debating the city’s identity and future.
Fateh would be the city’s first Somali-American and first Muslim mayor of the state’s biggest city in what would be a symbolically important victory for Minnesota’s immigrant communities while also likely drawing backlash from nativists, including President Donald Trump.
Other major candidates include Jazz Hampton, an attorney and entrepreneur, and DeWayne Davis, a minister.
The two-term Minnesota senator is running on his legislative record of advocating for working families and immigrant communities. He championed the Uber/Lyft law and led the creation of a program that funds free college tuition for Minnesota families that make $80,000 or less.
Fateh’s campaign didn’t make him available for an interview with the Reformer. When asked about Fateh’s inquiry about leaving the Senate DFL caucus, a campaign spokesperson said Fateh “has always remained a committed member of the caucus, and does the hard work to make sure we are always standing up for the values Minnesotans share. What this really shows is conviction, not a negotiation tactic.”
“Sen. Fateh pushes harder for the people he represents,” his campaign said.
Sen. Jennifer McEwen, DFL-Duluth, a fellow democratic socialist, praised his courage in the face of the pressure to conform at the Capitol.
“There’s so much pressure to just lose your fight, lose the fire in your belly that caused you to run in the first place and just kind of become a part of that club, and he has not done that,” McEwen said. “He’s maintained his loyalty and his focus on advocating for the people of his district, and that is so unique within our political system.”
While his willingness to be disagreeable in the service of his constituents has notched legislative victories, at other moments it’s frustrated his Senate colleagues.
At the end of the 2024 legislative session, Fateh was absent from the Senate floor for over 10 hours as he waited for a better offer on the Uber/Lyft bill. While the clock ticked toward the mandatory adjournment for the year, Democrats were unable to pass the rest of their agenda.
Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, said at the time he called Fateh and coached him “not to go too far.”
“I care about the things he was pushing for, and I was trying to help him,” Marty said.
Calls to over 10 other Senate Democrats were not returned. 
In 2022, Fateh misled Senate Democratic leaders about his familial relationship with a campaign volunteer who was convicted of perjury in connection with a wider federal investigation into ballot fraud during Fateh’s own 2020 DFL primary. The man convicted was Fateh’s own brother-in-law.
This ordeal led to an ethics investigation, but the complaints were largely dismissed.

From a primary upset to ethics issues
Fateh was first elected in 2020 to represent a south Minneapolis Senate district after upsetting prominent lawmaker Jeff Hayden in the primary.
Fateh was a democratic socialist looking to upend the establishment. He supported a statewide $15 minimum wage and defunding the Minneapolis police after the murder of George Floyd.
He encountered a raft of political problems in his first Senate term.
The Senate ethics committee investigated Fateh’s relationship to his convicted brother-in-law; his relationship with Somali TV, which ran low cost ads for him and for which he sought a $500,000 grant; and the fact that he ran his campaign out of a south Minneapolis adult day care center for free without reporting it on his campaign finance report. The committee — a deadlocked two Democrats and two Republicans — dismissed all the ethics complaint allegations except for failing to report a $1,000 Somali TV campaign ad expenditure and recommended campaign finance training.
Fateh uses leverage during trifecta
Democrats swept the 2022 elections and entered the 2023 session with a trifecta. The Minnesota Senate was narrowly divided, 34-33, with Democrats holding a one-seat majority. This gave each Democratic senator a de facto veto.
As much as any other senator, Fateh seemed to understand this leverage, and he used it.
Throughout the 2023 session, Fateh pushed for his Uber/Lyft legislation that guaranteed minimum pay rates and expanded protections for drivers. The proposal floundered toward the end of the session amid fierce lobbying from the ride-share companies. Uber said it would pull out of greater Minnesota and only provide “premium services” in the Twin Cities if the bill passed.
He successfully pressured legislative leaders to revive his bill, telling them in an email that he would “not be voting on any conference committee report (budget bills) on the floor until this passes on the floors of both the House and Senate,” Axios reported in August. In other words: No Uber/Lyft bill, no state budget. The legislative leaders acquiesced and his bill passed.

Sen. Jim Carlson, DFL-Eagan, said lawmakers threatening to withhold their votes unless their bills are passed is a common practice.
“It’s done all the time. We don’t admit it, but it’s done more often than you think,” said Carlson, who has endorsed Fateh for mayor. He praised Fateh’s work ethic and big heart.
Gov. Tim Walz vetoed the Uber/Lyft bill, instead creating a task force that included drivers, riders, the transportation network companies and lawmakers to make recommendations for legislation in the 2024 session.
Fateh was appointed to the task force, but he withdrew and never attended a meeting.
In 2024, Fateh was the champion for Uber and Lyft drivers at the Capitol again, and again Fateh used his leverage, but this time it led to a chaotic finish. They wound up throwing nearly their entire legislative agenda into a single, 1,400-page bill, in one of the more flagrant violations of the Minnesota Constitution’s single subject rule. A judge has already tossed out a gun control measure that was part of the massive bill. 
Regardless, a group of Uber/Lyft drivers hoisted Fateh on to their shoulders outside the Senate chamber, and the measure went into effect last year.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GOCL8P0WAAArwGh-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765
,California,2025-10-10 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s long-running saga over local tax measures might return to the ballot,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/local-tax-measures-return-ballot/,A recent appellate court ruling over a 2020 ballot measure in San Diego marks the latest front in California's ongoing saga over local tax initiatives. Tax gadflies vow to put a measure on the 2026 ballot.,"Last week, a state appellate court declared that a 2020 ballot measure to increase hotel taxes in San Diego is valid even though it did not receive the two-thirds approval that voters had been told it would require. The decision was the latest skirmish in a years-long political and legal wrangle over voting requirements for local tax increase proposals.
To begin at the beginning, in 1996, California voters approved Proposition 218 which, among other things, required two-thirds voter approval for local taxes designated for specific purposes. Proponents described it as an extension of Proposition 13, California’s iconic tax limit measure approved in 1978.
In 2017, the state Supreme Court hinted that while the two-thirds vote requirement applied to taxes proposed by local governments, it might not apply to those proposed by a citizens initiative, when enough signatures are collected.
Writing a 5-2 decision in a case called “Upland” because it dealt with a tax on marijuana sales in that city, Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar declared, “Multiple provisions of the state constitution explicitly constrain the power of local governments to raise taxes. But we will not lightly apply such restrictions on local governments to voter initiatives.”
Tax proponents took the hint and began placing tax measures on the ballot via initiative, but often wound up in court. While some local judges applied the supermajority standard, others declared that simple majority votes suffice.
In 2020, the Supreme Court — in a roundabout way — ended the confusion by refusing to consider an appellate ruling that validated special taxes proposed by initiative and approved by simple majorities.
Last year, the California Business Roundtable and other groups that disliked the Supreme Court’s partial dismantling of Prop. 218 fired back with a constitutional ballot measure that would reimpose supermajority votes for special taxes proposed via initiative and place very tight restrictions on the legislature’s power to raise taxes.
Once again, however, the Supreme Court interceded. It blocked the initiative, unanimously declaring that the Taxpayers Protection Act, as it was dubbed, would be a revision of the state constitution because of its restrictions on the legislature and therefore was itself unconstitutional.
“No speculation regarding potential future consequences is needed to conclude that the TPA is a revision on its face,” the court declared. “The measure would fundamentally restructure the most basic of governmental powers. The TPA would exclude the levying of new taxes from the Legislature’s control by requiring voter approval of all such measures.”
It’s against this background that the battle over hotel taxes in San Diego has been waged. Local leaders sought the increase largely to finance expansion of an already cavernous waterfront convention center in hopes of attracting more and larger conventions and trade shows.
When the issue was placed before local voters in 2020, they were told that it required a two-thirds vote. It received 65.2% of the vote and election officials declared it a loser, but the San Diego City Council nevertheless voted to say it passed.
Tax increase opponents sued, alleging that while the measure was placed on the ballot by initiative petition, it was a sham that concealed the role that officialdom played in the process. It resulted in last week’s appellate court ruling that the tax increase is valid.
Tax opponents may take the issue to the state Supreme Court, but their chances of winning seem slim. Meanwhile, however, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association is promoting a potential measure for the 2026 ballot that would reinstate the two-thirds vote for local special taxes, regardless of how they made the ballot.
“The Upland loophole has allowed special interest groups to write initiatives that raise taxes, direct the money to themselves, and pass them with just a simple majority,” the organization’s president Jon Coupal said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524-Election-Fresno_LV_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

“We must stand firmly in our beliefs between right and wrong, justice and forgiveness,” he wrote. “Alabama is steadfast in our commitment to holding the guilty accountable because that is what honors the dignity of every victim. Justice is how we restore peace to the communities they leave behind.”
The statement, issued immediately after Alabama’s execution by suffocation of Geoffrey West on Sept. 25, makes a mockery of terms and concepts that are spiritually central to the Indigenous practice of peacemaking: accountability, dignity, restoration, healing, and community well-being.

Will Berry and Geoffrey West wanted those things. West wanted to say he was sorry, every day of his life, for having killed Berry’s mother, Margaret Parrish Berry, when Berry was only 11 years old. Berry wanted to ask questions. They wanted to meet in person. They wanted to pray together.
I don’t want Alabama to execute my mother’s killer. I don’t want revenge in my name.

The Berrys learned about West’s execution date from a news story, not from the state. After it became clear that Berry opposed the execution, West’s attorneys asked me to join the defense team as a restorative justice specialist. Preparation, which typically unfolds over the course of a year, was compressed into two weeks.
I met with Berry to ask about his needs, boundaries, and aspirations within these constraints. I then met with West to develop a profile of his personal growth so that Berry could gain a sense of who he had become in the nearly three decades since his conviction. We crafted a letter of accountability to Berry that conveyed, with moral clarity, the harm he had caused. It also conveyed an understanding of the impacts his actions have had on Berry’s life.
“My mom is my best friend, and I know that’s what I took from you,” he wrote. “I can’t imagine how many times you have wanted to talk to your own mother and the pain that must have inflicted on you.”
Geoffrey Todd West (Alabama Department of Corrections)
He expressed his sincere remorse and described what has tried to do to transform himself since then, even from within the environment of deprivation and isolation on death row.
We waited as Berry’s pleas — for clemency; a reprieve, a restorative justice conference — were stonewalled by the governor’s office. In the end, the best we could do was comfort a bewildered and outraged Berry as the state did the very thing he told them would worsen his trauma and grief.
The political landscape in Alabama equates justice with punishment, but a 2023 survey of Alabamians who had lost loved ones to homicide found that only a third reported feeling better after the person who killed their loved one was incarcerated. Like Berry, more than a quarter of respondents wanted to talk with that person. They also wanted direct support: counseling, assistance with the financial burdens that come with the sudden death of a close relative, and help navigating administrative bureaucracies in the wake of their grief.
​Berry’s requests echoed those of Toni and Terryln Hall who, in 2022, implored the governor to spare Joe Nathan James, Jr., the man who killed their mother, or at least allow them to meet him face to face. Berry made the same request to the governor’s constituent services representative: “It’s enough death. We don’t want no more mourning, my family or his family. I want a relationship with this man but it can’t happen if he dies. It can’t. I think it’s wrong that y’all, the state of Alabama, will let me see the man die but won’t let me visit him, hug his neck, tell him I love him and forgive him to his face.”
These needs also map onto the very restorative justice principles travestied by the attorney general’s statement. Restorative justice is predicated on what Howard Zehr called the 3 R’s: Respect, Responsibility, and Relationships. It insists on a survivor-centered system in which those directly impacted by violence are given the respect of having their voices heard and their needs understood. It also insists on the inherent dignity of those who cause harm and requires communities to support them in accepting accountability, understanding the root causes of their actions, and taking concrete steps toward transformation and repair.
Restorative processes maximize accountability by creating opportunities for those who have harmed and been harmed to dialogue with one another about the causes and impacts of violence. Above all, restorative justice emphasizes the power of relationships, understanding harm to be a breach in community trust that requires active participation from impacted parties and adjacent community members in order to restore peace.
Had the state of Alabama listened to Berry’s needs, the process could have unfolded in the time it required. I might have been able to work with each party to establish trust, create guidelines for engagement, and establish a space that is safe for expressing difficult feelings: shame, remorse, abandonment, anger, grief, and pain.
Berry might have had the time he needed to seek the additional support necessary for the trauma he was still experiencing. Both parties could have emotionally prepared themselves for a meeting that, while challenging, would have also provided opportunities for understanding and healing. The process itself would have been an important step toward transforming cultures of violence that are perpetuated, not adjudicated, by the death penalty.
Instead, Berry sat at home and waited for news that the man he wanted so much to meet was dead. He did not believe, as the attorney general’s office insisted, that West’s execution honored his dignity, nor did it honor that of his mother. “She would not have wanted this,” he insisted.
Now Will Berry, having lost his own mother, worries for the mother of Geoffrey West.
The state should no longer claim to speak on behalf of survivors if it only acknowledges pain that can be harnessed for vengeance. It does not know what to do with survivors like Will Berry who insist on restorative justice.

Musk’s fleet of 102 Teslas can now transport passengers between tunnels and any of the 104 proposed stations along its planned route, as well as to and from Harry Reid International Airport.
Every above-ground trip “must include the tunnel transportation system,” Tyler Fairbanks of the Boring Company told NTA commissioners. 
For instance, a passenger in a tunneled Tesla that reaches the end of a tunnel can continue the ride on surface streets for an additional price, and as long as their destination is one of the stops on Boring’s planned network of stations. Only a handful of stations are currently in operation. 
Taxi company executives, as well as taxi drivers, complained the Boring subsidiary Paradise Transportation’s per capita charges would undercut taxi fares.
“We have approximately 50% of the market here in Vegas,” Michael Bailin, general manager of Taxi Management, the largest operator in Nevada, told the NTA, adding the company’s 2,400 employees and independent contractors would be challenged to make a living competing with Musk’s venture.  
Paradise sought to charge $7 for trips up to three miles, $12 for four to six miles, and $14 for trips of more than six miles. 
“Vegas is struggling,” Bailin said. “We all know it. And to add something else that’s not needed, it doesn’t seem like the time or place.”
Bailin added Musk knew his plan to ease traffic congestion “wasn’t going to happen overnight,” adding now they want to come up from the tunnels “to stay afloat.” 
“This is a tough thing for people to swallow, because you came in under the guise of one thing, of being in the tunnels, and now you’re saying ‘we’re not going to be in the tunnels,’” NTA chairman Vaughn Hartung told the Boring Company representatives. Hartung voiced his “discomfort with approving a blanket approval knowing that the tunnels are coming,” noting “they’re not just going from the tunnel to the airport or from the airport to the tunnel.” 
Hartung proposed that Boring commit to completing 20% of its project each year, with a goal of tunneling the remaining 58 miles in five years. Boring has so far dug ten miles of tunnels.
Fairbanks, of Boring Company, said the uncertain timetable of obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies made such a commitment untenable. “We hope it expands beyond the 68 miles we’re entitled to build,” he added.  
NTA staff supported approval of the application, and noted they received  verification of market necessity for the surface street version of the Vegas Loop from Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority Chief Strategy Officer Ed Finger. 
The LVCVA, “the busiest convention center in America, the owner of the Las Vegas Monorail and the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop, strongly supports and encourages transportation options in the Strip resort corridor,” Finger said during public comment. “The Strip resort corridor is a long way away from being optimized transportation-wise.” 
Finger offered no tangible evidence of a need for more automobile transit in the tourism corridor.  
Steve Hill, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, has hailed going underground as a means of alleviating traffic congestion since 2019, when the LVCVA granted Musk’s Boring Company a $52.5 million contract to connect its expanding convention facility via tunnels. Hill also planted the seeds for expanding the labyrinth to run beneath Strip and downtown casinos, with Musk footing the bill and collecting the revenue.
Musk’s Tesla Corporation is reaping the benefits of more than $1.6 billion in tax breaks. Hill shepherded the initial portion of that deal in his former job as executive director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 
The NTA unanimously approved a motion that called for Boring, although it was not the applicant, to “make best efforts to complete the tunnels,” limit above-ground travel to no more than four miles per trip, and come back for a status check in two years.
The NTA also required that Paradise, which requested unlimited ability to add to its fleet, come before the commission for permission to do so.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/newvloc.webp,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

The venture accounted for more than two-thirds of the gold mined in Nevada in 2024. (Barrick Mining Corp. press release photo)For the first time ever the price of an ounce of gold went above $4,000 this week. The price has shot up by 50% since the start of the year. 
Bitcoin’s a cyberslacker by comparison. It’s only gone up 30% year-to-date.
Gold’s skyrocketing price has even outpaced the ballooning (some say bubbling) price of Nvidia stock, up 43% so far in 2025.
Earlier this week Goldman Sachs predicted gold’s run of good fortune will continue, projecting the price will be pushing $5,000 by the end of next year.
Given its frantic pace — it was only six months ago that gold hit $3,000 for the first time — it wouldn’t be entirely shocking if gold hit $5,000 by the end of this year.
Then again, gold momentarily slipped back under $4,000 Thursday, and it also wouldn’t be shocking if the price eventually settled in somewhere between $3,000 and $4,000 for the next, oh, several years. In January of 2014, gold was $1,269 an ounce. Five years of more or less slogging along later, in January of 2019, the price had shot all the way up to… $1,286.  Gold can be a volatile asset. It can also be a sleepy one.
Gold’s surge was initially sparked by broad and deep uncertainty and anxiety created by Donald Trump’s insistence on confusing his feelings for sound economic and fiscal policy. When things get weird, the price of gold shoots up.
Las Vegas agonizes while gold soars. That’s not just a fluke.

There currently being no indication things will stop being weird any time soon, Goldman’s $5,000 projection may indeed be an underestimate.
In any case, a loose pattern, in the current century anyway, is that when gold does spike, even after it retreats, a new, higher floor price has been established going forward. 
And even if the price did fall all the way back to $3,000 by the end of this year, it would still mark one of the best years ever for the corporations that mine gold in Nevada.
So what?
If Nevada were a country (amusing thought), it would be the world’s fifth largest producer of gold, after China, Russia, Australia, and Canada.
But while Nevada’s economy sure could use a break, it won’t get much if any of one from gold’s momentous price surge.
In 2024, $9 billion worth of gold was mined in Nevada. That’s equivalent to a respectable 3.5% of Nevada’s gross domestic product. 
Yet as of August, the Nevada industry employed less than 11,000 people, about seven-tenths of 1% of the state’s workforce. 
As mining in Nevada and everywhere has become more mechanized and automated, more minerals are produced with fewer employees. Despite increased production and new and expanding mines, the number of people employed in Nevada’s mining industry now is a couple hundred fewer than it was ten years ago.
If Barrick Mining Corp. and Newmont Corp., who together form the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture that accounts for more than two-thirds of the gold mined in the state, were to mine even more gold to take advantage of higher prices, that would likely entail the creation of relatively few additional jobs. This year’s stunning price increases notwithstanding, there were fewer people working in Nevada mines in August of this year than there were in August 2024.
The industry’s contribution to the state’s public services, programs, and infrastructure is similarly undersized relative to its revenue. 
Nevada has two mining-specific taxes — the net proceeds on minerals tax, and the gold and silver excise tax — which combined to generate almost $205 million in tax revenue last year. 
That sounds like a lot. But it’s merely about 2% of the value of gold mined in Nevada in 2024, an affectionately light tax burden. 
Nevada’s politicians, regardless of party, have further coddled the industry by coupling irresponsibly small mining tax rates with recklessly generous tax deductions. 
Thanks to the deductions, each year several gold mines pay no mining net proceeds tax at all. Last year gold production was reported at 25 mines in Nevada. Eleven of them, most but not all of them smaller mines, collectively produced $623.6 million worth of gold while paying zero under the state’s primary mining tax, the one on “net proceeds of minerals,” according to the 2024 Net Proceeds of Minerals Bulletin published by the Nevada Department of Taxation. 
Gold’s skyrocketing price almost certainly means Nevada’s mining tax revenue will be bigger this year than it was last year (though never underestimate the industry’s artistry at maximizing the aforementioned tax deductions). 
And yet even if Nevada mining tax revenue were to echo the price of gold and rise by more than 50%, it would still be almost negligible relative to the state’s overall tax revenue. For example, that $205 million in mining taxes the industry paid in 2024 is a mere one-ninth the $1.8 billion in state revenue generated by sales taxes when Nevadans buy a car, shoes, or a sandwich for lunch.
Senator assures industry Nevada will remain a mining colony

And unlike coal, oil, and natural gas, the federal government doesn’t tax the value of gold production at all. Like the late Sen. Harry Reid before her, Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto has proudly protected the industry from having to pay federal mineral royalties. 
Substantial portions of federal mineral royalties paid on coal, oil, and natural gas are returned to the states where the mineral is produced, and hence a windfall for those states’ services and programs. So while no one can say Cortez Masto shies away from protecting the industry, her commitment to protecting her constituents’ best interest is less obvious.
Colonialism’s staying power
As investments go, gold can be pretty lame. It doesn’t earn any interest, like a bond or even a money market account. It doesn’t pay dividends, like equities. There have been those occasional stretches when its value just doesn’t move much at all for years.
And as an industry, gold’s moment in the spotlight can be pretty inconsequential to the very jurisdictions where it operates. 
The industry is crucial to people in local communities in Nevada and the four countries that produce even more gold than Nevada does — people without whom the industry’s magnificent financial performance this year would not have been possible.
But the industry would have carried on more or less as it has this year even without its run of excellent fortune. For Nevada’s people and economy, gold’s amazing price spike is essentially a nothingburger. 
The Nevada gold mining industry remains a stubborn vestige of economic imperialism, it’s primary mission being to extract resources from its Nevada colony to enrich shareholders elsewhere.
And that’s going great. The price of gold may be up 53% so far in 2025. But as of Friday morning, year-to-date the price of Barrick and Newmont shares were up 114% and 132%, respectively.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10_gold_1600-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243

The arrests of the workers at El Potro Mexican Café in February were among the first in the Kansas City area to draw widespread media attention.
The Liberty cases became part of a broader filing, challenging government tactics under the second Trump administration on behalf of 26 immigrant plaintiffs.
The case did not question the government’s right to make arrests on immigration violations. But it questioned whether it had violated the prior consent agreement by making warrantless arrests.
On Oct. 7, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, ruled in favor of the immigrant workers.
Judge Jeffrey I. Cummings ordered U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to lift any conditions on the release of 22 immigrants, including 11 people who had been detained after the Liberty raid.
The other 11 people were detained in Chicago through warrantless arrests in their neighborhood or vehicles, according to the National Immigrant Justice Center, which helped bring the case.
The decision has far-reaching implications and is a huge win for due process, said Rekha Sharma-Crawford, a Kansas City-based immigration attorney representing the Liberty workers.
The Liberty restaurant workers now are out on bond, an option that has become nearly impossible in recent months for detainees taken into ICE custody.
“Their deportation cases, at least for the time being, would have to be dismissed because they were all arrested unlawfully,” Sharma-Crawford said.
In addition to Missouri and Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Kentucky are also under the consent decree, known for the name of one of the original plaintiffs, Margarito Castañon Nava.
Cummings also ordered the Department of Homeland Security to reissue its warrantless arrest policy nationwide and certify that any officers who violated the consent decree were retrained.
Also, ICE will need to report to the court the names and arrest documents for anyone else who had been arrested without a warrant on immigration violations since June in the Northern District of Illinois, and to continue making similar reports monthly.
In some of the cases, federal officials were accused of creating warrants after they had already arrested the individuals on the civil violations of being without lawful immigration or citizenship status.
Cummings also extended the consent decree to Feb. 2, 2026.
It had been set to expire May 12, 2025, had further violations not been found.
The date change “corresponds to the number of days between the date that ICE unequivocally ceased its compliance with the Agreement (June 11, 2025) and the date of this Memorandum Opinion and Order to provide plaintiffs with the full three-year term of the Agreement for which they bargained,” according to the judge’s ruling.
The Department of Homeland Security also was ordered to pay the plaintiffs’ attorney fees.
The case was brought by the National Immigrant Justice Center and the Roger Baldwin Foundation of the ACLU of Illinois.
“Today’s decision makes clear that DHS and ICE — like everyone else — must follow the Constitution and the law,” said ACLU of Illinois Deputy Legal Director Michelle Garcia, co-counsel, in a statement.
“The federal government’s reckless practice of stopping, harassing and detaining people — and then finding a justification for the action must end,” Garcia said. “The Trump administration’s destructive mass deportation scheme is not a reason to toss aside bedrock constitutional principles, disregard federal law or court orders.”
The ruling comes as the federal government ramps up the presence of immigration agents in Chicago, and President Donald Trump is threatening to send in the National Guard to maintain order in the face of protests in Portland.
The Department of Homeland Security has not issued a statement yet on the court’s decision.
The Liberty workers were detained after more than a dozen agents with Homeland Security Investigations entered the restaurant looking for a worker suspected of a child sex crime.
But communication problems, possibly exacerbated by language barriers, led to the federal agents entering a private office space, despite the lack of a warrant, and collecting employment documents.
Twelve workers were handcuffed and detained. One of the immigrants was later removed from the U.S.
The judgment is being noted by local immigrant rights advocates as an example of strategic legal filings designed to force the government to stay within the law.
More than 3,000 people in the Kansas City area have been trained in know-your-rights sessions by Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, or AIRR.
During the training, an emphasis is placed on witnesses filming federal agents during a raid to document that policies and the law are being followed, rather than focusing on the immigrants.
AIRR also stresses that witnesses refrain from name-calling of federal agents, as such video might be necessary to submit in cases like the one just decided in the Illinois court.

Phil Murphy signed the state's ban on single-use plastic bags and straws in 2020. Critics say it is inconvenient and makes grocery trips more expensive. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Gubernatorial hopeful Jack Ciattarelli gets a warm reception from prospective voters when he promises to lower property taxes and fix NJ Transit. 
But the Republican hoping to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy admits there’s one topic that “brings down the house every single time” — his pledge to rescind the state’s plastic bag ban. 
“Here’s the best part of my energy master plan, you ready? At the supermarket, you’re getting back your plastic bags,” Ciattarelli said at an event in Nutley Monday, prompting a resounding ovation from the crowd. 
NJ governor hopefuls want phones out of classrooms — in different ways

Though many of Ciattarelli’s campaign trail promises are echoed by Democratic opponent Mikie Sherrill — they both say they want to make the state more affordable and tackle rising energy costs — the plastic bag ban appears to be exclusively a fixation of the Republican candidate.
Asked Wednesday whether she has a position on retaining or reversing the ban, Sherrill told reporters, “I think we shouldn’t be using plastic bags.” 
Ciattarelli posted a video of that exchange on social media with the caption, “Based on this answer, I’m not sure Mikie Sherrill knows about the plastic bag ban in NJ — but one thing is clear: if you want your bags back at the grocery store, don’t vote for Mikie.”
Murphy, a Democrat, signed the plastic bag ban in 2020 as part of an effort to reduce waste. Since the law went into effect in 2022, grocery stores, restaurants, and other businesses have largely been barred from handing out single-use plastic bags and paper bags.
New Jersey is one of 12 states that restrict the use of single-use plastic bags, including California, New York, and Vermont, according to the National Wildlife Federation, while other states like Montana and Wisconsin have laws that bar jurisdictions from enacting such bans.
Unlike some other states, New Jersey offers no option for shoppers to pay for a plastic bag. Instead, they must rely on reusable bags they bring themselves or purchase from the retailer. Critics have complained that too many extra bags have piled up in their homes.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat who challenged Sherrill for the Dem nod for governor this spring, had pledged to bring back plastic bags if elected, saying the ban raises costs for everyday New Jerseyans by making their grocery bills more expensive.
Sen. Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex) sponsored the plastic bag ban when it was introduced in 2018. There’s been opposition, but complaints have dropped since the ban went into effect, and people adapted their routines by toting around reusable bags in their cars, Greenstein said in an interview. 
She stressed the environmental benefits of the law, like fewer plastic bags washing up on the shore or caught in trees. 
“It helps our environment and it’s really not inconveniencing people that much,” she said. “Some people just want to complain about everything, so they will, but I just sense in the supermarket, people are used to it and it doesn’t seem to bother anybody.”
And while she recommends the next governor tackle other priorities when they come into office in January, Greenstein is not surprised that Ciattarelli’s crowds support bringing back plastic bags. 
“It’s the MAGA thing to not want to be told what to do, so if it’s his crowd, they’re going to give him rousing applause because they want to be told they can do whatever they want to do, but as to whether it’s a true inconvenience to them, I’m going to guess it really isn’t,” she said. 
A 2024 report from nonprofits Environment America, U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, and Frontier Group found that bans in three states, including New Jersey, and two cities have reduced the number of single-use plastic bags used annually by around 6 billion.

The lesson is clear: refugee integration is not only about jobs or English — it is about the community resilience that makes them possible.

Dr. Bose is a migration scholar and urban geographer; he is a professor of geography and geosciences, and he is the co-director of Global Studies at the University of Vermont. Dr. Huddleston is an international migration researcher and educator, and he serves as the University Partnerships Coordinator with the Ethiopian Community Development Council (ECDC) Multicultural Community Center of Southern Vermont. 


Vermont is quietly teaching the rest of America how even small rural communities can welcome refugees.
The University of Vermont and Ethiopian Community Development Council (ECDC) Multicultural Community Center, along with other local partners, just published the key findings from our Vermont Leahy Rural Resettlement Impact Initiative in Brattleboro and Bennington, two of the very few rural counties in the U.S. engaged in rural resettlement. The 500+ resettled refugees from Afghanistan, DRC Congo, Eritrea and elsewhere are successfully developing new lives, friendships and a strong sense of belonging to Vermont.
Our research is complemented by the latest Vermonter Poll by the University of Vermont, which shows that most Vermonters want to continue to welcome refugees. With decreasing federal support for refugees and immigrants, Vermonters agree that the state, non-profits and communities will have to take on more responsibilities and they see and see employment and language learning as the keys to refugees’ success in the state.  
Yet our interviews with southern Vermont’s new refugee communities tell a more nuanced story. While employment and language learning are also top priorities for the refugees we interviewed, refugees’ successes and challenges in these areas are tightly linked with “hidden barriers” that are less visible to the public.
Transportation is particularly urgent. Families often remain dependent on friends and volunteers for rides. Learning how to drive, purchase and maintain a car can open major opportunities in rural Vermont, especially for refugee women. Equally important are multilingual staff and refugee-led community spaces and services, which provide essential support for stay-at-home mothers and the elderly. 
Affordable childcare is another hidden barrier — without it, mothers in particular struggle to attend ESL classes or hold down jobs. Stable housing and healthcare access are also closely linked to progress in employment and English classes. 
Vocational training and higher education are also critical: many refugees arrive highly motivated but underemployed, especially refugee women. Over 50% of refugees in southern Vermont arrive with little to no English, and one-third without a high school education. Still, interest in English, career development, and higher education is high.
To address these challenges, Southern Vermont’s community-based organizations have been essential but stretched thin with federal funding cuts. Our research found that volunteers and refugee communities provide critical help, but they cannot fully meet the need on their own. Community partners worry that without additional funding and multilingual staff, most of Southern Vermont’s refugees will be left on their own.
The lesson is clear: refugee integration is not only about jobs or English — it is about the community resilience that makes them possible. The successes of Vermont’s rural refugee resettlement model offers hope that small towns can make refugees feel welcome.
To sustain success, we must invest in the practical supports that refugees themselves identify as essential: refugee-led services and spaces, drivers’ education, career pathways, affordable housing and childcare. The key, our research shows, is listening to refugees themselves and building up their skills and partnerships as new community leaders. As one Congolese refugee in Brattleboro put it, “Yeah, I’m a refugee, but I feel like there’s something Brattleboro can do to change that. Addressing these people like new Vermonters would be much better than addressing them like refugees.”
If Vermont listens to and resources refugee leaders and community partners, it can continue to lead.

(Illustration by Jonathan Rico/WVUE)Louisiana officials have canceled another major coastal restoration project — the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion on the east bank of Plaquemines Parish. 
Gordon Dove, chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, confirmed to WVUE-TV Fox 8 Wednesday that the state will not continue the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion. The project would have channeled fresh water and sediment from the Mississippi River near Wills Point to the dying coastal marshes of Breton Sound. 
It is the second major coastal restoration project Gov. Jeff Landry has shut down. He scrapped the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project in May even though $3 billion from the Deepwater Horizon settlement was available to complete the project and $560 million had already been spent. Construction hadn’t yet begun on the Mid-Breton project. 
Both projects served as key initiatives in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan, which has been in place for nearly two decades. Although the state is currently operating other river diversions, they are smaller in scope and designed only to prevent saltwater intrusion — not restore land. 
Landry’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon. He previously criticized the Mid-Barataria project for its rising costs and potential harm to oyster fisheries in that area.
Dove told WVUE the cost of Mid-Breton had ballooned from several hundred million dollars to an estimated $1.8 billion. The state has over $8 billion set aside for coastal restoration projects. The money came from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement.
$2 billion approved for Louisiana coastal work, despite paused major project

Coastal marshland serves as a natural storm barrier against hurricanes and soaks up rain and flood waters. It also creates habitat for fish and wildlife and absorbs air pollution. 
Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of coast since 1932, according to the 2023 Coastal Master Plan. Scientists say the marsh is dying because it stopped receiving the nutrient-rich fresh water and sediment once levees were built to control flooding along the Mississippi River. Rising sea levels brought about by climate change have made the situation worse, the plan stated.    
Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, criticized the state’s decision in a news release Thursday, saying it goes against accepted science and the interests of Louisiana residents. 
Cancelling the project could also place other coastal restoration efforts in jeopardy. Restore spokesman Charles Sutcliffe pointed out that other initiatives in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan, such as marsh building projects, rely on the sediment diversions for their long-term sustainability. 
Dredging and marsh creation projects left in the plan are going to sink and erode without a consistent source of fresh water and sediment, Sutcliffe added. He questioned the point of having a Coastal Master Plan that many stakeholders agreed on if one person can decide “behind closed doors” to cancel its biggest projects at any time.
The state’s Coastal Master Plan represents years of bipartisan work and investments from government officials, scientists, business owners, residents and engineers. The Mid-Breton project was added to the plan in 2007. 
“This cancellation disregards the decades of transparency and significant effort that went into research, permitting, community engagement and modeling for the project,” Restore said in a news release. “ … Canceling this project puts integral large-scale, sustainable coastal restoration years, or even decades, further out of reach.”

These panels so rarely result in advancing policy discussions that they are simply unnecessary. And yet the state continues to spend money on them year after year. The average cost the last four years is about $100,000 annually though it has come down recently.
The spending is largely in increased per diem and mileage paid to lawmakers to attend the meetings, though there are some staff expenses as well.
I love the theory behind study committees — that sometimes the best law is not made in the heat of a fast-moving legislative session. Instead, there are complex topics that deserve a more thorough vetting.
So, legislative leaders every year pick issues that need to be studied more intensely during the summer and fall months. This year, 12 committees were assigned topics ranging from how to help Hoosiers with medical debt to barriers for licensed professions and the economic value of public recreational land.
Usually, the committees are made up only of legislators, but a few panels also have members with specialized expertise.
One good thing about the committees is that a lot of really good information is presented to them and many studies, analyses and documents are made available to the public. But that’s where the usefulness ends.
Many of the committees meet only once, though a few get in two meetings. I would say, generally, we are talking about a few hours of discussion on some pretty significant issues. And then a final report is adopted with little fanfare. And what’s in those reports?

Not much.
It’s usually a recitation of how many meetings were held and who spoke at them. And then there is the recommendation section. Here is a sample from a few committees this year that have already adopted their reports.
The Interim Study Committee on Courts and the Judiciary heard some fascinating proposals in terms of medical debt but didn’t come up with a single recommendation.
“Chair (Liz) Brown reviewed the topics considered by the Committee during the interim, as outlined in the draft final report. The Committee will not make recommendations regarding medical debt, the INjail Public Portal, or the proposal to allocate judicial resources. The Committee approved the final report by a vote of 14-0,” the minutes read.
Similarly, the Interim Study Committee on Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications reviewed annual reports of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and “issued no findings or recommendations.”
Sometimes the panels don’t want to wade into specifics of legislation so as not to pin lawmakers down on hot topics too early. But more often it’s that there just isn’t time in one or two meetings to do any work of depth.
I want to give some credit to the Interim Study Committee on Agriculture and Natural Resources, which met twice and adopted 13 recommendations. They included reintroducing bills from the 2025 session that didn’t quite make it to the finish line. Other suggestions were more aspirational, such as additional funding for building and maintenance at state parks, establishing a dedicated source of conservation funding and implementing a system to collect visitor fees at state fish and wildlife areas.
Occasionally, there are some interim committees that make real progress. But they are the aberration, not the norm. And it’s time — when state employees are losing jobs, child care programs are being cut and other funding is eliminated — for lawmakers to either do away with them altogether or strengthen them in a way that allows for thoughtful and realistic recommendations for specific legislation.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)An often-outdated pharmacy law test is “absolutely” making Indiana lose would-be pharmacists —  and it shouldn’t be a licensing requirement, medical professionals told lawmakers Thursday.
“It can lead to confusion when pharmacists are trying to study for this exam in our state: do I look at the old laws or the new laws? Do you want your pharmacist to know the current law in the state, or what was law five years ago?” asked Veronica Vernon, a Butler University pharmacy professor.
Hoosier license applicants must pass a general practice knowledge exam — the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination — and a pharmacy law test: the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination.
Both are by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, but Indiana’s Board of Pharmacy writes state-specific questions for the second. That’s the one Vernon and others want to scrap.
The witnesses spoke before an interim study committee focused on licensing barriers.
“Is the pass-fail rate on this causing us to lose pharmacists?” Rep. Mark Genda, R-Frankfort, asked.
“Absolutely, it is,” Vernon replied. “It’s out of date; it depends on what questions get asked.”
The testimony came at a meeting of the Interim Study Committee on Commerce and Economic Development.
Sarah Trovinger, a pharmacist representing the Indiana Pharmacy Association, said the test’s questions also disadvantage pharmacists working in hospitals and other, less common settings.

“‘How many square feet does a community pharmacy have to be?’ … Those are things that you’re not even going to come in contact with while you’re there,” she said.
Trovinger explained that pharmacists are working in hospitals through nationally accredited residency programs, which require participants to be licensed for at least part of the program.
“If they don’t pass it the first time, then they get kicked out of that residency program,” she said.
Genda commented that it seems like the state’s Board of Pharmacy “is asleep” and “not doing their job” by appropriately selecting and updating the questions.
“Our Board of Pharmacy is great,” Trovinger said. “… Their main job is to make sure that our patients are safe and that our pharmacists … are doing the things they want to do. This should not be where they’re having to spend their time and energy every year because we teach pharmacy law.”
Some lawmakers were openly skeptical.
“You don’t think that there should be that initial (check) of, ‘Do you understand the law of Indiana to practice here?'” Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne, asked Vernon. “Or … should that just be the approach here, is to make sure the exam is up to date, versus totally eliminating anything to do with understanding the law before you start?”
“I think we need to eliminate the law exam, and it’s because we teach it in our schools,” she said.
Vernon also argued that many other health care professionals that can write and dispense prescriptions, like physicians or nurses, don’t have have to take a law exam.
Dr. Amanda Wright, a family medicine professor at Marian University, said parity is important.
“I bet you don’t hear that a lot, physicians saying, ‘I’m here for the the pharmacists and (physician assistants), but that’s what we’re going to have to do to get our Hoosiers cared for,” Wright added.
Physician assistant rules
Jason Kolkmeier, a physician assistant representing the Indiana Association of Physician Assistants, asked lawmakers to join an interstate compact to make it easier for licensees to work across state lines. He also requested updates to “antiquated” PA laws.
“We’re the only provider in the state of Indiana that has a ratio limit,” he said. This means that only a certain number of PA’s can be assigned to one doctor.
Collaborative practice agreements are another barrier, per Kolkmeier.
“Every task that we are allowed to do has to be delegated and written out on that collaborative practice agreement. As you can see, that’s burdensome for (the) administrative side,” he said.
If some authority isn’t listed, he has to reschedule care or refer patients to another provider. If a new drug isn’t on there, it can’t be prescribed until the agreement is updated.
And, PAs are tied to one doctor.
“If that physician were to unfortunately die tonight in car accident, I could not practice and provide care for my patients tomorrow,” Kolkmeier said. “So, we want to make arrangements where we’re allowed to practice to the top of our license and our education, so that Hoosiers have access to the care, whether that’s being tied to a facility or something like that.”
Eliminate PLA?
Lawmakers also expressed appetite for ditching the Professional Licensing Agency, an umbrella body overseeing 33 profession-specific licensing entities — like the Board of Pharmacy.
“Not to sound conspiracy theorist or accusatory in any way, (and) please don’t take my questions as an indictment of the current administration’s practices or even the previous one,” said Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville. “… It looks like we collect $10 million in license fees to spend $10 million on budget to do things that 104 (PLA employees) don’t have the qualifications to do, and the boards that have been appointed do have those qualifications. It seems duplicative to me.”
PLA representatives said board members — who work day jobs in their fields and mostly meet to make disciplinary decisions — don’t have the time or administrative expertise.
“If we had an extra $16 million … and we disseminated that out to these boards, would that be enough to (cover) the administrative needs to do this without a Professional Licensing Agency? I know that’s an extreme statement,” Baldwin said. 
Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis, asked if the Legislative Services Agency could get information — the number of employees dedicated to licensure, their statistics, and so on — from each agency that handles its own licensing. That data could be compared against PLA’s numbers.
The committee’s chair, Sen. Brian Buchanan, R-Lebanon, said he’d work with LSA staff on that.
The group has one more meeting before wrapping up its work.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)LAKE NORDEN — The names on the list included some of Dorothy Elliott’s best employees: hardworking, reliable, honest.
Most had been working at Drumgoon Dairy for years. Some worked there for nearly two decades, playing a role in the operation’s expansion and success.
But after an audit of the dairy at the end of May by the federal Department of Homeland Security, 38 of those employees are gone.
The department said they each had inaccurate, outdated or incomplete proof of U.S. citizenship or permission to work in the country.

Elliott co-owns the farm near Lake Norden, 5 miles from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s eastern South Dakota home. Elliott asked the affected employees for updated documentation but ultimately had to fire those who weren’t able to adequately resolve the problems with their documents. One person returned home because his visa was expiring, and another quit.
The audit decimated Elliott’s workforce, once more than 50 employees, dropping it to just 16.
Audits at dairy farms under the Trump administration’s escalated immigration enforcement efforts have “created unrest” among workers and owners, Elliott said. It’s made for a tough summer in an industry that was flourishing after decades of support from state government.
Elliott’s remaining employees have been working without breaks, she said. Without a pathway or plan to create a sustainable workforce in agriculture and by “removing everyone working in it,” she worries some agricultural operations will go out of business. She hopes Drumgoon isn’t one of them.
“Basically, we’ve turned off the tap, but we’ve done nothing to create a solution as to how we find employees for the dairy industry,” she said.
Never previously audited
Elliott is required to file I-9 forms with documentation proving her workers’ identity and eligibility to work in the U.S. It puts employers in a difficult position, said Scott VanderWal, president of the South Dakota Farm Bureau, because applicants may present fraudulent documents an employer doesn’t catch. Yet employers could also be sued for mistakenly rejecting valid documents.
“If employers are presented with documentation that looks real and legitimate, they’re obligated to accept it,” VanderWal said. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services offers similar guidance, saying employers must accept documentation if it “reasonably appears to be genuine.”
Elliott could use the federal government’s web-based system, E-Verify, that allows employers to confirm their employees’ eligibility to work in the country. But E-Verify is not mandated for new hires in South Dakota, and Elliott said she doesn’t use it because of “unreliable results.” Organizations ranging from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute to the American Civil Liberties Union have opposed the use of E-Verify, citing reasons including errors that cost people jobs because the system wrongly flagged them. 
So Elliott evaluates applicants’ documents herself. If their IDs are out of date or if they have a visa and are applying from another farm without returning home, she passes on hiring them. She’s turned people away a dozen times over the years, she said.
Lack of action on immigration is ‘holding SD back,’ dairy farmers say

Drumgoon was never audited before. In her past dealings with the Department of Homeland Security during nearly two decades of running the dairy, Elliott said, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would merely tell her they were searching for a person and ask for a notification if the person applied for a job. 
This time was different. After an audit, employers are required to terminate unauthorized workers who can’t prove their employability, according to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. Audits — which are distinct from raids or other immigration enforcement operations — are meant to ensure businesses comply with federal employment laws. 
Elliott does not know where her 38 former employees went. They could be working at other dairies in the U.S. They could have left the country. They could be anywhere.
Because the dairy is near a farm owned by Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, and because Noem was in the state during the month of the audit to receive an honorary degree, South Dakota Searchlight asked the Department of Homeland Security if Noem had a direct role in the audit. The department didn’t respond to the question. 
Elliott declined to talk about Noem, saying she recognizes that federal immigration authorities “have a job to do.” 
South Dakota Farmers Union President Doug Sombke called federal dairy audits “stupid,” because they needlessly displace workers. 
“Why the heck can’t we continue to use them there as an intern or apprentice or whatever you want to call it and make it legal? Why is it so important we grab them and call them a criminal? No one wants those jobs,” Sombke said. “I don’t understand why you’d cripple or cause problems for a labor shortage when all you have to do is get them legalized.”
Immigrants hiring immigrants
Elliott’s connection to immigrants isn’t limited to her employees. She was born in the United States but married her husband, Rodney, in Northern Ireland, where they had their children. 
Eliott worked in health care and her husband operated their 140-cow dairy farm in Northern Ireland when a newspaper ad, “Wanted: Dairy farmers in South Dakota,” caught their attention. Moving to America meant fewer regulations, cheaper land, cheaper feed and the ability to grow their business, she said.

The couple used the EB-5 investment-for-visa program to secure backers for their operation, opened the dairy in 2006, paid off the investors within a few years and have been expanding ever since. They started with about 1,500 cows in 2006 and have grown to 6,500.
Elliott’s children got their citizenship shortly after moving to the U.S., and her husband became a citizen about eight years after they moved. That experience helps her empathize with her workers, many of whom are Hispanic. She said everything they’re doing is to support their families back home, even though many aren’t able to see their families for years at a time.
“All they’re guilty of is working and doing a job that isn’t currently being filled by an American,” Elliott said.
Taneeza Islam advocates for immigrants as executive director of South Dakota Voices for Peace. She’s spoken to immigrant workers in other industries who were scared and confused after being terminated due to stricter immigration enforcement. 
“We have two very separate worlds right now: the community that’s impacted and worried about getting detained and deported, and the community that doesn’t know this is happening here,” Islam said.
State recruited dairies
The Elliotts are among many new South Dakotans who’ve helped the dairy industry boom in the last two decades. Then-governor and now-U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican, focused on supporting the industry in the early 2000s, which included efforts to recruit farmers from overseas.
In 2010, South Dakota’s dairy industry had an economic impact of $1.27 billion. By 2023, that had grown to $5.67 billion.
“We’ve achieved our goals we set out for ourselves: build a dairy, milk cows and grow the dairy industry in South Dakota,” Elliott said. “Is it a sustainable goal if there’s nobody to work on these dairies? No. So all the time, money, effort, investment and hard work that has gone into it will be null and void if there isn’t a workforce.”

Sombke, the state Farmers Union president, said the state’s investment in dairy “has been a good thing,” but he isn’t surprised by the recent disruption in the industry.
South Dakota Searchlight requested the number of audits conducted in South Dakota so far in 2025, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the department “does not disclose specific data on audits or enforcement actions by state or industry.” 
Sombke said dairy audits are “way up” in the state compared to last year. He said nobody should be surprised to find workers at dairies without permission to be in the country. 
“What do you expect? The unemployment rate is less than 2% in the state,” Sombke said. “You’re going to be looking for labor anywhere you can find it.”
Aftermath of an audit
Drumgoon Dairy’s remaining employees have made mistakes because of the long hours they’ve had to cover — like reversing a payloader into a manure pond — or because they’re new to working on the farm.
“Some of them only get one or two days off in a 15-day period,” Elliott said. “But what else do you do? Do you just let cows starve or calves die because there’s no one there to take care of them?”
Some nearby farms sent workers to help at Drumgoon for a couple of days at a time this summer after the audit. Elliott and her husband have spent over $110,000 on recruiters and transportation so far to hire 22 visa workers from Mexico. But the visas come with restrictions on the types of jobs workers can do, so Elliott hired a dozen or so new employees locally, and still wants to hire another 10 to 15 people to replace terminated staff.
Elliott is struggling to find local applicants, which she is required by law to attempt before hiring visa workers. 
“If raising wages even more will bring Americans to work on the farm, we can try it,” Elliott said, “but there is a limit to how high you can raise wages when you don’t get to set the price of milk. Can I afford to pay a milker $25 an hour? At some point, you’d produce milk for more than you’re receiving for it.”
Trump could lead immigration reforms, Thune says
After a panel discussion at the annual Dakotafest agricultural trade show in Mitchell in August, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, told South Dakota Searchlight that he believes President Donald Trump is interested in legal immigration and work visa reforms.

“If we can find some willing partners in the Democrats, some sort of an immigration policy or a piece of legislation that we could pass is not outside the realm of possibility,” Thune said. “Ultimately, that’s the best long-term solution, and I’ve heard him talk about it.”
Sen. Rounds told Searchlight that as more people are deported and industries are disrupted, “we will get enough support from the administration to begin looking at a legal system again.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who is running for South Dakota governor next year, said some visa programs should be modified to meet the needs of the dairy industry. Some visas are seasonal programs that require participants to return home after a few months. The programs don’t fit the needs of dairy operations that require workers year-round.
Elliott has broached the issue for years to Thune, Johnson, Rounds and other federal officials.
“All I hear is, ‘I’ll mention that. We’ll talk about that.’ But nothing,” Elliott said. “What we hear is there is absolutely no passion for any kind of change to the status quo.”
Farmers suggest solutions
Lynn Boadwine of Boadwine Farms in Baltic has “run out of gas” trying to advocate for visa and immigration policy changes to support the dairy industry. But he was heartened to hear the congressional delegates’ comments.
“There’s rhetoric, but are you really working on it?” Boadwine said. “I hope they are, because the clock is really ticking on all of these issues and we’re going to start to run out of people.”

Boadwine shared immigration reform ideas with congressional offices but hasn’t heard back on the topic. His hope is to modernize and simplify the H-2A visa program for dairies. His proposal would remove the seasonality requirement and allow workers in the country without legal permission to transition to guest-worker status. Long-term guest workers would have a path toward permanent residency by proving they are law-abiding, hardworking employees.
VanderWal, with the South Dakota Farm Bureau, said he met this spring with Noem in Washington, D.C., in his capacity as vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. He urged Noem and the Trump administration to back off on audits in the agricultural industry in hopes that Congress would “fix the system.”
“We wanted to impress upon the administration that if they started removing illegal workers up and down the food chain, from production to processing to transportation to grocery stores to restaurants, we’d see a disaster worse than the pandemic,” VanderWal said.
The administration has since “backed off ag,” VanderWal said, but the consequences linger for producers like the Elliotts and their employees. He said that unless President Trump “gets real forceful and goes after it,” he doesn’t expect Congress to undertake legal immigration reforms.
Economic consequence predicted
At Drumgoon Dairy, Elliott has tried automating aspects of her operation. She and her husband put in 20 robots a few years ago with the expectation they could hire students from nearby Lake Area Technical College’s robotics program to maintain them.

They posted robotics maintenance positions to attract graduates, but the response was deflating.
“To date, no one,” Elliott said.
She plans to remove the robots because the cost of running and servicing them is too expensive. So far, they’ve sold three. If the cost of technology continues to be prohibitive or there aren’t reforms to workforce visa or immigration programs, she said, “I wonder how we will become a sustainable industry.”
Elliott fears there will be consequences and higher prices for milk and other consumer dairy products without action at the federal level. Boadwine agreed.
“If we keep down this road we’ll have no choice but to import more food,” Boadwine said, “and the reason we’d import more is because it’s gotten so much more expensive here because we crippled ourselves.”

CWIP lets utility companies bill customers for certain construction costs while projects are still underway, rather than waiting until they are finished and producing power. Supporters say the change will spur growth in Missouri’s energy industry and help finance capital-intensive infrastructure.
Missouri’s history with CWIP tells a cautionary story. In 1976, rising electricity rates to finance the Callaway Nuclear Power Plant sparked widespread consumer outrage. 
A grassroots group, Citizens for Reformed Electrical Rates, mobilized against Union Electric’s use of CWIP to fund the nuclear project’s construction. Through community organizing and signature collection, the group placed Proposition 1 on the November ballot to ban CWIP statewide. Missouri voters overwhelmingly supported the prohibition, passing it by a 63% to 37% margin.
Their skepticism was vindicated in the years that followed. Like many nuclear projects of the era, the Callaway Plant faced major construction challenges that proved costly and time-consuming. Originally planned as a two-unit facility, the project encountered the same difficulties that plagued nuclear construction nationwide.
Only one reactor at the Callaway Plant was ultimately completed and brought online in 1984. The second unit was left unfinished after Union Electric cited financial risk to investors, acknowledging that the costs and uncertainties had become too great to justify completing the original plan. 
Several decades later, the company, now operating as Ameren, attempted to revive the second unit by seeking regulatory approval to restart the shelved project. By 2015, Ameren again abandoned the effort, citing long-term capacity needs, declining costs of alternative generation, and Missouri’s regulatory framework. 
While lawmakers stopped short of reviving CWIP for nuclear plants, they did reintroduce the policy for natural gas power plants. That shift represents a significant transfer of risk: Ratepayers now bear construction costs and associated risks that were once carried by utility shareholders.
Critics of the bill point to substantial campaign contributions made by utility companies to Gov. Mike Kehoe and many legislators who supported the measure. This alignment between political influence and regulatory benefit raises concerns about whose interests are being served.
Yet CWIP’s appeal remains strong. In a Republican trifecta state, where energy independence and large-scale infrastructure investment are politically popular, the promise of economic growth may outweigh caution for many voters.
But CWIP carries unintended consequences well known in regulatory economics.
Guaranteed profits can lead regulated monopolies to over-invest in capital to inflate their rate base and maximize returns. By allowing utilities to earn a return during construction, CWIP amplifies this distortion. 
A utility guaranteed payment regardless of delays or overruns has every incentive to pursue larger, slower, and more expensive projects, even when cheaper, more flexible alternatives exist.
Missouri’s new law compounds this risk. First, CWIP recovery is tied to a project’s estimated cost and timeline, yet the statute requires no independent verification of those estimates. 
Utilities may submit inflated projections that become the basis for higher rates, with little oversight until years later. Second, refunds are only available if the Missouri Public Service Commission, whose commissioners are appointed by the governor, finds that costs were imprudently incurred or that a project failed to meet a reasonable timeline. Neither term is clearly defined, leaving ratepayers vulnerable to subjective interpretation and political influence.
Third, while CWIP eligibility for natural gas projects is set to expire in 2035, the Public Service Commission may extend the policy to 2045 with a single hearing and a good cause finding. This allows CWIP to continue without legislative review, insulating the policy from democratic accountability.
From the standpoint of economic efficiency, CWIP embeds perverse incentives into Missouri’s energy framework. Consumers assume the financial risk of construction, while utilities enjoy guaranteed returns. The result may be projects that are oversized, delayed, and misaligned with least-cost planning, decided not by market discipline but by an unelected commission.
A more effective reform would require utilities to commit a greater share of their own capital before recovering costs through CWIP. Rather than allowing full ratepayer financing from the outset, Missouri could mandate that utilities fund a substantial portion. This would ensure that utilities have meaningful financial exposure, aligning their incentives with cost containment and timely delivery.
Such an allocation would help distinguish viable projects from speculative ones. When utilities must risk their own capital, they are more likely to pursue investments that deliver affordable, reliable power and not just those that expand their rate base. At the same time, the law should impose clearer statutory definitions for prudence and timeliness and require independent review of project estimates.
Missouri deserves an accountable energy policy, not one that socializes risk, privatizes reward, and leaves consumers footing the bill for utility excess.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-73069215-1024x687.jpg,,,2025-10-10 07:56:49.476857

Ole Miss is a 32.5-point favorite, and that’s far and away the largest point spread in college football this week. Still, it  would not surprise this writer if the Rebels were to cover that spread by halftime. This is a Washington State team that lost 59-10 to North Texas State. This is an explosive Ole Miss team, ranked No. 4 in the land, that can score points quickly.

But that’s not the point of this column. If Washington State-Ole Miss seems like a weird matchup, well, that’s because it is. It is also a sign of the times in what has become an increasingly strange world of college athletics, which is my point.
This game was scheduled last October in an emergency situation for both schools. Ole Miss had to find a game because Wake Forest reneged on a return match with Ole Miss after the Rebels beat the Deacons 40-6 last September. (If you can’t compete with  ‘em, drop ‘em, I suppose.) Meanwhile, Washington State was in the midst of needing to almost totally rebuild its schedule after the Pac-12 Conference disintegrated. In fact, even after scheduling the Rebels, Washington State still needed five more games to complete its 12-game 2025 schedule. That’s why the Cougars are playing an eclectic schedule that includes games against such unnatural rivals and strange bedfellows as James Madison, Louisiana Tech, Toledo and Virginia – and two games in one month against Oregon State, the only other Pac-12  rival remaining after the league’s mass exodus.
Really, what happened to the once-proud Pac-12 is just nuts. Washington, Oregon, Southern Cal and UCLA left for the Big Ten, which has become, in actuality, the Big Eighteen. Arizona, Arizona State and Colorado scrambled into the Big 12 (which now has 16 teams). And Stanford, located as it has always been in Palo Alto, California, is now a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference, as strange as that sounds. That really is nuts.
So, Southern Cal and UCLA now play conference games three time zones away in Piscataway, New Jersey, and College Park, Maryland. That’s not just for football, mind you. That’s all sports. College athletes will spend nearly as much time in jets  as they do in classrooms. This week, Stanford’s volleyball team will play conference games at Boston College and Syracuse, then fly back across the continent to play conference games against Miami and Florida State. Nuts, I tell you. 
Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin, who once coached in the Pac-12 at Southern Cal, laments the demise of that league.
“I think the whole thing’s sad, the whole conference alignments and especially that one,” Kiffin said at a press conference this week. “There’s so much history with UCLA and USC and that conference in the Pac-8 and then 10 and then 12, and now they’re flying all over the country and teams flying out there and these weird kickoff times, and I understand it. All these decisions made by conferences and schools are always about money. I get it. It is what it is. It’s just, I don’t think it’s good outside of the money. I think it’s bad for the kids and their travel and their school and rivalries and fans, especially that conference where everybody’s way over there and it’s just the whole thing’s sad.”
And nuts, he might have added. 
Because of his time in the Pac-12, Kiffin does have much more familiarity with Washington State than most Mississippians. His USC teams faced the Cougars twice, winning 50-16 on the road against a Washington State team coached by Paul Wulff in 2010 and losing at home 10-7 in 2013 to a Mike Leach-coached Cougars team. Kiffin’s memories of that 2013 game aren’t likely pleasant. The loss came in the Trojans’ home opener at the Los Angeles Coliseum and ended with boos raining down on Kiffin. USC fired Kiffin three weeks later.
To say Kiffin has turned his career around in the dozen years since is an understatement of immense proportions. To says Washington State’s fortunes have diminished over that same time period is a similar understatement.
To says college sports have gone haywire over that same 12 years is perhaps the biggest understatement of all. By the way, Ole Miss comes out pretty swell financially from all this. Wake Forest had to pay Ole Miss $700,000 to cancel the game. Ole Miss only had to pay Washington State $400,000 to come to Oxford. That’s a net profit of $300,000. In today’s crazy world of college sports 300K will get you, at the least, a pretty decent linebacker.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/06173834/AP_21210757215514-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-10 07:56:49.476857

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Editor’s note: The following is a response to a recent guest commentary about the sale of the parent company of Minnesota Power to a consortium that includes massive asset manager BlackRock. We’ve also included a response to the response, below. 
Across the country and around the world, the ways that we produce and use energy are rapidly evolving. 
As our energy system transitions to a cleaner future, careful oversight of our utilities and their decisions will continue to be an urgent need. Fortunately, Minnesota is home to one of the most robust utility oversight frameworks in the country, with comprehensive planning requirements, transparent regulatory processes, and a deep bench of talented advocates working in support of the public interest.
That’s why I was especially dismayed to read Alissa Jean Schafer’s recent guest commentary in the Minnesota Reformer, which was riddled with inaccuracies about Minnesota’s nation-leading approach to utility planning as it discussed the now-approved acquisition of ALLETE, Inc., by a partnership consisting of Global Infrastructure Partners, a subsidiary of BlackRock, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. 
Based in Duluth, ALLETE is the parent company of Minnesota Power, an electric utility serving approximately 150,000 residents in northern and central Minnesota. Like all electric utilities, Minnesota Power is under immense public and market pressure to produce electricity from cleaner sources of generation. Clean energy has enormous economic benefits, from local job creation to avoided fuel costs. However, transitioning our entire energy system from one primarily based on the combustion of fossil fuels to one based on clean renewable sources is inherently a capital-intensive process. This is a real challenge for smaller utilities like Minnesota Power, and deeply complicated context for utility regulators to assess as they evaluate various utility proposals.  
Against this backdrop, a wide array of advocates, stakeholders, and public agencies have worked to analyze the proposed acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power and assess the likely impacts on the customers and communities that the utility serves. This culminated with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approving the sale on Oct. 3, contingent on a number of conditions. 
Schafer’s published opposition to the acquisition is not my concern, and I will refrain from offering a personal position on the acquisition itself. However, I do take significant issue with many of the statements and inferences made about institutions and organizations working in Minnesota that I know to be highly credible, ethical, and fully committed to the public interest. This includes Fresh Energy, a Minnesota-based clean energy nonprofit for whom I serve as a volunteer board member. 
Recklessly undermining Minnesota’s regulatory institutions and advocacy community, as the author does throughout her article, is the opposite of looking out for the public’s interest. 
A particularly egregious example is the claim that Minnesota’s 100% by 2040 clean energy requirement would somehow be undermined because “there’s no requirement that BlackRock advance this clean energy vision.” This is factually incorrect. Minnesota’s 100% law is the same for all investor-owned utilities and enforced by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission through a rigorous process known as Integrated Resource Planning. Minnesota Power’s clean energy obligations under law will not change as a result of the acquisition.
Another example is the claim that Minnesota Power would “no longer be owned by the people it serves.” Minnesota Power is currently a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, with the vast majority of the company owned by institutional investors with no direct connection to Minnesota. In fact, BlackRock itself currently owns approximately 12% of ALLETE; already the largest shareholder. Minnesota Power is not a cooperative. It’s not a municipal utility. It is, currently, a for-profit corporation predominantly owned by institutional investors and subject to regulatory oversight by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. That will not change as a result of the acquisition.   
To play this loose with the facts is fundamentally reckless. At a time when the public’s faith in public institutions is at an all-time low, it isn’t surprising that “piling on” in this manner might be a tempting strategy from any number of perspectives — driving clicks on news sites, driving fundraising for advocacy organizations, etc. But I believe that anyone who purports to work in the public interest has an obligation to seek truth, to strive for accuracy and to hold themselves accountable for the outcomes of their decisions and actions. 
The proposed sale of Minnesota Power is incredibly complex, and reasonable minds can reach differing conclusions. But facts are facts, and Minnesotans are best served when hard decisions are based on careful analysis, hard data and thoughtful debate. I’m proud that Minnesota’s Public Utilities Commission continues to meet that standard. Guest editorials in the Reformer and beyond should do so as well.
Editor’s note: Alissa Jean Schafer gave the following response. 
Matt Schuerger’s defense of BlackRock’s ALLETE acquisition ignores the concerns raised by Minnesota’s own administrative law judge who recommended against the deal. 
After reviewing written and verbal testimony — including “highly confidential” materials not released to the public — the ALJ found that “the Petitioners did not prove by a preponderance of evidence that they will be unable to meet the Carbon Free Standard absent the acquisition, nor did they guarantee or present sufficient evidence showing that the standard will be met as a result of the acquisition.”
A key reason: Private equity firms often only hold companies for a few years before selling, which raises the possibility that BlackRock would do nothing to move Minnesota Power toward the 2040 obligation before another sale. The ALJ highlighted this risk: “(A)n early exit would likely be uneconomic and inefficient, and the record demonstrates that such an exit by the Partners is highly plausible.” 
Even more troubling, the ALJ noted that “the Petitioner’s agreements and private discussions do not comport with their public statements.” That finding should raise alarm for anyone who cares about transparency. Schuerger also downplays what this sale really means for Minnesotans when noting that Minnesota Power is already investor-owned. That misses the point. Private-equity ownership is not the same as being publicly traded. As the name “private” implies, firms like BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners rely on opaque structures, high debt, and short-term profit extraction. 
As the ALJ stated “The nonpublic evidence reveals the Partner’s intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2165923397.jpg,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243

Sign up for their newsletter here.
This is the last of three articles about Michigan communities organizing to stop the construction of energy-intensive computing facilities. 
A log cabin building surrounded by forest in the expansive wilderness of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula houses the Lake Superior Academy, a school focused on environmental education for its K-5 students.
The Dafter Township property was an ideal setting for its programming, until March, when a bitcoin mining operation came online directly across the street. The mine’s loud, steady hum forced students indoors and disrupted their education, school officials reported. Birds the students once tracked even seemed to be driven off by the din.
“Prior to the bitcoin mine moving in, it was just a beautiful spot for learning,” the school’s director, Susie Schlehuber, told a local news outlet in June. “Our whole school philosophy, everything we were founded on, has been disrupted because of the noise.”
In July, the school sued and secured a temporary restraining order requiring the mine’s owner, Florida-based Odessa Partners, to shut down as the lawsuit was litigated. The two sides are currently in mediation. Odessa did not respond to a request for comment from Inside Climate News.
The mine has stirred up an ongoing saga that has resulted in the legal battle and drawn outrage from residents who have demanded answers from local leadership about the operation’s energy use, water use, water pollution and impacts on utility rates, among other issues. Bitcoin mines require huge amounts of electricity, and most consume high levels of water to cool their servers.
Some residents are mobilizing to push for more protections against bitcoin mines in municipalities across the Upper Peninsula. A nearby township put a moratorium in place; other municipalities are considering taking action.
The controversy has been a “wake-up call,” said Kalvin Carter, project director for Up North Advocacy, a nonprofit.
“It’s really the wild west with the mines because there are no regulations, it’s just go do it while you can,” Carter said. “A lot of these communities and boards don’t know what a bitcoin is, and it’s hard to regulate something when you don’t know what it is.”
He said he fears data centers, which bring similar problems, will come next if protections aren’t put in place.
Dafter Township, a small town of about 1,300 people just south of Sault Ste. Marie in the eastern Upper Peninsula, is among flashpoints in Michigan in which grassroots campaigns from across the political spectrum have, or may, derail plans for data centers and bitcoin mines.
The Upper Peninsula is attractive to the operations because of its cool climate and abundant access to water, and the Odessa mine is one of three operating in the region.
Carter said many residents were dismayed to learn that the Cloverland Electric Cooperative, which serves much of the Upper Peninsula, has advertised for bitcoin mines and was involved in bringing the Odessa mine to Dafter Township to generate more revenue.





Odessa’s mine is composed of six metal pods housing large computers that constantly run as they solve complex equations to earn bitcoin, which generates profits for Odessa. The pods sit on 10 acres just across the street from the school, and the project’s fans for cooling the equipment are what generates the din.
Sound readings taken on the school property soon after the mine came online exceeded 70 decibels, which is similar to the sound of a vacuum cleaner.
Michigan does not have regulations in place that specifically provide oversight for bitcoin mines, and proposed legislation aims to incentivize the industry’s growth across the state, and would bar state or local governments from banning cryptocurrency.


It is unclear if the bill has enough support to pass, but people in the Upper Peninsula are not waiting on the state to act, said Chloe Kannan, a resident who works with a small group of volunteer residents working on the issue.
“People are starting to see what this is doing to Wisconsin and other communities across the country, and we know we’re on the largest body of freshwater in the world, and we know we’re a target,” Kannan said.
 “It Was All Stripes of People”

The mine began operations as Lake Superior Academy reportedly put plans into motion for the addition of two classrooms that could accommodate 40 additional children to its current student body of about 90. For now, those plans are on hold. Despite the disruption, the school put up a Facebook post that read “Bitcoin is cool, but not near a school.”
As news of the problem spread, residents from across the region gathered for a June 5 Dafter Township Planning Commission meeting to look for answers and express opposition, Carter said. “It wasn’t tree-hugging leftists or MAGA people afraid of change—it was all stripes of people,” he said.
Odessa had told the township in planning documents that it would build a storage facility, without mentioning that the company planned to house a bitcoin mine, which Carter said generated distrust.
Residents also grew suspicious because a mine representative who was supposed to answer community questions at the meeting would not say who owned the operation, and would not provide his last name.
Meanwhile, questions and concerns have gone unaddressed, Kannan said. It is still unclear how much water is, or will be, drawn from the aquifer, and whether chemicals that could pose health risks or pollute the groundwater are used for cooling. A proliferation of electricity-guzzling mines could ultimately require more fossil fuels to be used or more infrastructure to be built to meet demands.
Lake Superior Academy’s lawsuit asked a county judge to order a preliminary injunction to shut down the mine, order the noise to be reduced and award at least $25,000 in damages. A judge issued the restraining order, and that day Odessa stacked large hay bales around the mine, which dampened the noise.
Among those at the June 5 meeting was Kristi Autore, whose husband, Shawn Merritt, is on the nearby Clark Township Planning Commission. Autore told Merritt about the problems in Dafter. Within about a month, the Clark Township Planning Commission and Board of Trustees had passed a one-year moratorium on mines while the township develops new rules around the facilities.
Autore said she had read about problems with bitcoin mines and data centers in communities across the country, and there was speculation that mine owners were already looking for parcels in Clark Township. She said she suspects they were looking at the area because “electricity is cheap and the water is free.”
“[Clark Township] put a moratorium in place to give us a cushion and some protection so that what happens and Dafter couldn’t suddenly happen to us,” Autore said. “Why invite someone into your community when it’s only going to make life more expensive?”
 Is a Bitcoin Mine Good for Ratepayers? 

In March 2023, Cloverland Electric Cooperative Data put a post on its website that got little attention until two years later when the Odessa controversy hit. It announced that the cooperative was attempting to attract energy-hungry bitcoin mines to its service territory so it could boost energy production and revenues.
The Upper Peninsula’s population is decreasing, and with it, so is energy use. The cooperative has said the mine’s steady energy use will help offset maintenance costs that otherwise would fall on residents.
“Data mining is attractive because when implemented correctly, it can grow electric use, or demand, in a positive way—it has the potential to generate additional revenue through load growth,” the co-op wrote in the 2023 post.
The cooperative’s involvement in bringing “disruptive” bitcoin mines has frustrated some residents, Carter said, and they fear that courting bitcoin mines opens the door for data centers.
A spokesperson for the cooperative did not respond to specific questions from Inside Climate News, and instead pointed to a “data center” FAQ page.
Up to 50 percent of Cloverland’s power comes from hydroelectric, which releases low levels of greenhouse gas, according to the company’s site. It buys the rest of its power from Wisconsin Electric, which uses coal and natural gas to deliver its baseloads. Cloverland has increased its solar production, Carter said, but residents don’t want more solar fields to accommodate bitcoin mines, which are capital-intensive projects that might ultimately negate the purported savings.
“We want to keep our forests and fields and keep the natural beauty, and we don’t want this place being nothing but a solar field,” Carter said.
He added that Cloverland’s rates are already low, so many residents question the need to attract energy-guzzling businesses to keep rates down. Carter said the cooperative largely has not provided clear answers to residents’ questions.
“Cloverland has not been doing a good job reaching out to people and explaining their position, and we love our co-op, so that’s why this hurts doubly,” he said.
While the future is unclear, the issue is bringing together residents in a way that other issues have not, Kannan said.
“There’s a lot of hope here in bringing together in this fight because we know this is not the investment we want,” Kannan said. “We want jobs, we want investment, doctors and lawyers, and an AI data center or bitcoin mines are not going to do that—they’re just going to make people want to leave.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Crypto-illustration-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 06:57:43.944872

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)I responded to former State Superintendent Ryan Walters’ announcement that he will stop statewide standardized testing with a belly laugh.
Even though I would love to get rid of testing for accountability, as opposed to diagnostic purposes, it’s not going to happen soon.
Too many politicians have bought into the claim that state standardized tests are reliable and valid measures of student learning. Too many education leaders are still not ready to explain why the use of standardized tests for accountability purposes has done more harm than good for students.
Ironically, a major study acknowledged that standardized tests are “incomplete measures of educational success” and questioned their reliability in terms of evaluating teachers and students.
And far too few teachers remember the time before the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 when we laughed at the idea that high-stakes testing wouldn’t undermine the joy of learning.
But, we should remember the progress that was being made in the 1990s before standardized testing became a requirement. 
In 1998, according to the reliable National Center for Education Statistics, Oklahoma was above average in reading scores. John Marshall High School, where I taught, was improving more than any other high school in Oklahoma City Public Schools. The autonomy of teachers was respected. We had the freedom to teach in a holistic and meaningful manner. And whenever administrators visited our class, they praised my students’ wisdom, and often offered innovative suggestions.
For instance, the head of the Curriculum Department proposed that we start our classes with the 20th century to get them even more hooked on the love of history. Sure enough, when we’d start World History with Denzel Washington, playing the role of Steve Biko in “Cry Freedom”, or we included lessons about the Tulsa Race Massacre in Oklahoma History, the results were amazing. 
Back then, I posted on the blackboard both the curriculum standards that our class sought to master, as well as a “History in the News” story that was linked to our lessons. The students would come in early to see what our lesson plan was, discuss it, and make suggestions regarding the class discussion topics. 
Understandably, when stakes were attached to standardized tests, too many educators complied with mandates for in-one-ear-out-the-other, teach-to-the-test malpractice. OKCPS’ top administrators announced that they had no choice but to focus on No Child Left Behind tests.
My principals, however, knew that I would not comply with mandates that drove holistic instruction out of schools.  So, we agreed, in case a central office administrator walked in the door, I would keep an “aligned and paced” curriculum guide on my desk. And even though I didn’t ask them to do it, the students would recognize what was happening when a central office administrator walked in, making sure that all teachers were “on the same page.” Students would turn their textbooks’ pages to test questions, pretending to focus on test questions.
In the OKCPS, most of No Child Left Behind’s damage was inflicted on poor, neighborhood schools. Affluent schools were free to ignore the “benchmarks” that became multiple accountability metrics in our higher challenge schools.  
The reformers I knew, who sought to run schools like venture capitalist organizations, sincerely believed that their “build a better teacher” shortcut could produce simpler, cheaper, quicker solutions.
Fortunately, federal regulations no longer require stakes to be attached to standardized tests. The problem today is a culture where educators can be pressured to focus on increasing scores.
Moreover, during the last decade, some of the most fervent supporters of holding individual teachers accountable for test score gains have switched sides. The researcher who perhaps contributed the most to the hypothesis that “building a better teacher” could produce rapid transformative change, now says schools “cannot just ‘hurry up.’” And they can’t use a simple solution, like a better curriculum, to rebuild schools. On the contrary we need to acknowledge how serious schools’ challenges are. 
Another researcher, who once endorsed teacher evaluations that used test score growth, now concludes that desegregation produces the most long-term gains. He and his colleagues urged poor people in Oklahoma County to “move to opportunity” in Canadian County where they would have both better educational and economic outcomes, and longer life expectancy.    
Although the last recommendation could also prompt a belly laugh, these transformations give me hope that Oklahoma can, once again, listen to experts, educators, patrons, and students, and remove the punitive side of standardized testing. 
But, it will take time to reverse the damage that was done over the last quarter of a century.

Unusual use of the Congressional Review Act, also being deployed in some other states, disregards years of public input, critics say.
The post Wyoming congressional delegation wants to override BLM coal lease ban appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration has issued sweeping orders to federal agencies to remove regulatory hurdles and encourage more coal leasing and coal use. Now, Congress is acting to employ a little-used tool to override the Bureau of Land Management and rewrite or install new coal- and mining-friendly public land management plans throughout the West, including one in northeast Wyoming.
Wyoming’s all-Republican congressional delegation introduced a joint resolution Wednesday to employ the Congressional Review Act to essentially invalidate the BLM’s Biden-era supplemental environmental impact statement updating the Buffalo Field Office Resource Management Plan.
Published last year, the Biden-era plan included a ban on future federal coal leasing in the Powder River Basin, citing coal’s human health and climate impacts, as well as the fact that mining companies had not asked for any new major coal leases in the basin in nearly a decade. The joint resolution, if passed, “would terminate the no leasing alternative, revert to the previous plan and prohibit the BLM from issuing a substantially similar plan,” according to a joint statement by Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Harriet Hageman.
The Powder River Basin is home to one of the world’s largest coal deposits and some of the nation’s biggest coal mines.

“Coal is the backbone of Wyoming’s economy, it supports thousands of good-paying jobs, generates the revenue that funds our communities and provides reliable, cheap electricity to Americans across our country,” Lummis said. “Biden’s BLM left us no choice but to stop this dangerous overreach via the Congressional Review Act.”
The Buffalo office oversees 780,291 acres of public lands and 4.7 million acres of mineral estate spanning Campbell, Johnson and Sheridan counties. 
The Senate this week passed other resolutions employing the Congressional Review Act to modify BLM public land management plans, including in Alaska, North Dakota and one in southeast Montana that also included the Biden-era coal leasing ban.
Congress’ move to override the BLM bypasses years of public input and local expertise, and it threatens to “upend the public lands management system as we know it,” according to the nonprofit conservation advocacy group Earthjustice.
“They’re saying, ‘We don’t like the public process. It didn’t achieve the result that we want,'” said Jenny Harbine, managing attorney for Earthjustice’s Northern Rockies Office. “It says, by partisan fiat, the BLM cannot take this substantially sane action [banning coal leasing in the Powder River Basin] in the future no matter what information might support it.”
Using the Congressional Review Act to invalidate land use plans creates a lot of “chaos and confusion,” which may end up backfiring on the fossil fuel and mining industries that President Donald Trump and GOP congressional members say they’re trying to help, according to the conservation group Center for Western Priorities.
If a plan is invalidated, “doesn’t that mean that oil and gas leases or coal leases issued under that [resource management plan] are no longer valid?” Western Priorities Policy Director Rachael Hamby told WyoFile. “What you’re guaranteed to get is uncertainty, which is not good for anyone, including industry.”

Others suggested it’s insulting to Wyoming residents to invalidate a hard-fought compromise among multiple stakeholders who rely on the Buffalo Field Office management plan to guide myriad public land activities, including grazing and recreation.
“Wyoming voices — people who participated in that exhaustive [BLM planning] process — aren’t going to be heard once that [Congressional Review Act] kicks in,” Powder River Basin Resource Council Executive Director Donna Birkholz told WyoFile.
Further, Birkholz said, Congress doesn’t have the capacity or expertise to micromanage such plans to make them work for all stakeholders. 
“People in the West, we tend to get our backs up about people from [Washington] D.C. telling us what to do,” Birkholz said. “Using the [Congressional Review Act] seems like politicians telling folks that their voices are not going to be considered.”
Gov. Mark Gordon joined the Wyoming delegation in support of overriding the BLM to remake the Buffalo Field Office plan, as did the Campbell County Board of Commissioners.
“Campbell County has always known the true value of coal — both to meet baseload demand for affordable, reliable energy and for other non-thermal uses that are emerging as important for the future,” the commissioners said in a statement. “We appreciate the unwavering support we have received from the Trump Administration and our entire congressional delegation to overturn the misguided decisions by the previous administration to eliminate future coal leasing in the Powder River Basin.”
The Wyoming BLM, under President Trump, had already initiated its own amendment process earlier this year to potentially remove the coal leasing ban from the Buffalo Field Office’s management plan. The administration also scheduled two federal coal lease sales this week in the Powder River Basin, testing the mining industry’s appetite for new reserves.
A competitive lease auction on Monday in Montana attracted one bid: $186,000 for 167 million tons of federal coal associated with the Spring Creek mine — a fraction of a penny per ton compared to past coal lease sales that reaped more than $1 per ton. The low bid stunned industry watchers, and the BLM indefinitely postponed a sale in Wyoming — for 441 million tons — that was supposed to happen Wednesday.

Among the fleet was Teton County Search and Rescue’s H125 customized Airbus helicopter, which is hangered in town and available for emergencies year-round. A nine-month fundraising campaign raised $7.5 million for the aircraft, which arrived in 2023 and became the property of the Teton County Sheriff’s Department.
The county’s rescue organization is multi-faceted. Pilot Steve Wilson is employed by the sheriff’s office. The TCSAR Foundation, which raised money for the helicopter, has six employees. About 40 volunteers make up the heart of a rescue team that is skilled in many aspects of wilderness emergencies including swiftwater and cave rescues, lost-person searches, avalanche responses and high-angle extrications.

Possessing its own chopper enabled Teton County to dodge the hassle and uncertainty of contracting for a rescue helicopter seasonally as it did in years past. It allows the team to train regularly and launch rescue missions with little notice in and around the region.
Founded in Switzerland in 1948, ICAR has held its annual congress in the U.S. only once before. The independent, worldwide organization has 85 member organizations in 34 countries. Its main goal is to improve mountain rescue services and safety.
“It’s pretty cool to see the whole world together” said Cody Lockhart, Teton County SAR’s chief advisor, as he surveyed the helicopter display Thursday afternoon. A 15-year volunteer with the organization, he saw representatives from 25 countries converge on his hometown.
During the “helicopter happy hour” dozens of visitors, including school children, got to view the whirlybirds and even climb inside.
The convention in Jackson ran for four days and featured an array of lectures, drills and demonstrations covering everything from helicopters to drones and search dogs.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-10-10 10:24:08+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Parents renew challenge of NJ’s practice of storing baby blood spots,Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/10/10/nj-parents-baby-blood-lawsuit/,Parents seeking to end New Jersey's practice of storing baby blood leftover from newborn disease screenings have filed a new complaint in court.,"Erica Jedynak of Boonton filed a federal lawsuit against New Jersey health officials alleging constitutional violations for the state's secretive practice of retaining blood samples it takes from newborns to detect for diseases. (Photo courtesy of the Institute for Justice)Several parents have renewed their fight challenging the constitutionality of New Jersey’s practice of retaining blood samples from the state’s mandatory newborn disease screening program, two months after a federal judge dismissed their first lawsuit.
The parents filed an amended complaint Monday, pushing back on U.S. District Court Judge Georgette Castner’s August ruling that they failed to prove they have a possessory interest in their children’s leftover “blood spots,” which hospitals take by pricking the heels of newborns.
Attorneys representing Erica and Jeremiah Jedynak of Boonton and Hannah Lovaglio, a longtime Cranbury resident who recently relocated to Ontario, argued that the state does not have a property interest in the blood within children’s veins.
“People’s property and privacy interests in their blood and associated genetic material do not dissipate when that blood is taken physically from inside their bodies by state action,” the attorneys wrote. “Plaintiff Children, via their parents, never voluntarily gave their blood to the state, and New Jersey never sought nor received their consent. Absent such a voluntary transfer of ownership, Plaintiff Children maintain their property and privacy interests in the blood.”
The rise of artificial intelligence has made the matter especially urgent, they noted.
“Artificial intelligence has begun transforming the interpretation of genetic data, and there is a particularly heightened need to maintain privacy and control over blood and the genetic information contained within,” they wrote.
The attorneys also renewed their bid to make the lawsuit a class-action case, given that about 100,000 babies are born a year in New Jersey and are subjected to the mandatory screening. The state retains unused samples for two years for healthy babies and 10 years for newborns who test positive for disease.
Attorneys for the state have argued that retaining the blood spots allows them to use the samples for follow-up testing and develop and validate tests for new diseases, among other things.
The practice was first challenged in 2022, after the state Office of the Public Defender learned that state police had gotten a newborn’s blood spot without a warrant and used it to charge the child’s father with a crime.
The office and the New Jersey Monitor sued after state officials refused to release records showing how often and in what cases law enforcement agencies used baby blood spots to aid in criminal investigations. A Superior Court judge ordered the state in January 2023 to release the records, which showed four police departments used blood spots in five cases.
The Institute for Justice, the Virginia-based public interest nonprofit law firm, sued in November 2023 on behalf of the parents.
The state used to secretly store the blood spots for 23 years until Attorney General Matt Platkin issued a directive in June 2024 shortening the retention time, restricting how spots could be used, and requiring clearer communication with parents.
But those changes don’t go far enough, the parents and their attorneys said. Officials still have not explained what third parties may have accessed the blood spots, and the state still does not obtain informed consent from parents to take and store their babies’ blood, they said.
“As a mother, it concerns me that I have no way of knowing what the government is doing with my child’s genetic information after the initial testing period,” Erica Jedynak said in a statement. “It makes me uncomfortable knowing this information could be used by private third parties, law enforcement, or any other government agency.”

On the heels of Banned Books Week, the Joint Judiciary Committee will consider legislation that threatens libraries' financial stability and Wyomingites' personal liberty, writes Teton County Library Board Chair Marylee White.
The post Wyoming libraries are in trouble appeared first on WyoFile .","Banned Books Week, which wraps up Saturday, has long been a time to celebrate the freedom to read and the value of open access to ideas. This year, in Wyoming, that freedom is under direct threat.

Opinion

The Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee, bolstered by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, will meet at 9:30 a.m. on Monday to consider a bill that would ban “sexually explicit materials” from school libraries and from areas in public libraries accessible to individuals under 18.
Libraries would be fined $50,000 per violation. The bill would allow anyone to sue a library if they believe the policy has been violated. At the October meeting, the committee may entertain amendments to the current bill, possibly exempting materials designed for sex education purposes and sacred texts such as the Bible. Yes, the Bible would be banned under this law. They could lower the fine and may also define an appeal process for libraries. But the real problem with the bill is that it isn’t needed in Wyoming.
We already have robust obscenity laws. What’s new, and dangerous, is the attempt to impose a narrow moral standard on all Wyoming families, regardless of their own values. Parents absolutely have the right to guide their children’s reading, but they shouldn’t decide what other people’s children can or cannot read. This bill would force librarians into the role of moral gatekeepers, while threatening them and our libraries with financial ruin for doing their jobs.
Here in Wyoming, we know the value of our library. It’s not just a place to check out books; it’s a space that supports our kids’ learning, fosters community engagement and provides access to information for residents across the spectrum. 
Decisions about access should reflect local values, not political agendas. Librarians are trained professionals with the best interests of children in mind. Wyomingites should not have their access limited by the government or state legislation. Decisions about library access should come from local library boards and local school boards, with input from the community.
The American Library Association documents “an extremist campaign” to ban or restrict access to books in this display in the lobby of the Teton County Library. (Angus M. Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)
The proponents of this legislation say they aren’t banning books; they just want them to be “shelved appropriately.” But restricting access to a book is, in effect, a ban. The egregious proposed fine would not only have a chilling effect on free speech, but a freezing effect on any county budget faced with the possibility of such a fine, or even the cost of defending against such a lawsuit.
Wyoming’s proposed legislation includes a fine twenty times larger than the $2,500 fine attached to a similar bill that passed the Idaho Legislature but was vetoed by Gov. Brad Little, who deemed it fiscally irresponsible. Little stated that the penalty “will only increase the costs local libraries incur, particularly rural libraries. These costs will be forced onto property taxpayers of Idaho or cause libraries to close to minors altogether.” On the second attempt, the bill passed with a fine of $250. Even with the reduced fine, small rural libraries in Idaho have decided to restrict or eliminate access to patrons under 18 to comply with the legislation, just as small rural libraries in Wyoming may be forced to do.
Beyond the cost, the legislation is likely unconstitutional. Wyoming law already mirrors the U.S. Supreme Court’s definition of obscenity under Miller v. California, which requires that material must be patently offensive and lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The new bill makes no effort to align with that legal standard. It uses broad, undefined terms like “sexually explicit,” which could sweep in countless works of literature — including titles that have won prestigious awards and helped generations of young readers understand themselves and the world.This year, during Banned Books Week, I find myself grieving. Grieving the erosion of First Amendment protections in a state that prides itself on personal liberty. Grieving the pressure placed on local libraries, already stretched thin by funding cuts. Libraries have long been one of the most trusted civic institutions in America, places that provide enrichment and opportunity at every stage of life.
I also will be fighting. I will protest this legislation in memory of my mother, who grew up on a homestead 15 miles north of Medicine Bow, and who told me that the best day of every month was when the Albany County Library’s box of books arrived with the mailman. I will insist on the freedom to read and to encourage my children to read books that challenge, comfort and inspire. In that spirit, I just ordered the three most-banned books in the country today.
Wyoming is a place that values education, individuality and freedom. We should stand up against this unnecessary and dangerous legislation. Our libraries must remain open, inclusive and reflective of the diverse community they serve, not the political whims of a vocal few.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, speaking to CNN about her concerns about rising healthcare costs on American citizens (CNN screenshot)Late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel could barely get the words out of his mouth when he had to say: “I agree with Marjorie Taylor Greene.” 
It was his second time this month, he noted, and added “I need something to wash out my mouth.”  But in truth, the issue at hand, which is access to health care, is no laughing matter.
Greene’s latest defection from the MAGA cult of loyalty for which she has been a leading figure popped up in an exclusive interview with CNN in which she didn’t beat around the bush concerning the effect of the House-passed budget bill that, due to not reauthorizing Affordable Care Act subsidies, has caused the shutdown of the federal government.  
“Everybody is just getting destroyed” Greene told reporters.  “This cliff is coming for millions and millions of Americans where their health insurance premiums are about to skyrocket. Republicans, you have no solutions. You haven’t come up with a new plan in place, and we’re not even talking about it, and it is hurting so many people.”  
Greene’s concerns are at odds with the narrative the GOP is trying to spin on the shutdown — namely that it’s all the fault of Senate Democrats.  Instead, Greene says the healthcare crisis now facing millions of Americans, including her kids and constituents, is a direct threat to Republicans in the polls and voting booths.  
It’s worth noting Greene is also one of four Republican House members who signed the discharge petition to force the release of the Epstein files, telling The Hill:  “I think when it comes to women being raped, especially when they were 14 years old, that’s pretty black and white.”  Moreover, she said Speaker Johnson’s attempts to keep the House shut down was “wrong” and they should reconvene to take care of the vast spectrum of Congressional business.  
For his part, Johnson doesn’t want to reconvene the House due to the recent election of a Democrat who, when sworn in, will provide the final signature to force Johnson to deal with the “Epstein bomb”. 
What could this MAGA rebellion by Greene have to do with Montana?  Well, it’s not so dissimilar from a group of nine Republicans who broke with their own leadership over any number of issues.  Chief among them was health care, and support for a bill by fellow Republican Ed Buttrey to lift the pending expiration of Medicaid expansion for low income people that the Senate’s GOP President, Matt Regier, opposed.   
Like Greene, Buttrey noted that healthcare was critical and Republicans had no other plan: “We have 10 years’ worth of data that shows that the program we designed is working and working well. There’s no need to change it, it’s a savings to our budget, it is providing help for people all across the state, it’s helping save our rural health care facilities.  Why would you want to change that or come up with another plan?”
It’s fair to say the GOP tends to “keep its soldiers in line” when it comes to supporting or opposing leadership positions.  Yet, just as Greene defied Johnson on Medicare funding and Trump on the Epstein files, Buttrey and his nine “rebels” defied their own leadership and governor to support Medicaid expansion. 
None of this spells the end of MAGA, of course.  But it shows that when it comes down to the critical issues that affect the citizens of our nation and state, party affiliation is not and should not be the determining factor — especially when it comes to taking care of each other.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Majorie-Taylor-Greene-CNN--1024x531.png,,,2025-10-10 06:57:43.944872

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)In Idaho, nearly 8% of people on Medicaid expansion work in the food industry for restaurants or fast food chains, a state government report found.
The report by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare details how hundreds of employees for major companies — and even public colleges and government entities — are on the public assistance program.
Walmart, one of the biggest private businesses in Idaho, and Sam’s Club had the most employees on Medicaid expansion, with 444 employees accounting for 1.4% of the employees with known income sources. 
But more than a dozen other big businesses were on the top 25 employer list — including Amazon, McDonald’s and Albertsons. 
Todd Achilles, a former Democratic state legislator turned U.S. Senate candidate, said he requested the report because many state lawmakers were worried about Medicaid expansion’s enrollment growth.
“I’m concerned about it too. But when you peel back the layers, and you understand what’s driving the growth — it’s not a bunch of lazy people that should be able to take care of themselves,” Achilles said in an interview. “It’s people who are working. But they’re working for employers who are manipulating the system to increase their profits, and pushing those costs onto the state of Idaho.”
Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.
In January, Health and Welfare shared the report with Achilles. This week, the agency shared the report with the Idaho Capital Sun.

 Two decades ago, former Republican Idaho House speaker floated a bill on company insurance coverage

In 2018, Idaho voters approved Medicaid expansion through a ballot initiative. The policy extended Medicaid coverage to a population often called the “working poor” that fell in a health care assistance gap. 
Idahoans are eligible for Medicaid expansion if they earn less than 138% of the federal poverty level, which is $21,597 annually for a single person, or $44,367 for a family of four. 
But even well before Medicaid expansion, major companies relying on Medicaid for employee health coverage was on Idaho’s radar. 
In 2005, former Idaho House Speaker Bruce Newcomb, a Republican, was exploring a state law to require Walmart to provide insurance to Idaho employees, or repay the state for its Medicaid coverage, High Country News reported. 
At the time, that idea didn’t gain steam, Newcomb told the Sun this week. But he was fired up about it.
“For a family-owned business like Walmart, to be the richest in the world, having the taxpayers of Idaho and throughout the United States subsidize their operation was just blatantly wrong,” Newcomb said. 
Achilles said many major employers intentionally keep workers in part-time jobs “so they don’t have to pick up the health care costs.”
“This is the hard look that the Legislature needs to do, which is to understand why these highly profitable companies are not taking care of their workers and forcing them to the safety net,” he told the Sun.
This year, the Idaho Legislature and Gov. Brad Little approved a new state law to require people on Medicaid to prove that they work.
In Nevada, a state report earlier this year found that Amazon had by far the most employees on Medicaid, the Nevada Current reported. 
 Report only analyzed a third of Idahoans on Medicaid expansion

The report analyzed the employers and industries that Idaho Medicaid expansion enrollees with known, recent income sources enrollees worked in.

But the analysis, using enrollment figures from November 2024, only tracked about a third of Idahoans on Medicaid expansion, or roughly 30,900 people. The report also excluded enrollees who only reported self-employment income. 
Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson Greg Stahl said the agency hadn’t done this analysis before, and cautioned that the data could have errors. 
“Individuals may have other creditable insurance in addition to Medicaid. Also, the analysis was based on a free form text field which means there could be some level of error in the data compilation,” he told the Sun in an email. “… the information provided excluded self-employment and the data does not provide any context about how many hours per week an individual may work at the listed organization, potentially impacting wages and their qualifications for employer sponsored benefit/insurance.”
In November 2024, when the report’s data is based on, the program’s enrollment was 87,500 people. Now, about 89,600 Idahoans are enrolled in Medicaid expansion, according to the state’s latest figures. 
Nationally, most adults on Medicaid are working, according to the health policy research group KFF. In Idaho, about 48% of able-bodied adults on Medicaid are working, according to an August report by the Department of Health and Welfare. 
 The top industries with workers on Medicaid expansion in Idaho

Here’s some of what the report found:

Restaurant and fast food industry was the top industry, with 7.7% of enrollees with known income sources, or 2,378 employees on Medicaid expansion. Three major chains were in the top 25 employer list: McDonald’s came in fourth, with 246 employees; Taco Bell came in 15th, with 100 employees; and Burger King came in 16th, with 99 employees. 
Home health care or assisted living services was the second highest industry, with 4.6% of enrollees with known income sources, or 1,420 employees.
School districts were the third largest industry, with 4% of enrollees with known income sources, or 1,238 employees. 
Supermarket or grocery stores came in fourth, with 4% of enrollees with known income sources, or 1,231 employees. Behind Walmart’s first place ranking, Albertsons came in fifth, Ridley’s came in 10th, Fred Meyer/Kroger came in 14th, Broulim’s Supermarket came in 24th, and Winco came in 25th.
Universities and colleges came in fifth on the industry ranking, with 3.1% of enrollees with known income sources, or 955 employees. Three of Idaho’s four-year universities were on the top 25 employer list: Boise State University, or BSU, came in eighth, followed by Idaho State University, or ISU, in ninth; and University of Idaho in 17th. 
Hospitals or hospital systems came in sixth place for top industries, with 2.4% of enrollees with known income sources, or 746 employees. Two major hospital systems were on the top employer list: St. Luke’s came in seventh, and Saint Alphonsus came in 21st.

City and state governments were also on the top industry list, along with a range of other fields like child care, dollar stores, churches, construction, hotels and retail stores.

Aftyn Behn, not pictured, slammed Rep. Bo Mitchell, left, during the Democratic primary in Congressional District 7 for Mitchell's acceptance of donations from a payday lender. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A month before the Oct. 7 U.S. House primary, Nashville Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn took two of her political rivals to task for accepting donations from payday lender Advance Financial. 
“You’re not going to like me for asking this,” Behn said from the stage at First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill in Nashville, questioning why Democratic opponents Bo Mitchtell took $25,500 in campaign donations and Vincent Dixie $4,000 as members of the Tennessee state legislature. 
Behn’s attack came up during a part of the forum where the candidates could ask each other questions. She was the only one of the four to take the opportunity to challenge her opponents critically, and on Tuesday, she narrowly won the Democratic nomination for Tennessee’s 7th U.S. Congressional district.   
Behn and businessman Darden Copeland, who finished second in the Democratic primary, used the Advance donations and the issue of corporate contributions more broadly on the campaign trail to separate themselves from Dixie and Mitchell, both of whom also represent portions of Nashville in the state House.
This lender said its loans would help Tennesseans. It has sued more than 110,000 of them.

The Lookout and ProPublica previously reported that Advance Financial has sued over 110,000 Tennesseans in the past decade, trapping some of the state’s most vulnerable in a cycle of unaffordable debt. 
The lawsuits stem from the Flex Loan, a new type of payday lending product created by state lawmakers in 2014 to sidestep federal regulations. Mitchell voted in favor of it at the time.
Advance has used the profits from the new loan to give millions of dollars to mostly Republicans, but also some Democrats, in an effort to protect the company from state regulation.
The special election came as a result of the resignation of Clarksville Republican Mark Green, who represented Tennessee’s 7th district from 2019 until he resigned the seat in July. The district encompasses the northern and western third of Davidson County, portions of Williamson and Montgomery Counties and about a dozen rural counties. It was redrawn in 2022 as part of the state Republicans’ successful gerrymandering, which eliminated a U.S. House seat covering all of Nashville.
The Republican primary was not close at the end
The Democratic primary was closer than the Republican one, which featured more candidates but a last-minute consolidation by the GOP leaders around former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps.
Early in the race, the 11-person GOP field narrowed into a four-way race between Van Epps, Barrett, and state Reps. Gino Bulso and Lee Reeves. But as the race moved from summer to fall, it became clear that Van Epps enjoyed a significant advantage over his opponents because of his early head start — he announced within 48 hours of Green’s resignation — inheritance of Green’s campaign infrastructure and considerable support from dark money political action committees.

Green was an early backer of Van Epps, hosting house parties for Van Epps across the district. Barrett proved to be a powerful challenger, running on the support of the U.S. House Freedom Caucus, the Williamson County grassroots group Tennessee Stands, and his willingness to oppose some Republican donor-favored policies. 
Pro-private school voucher group, Club for Growth, spent around $700,000 running an anti-Barrett advertisement, according to Federal Election Commission filings submitted in the final days of the campaign. 
The race narrowed in the final weeks as it became clear that Bulso’s $500,000 in personal campaign funding and Reeves $300,000 loan were keeping both campaigns alive despite minimal support.
When it looked like Barrett was gaining some momentum against Van Epps, Gov. Bill Lee, who aligned with Club for Growth to pass his voucher plan earlier this year, endorsed Van Epps. 
The money and local support proved sufficient to get President Donald Trump to weigh in with a last-minute endorsement, leading to Reeves’s subsequent withdrawal from the race four days before the election. Van Epps embraced the Trump support at every opportunity, allowing him to cruise to victory..
Six state representatives go down
An overarching question in both primaries was how previous electoral experience would translate into votes.
Behn, a state House member since 2023, and first-time candidate Copeland finished ahead of Dixie and Mitchell, who combined have served 18 years in the state legislature. Copeland also raised more money than any of his Democratic challengers, despite almost no name recognition when the campaign started. 
Van Epps never served in the state House but managed to defeat three state representatives. Barrett, Bulso and Reeves all started serving in the state legislature in the last three years. 
Bulso and Reeves, in particular, struggled to gain traction. When the race narrowed in the final weeks, it became clear that Bulso’s $500,000 in personal campaign funding and Reeves’ $300,000 loan were keeping both campaigns alive.

Democrats’ sliver of hope
The 7th district is rated a solid Republican seat by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Green won the seat by 20 percentage points in the two elections since it was redrawn to include parts of Nashville.
But Democrats have hopes as their 31,000 ballots cast nearly matched the 36,000 Republican votes in the primary. In the past two primaries, Republicans turned out nearly twice as many voters as Democrats, who never turned out more than 25,000 voters.  
Since the last redistricting in 2022, there has not been a competitive primary on either side of the ballot and races have taken place on the midterm and presidential cycle, where turnout is usually higher than in a special election. 
The general election between Van Epps and Behn will take place on Dec. 2.

(Courtesy of Idaho National Laboratory)The future of nuclear power in Idaho is looking strong. The Gem State recently took two important steps demonstrating its commitment to unleashing the potential of nuclear energy. These efforts are working hard alongside other governmental and private partners to meet the need and promote Idaho as a viable state to fill the energy demand of the future.
The first step was taken on Sept. 18 as Idaho released the Advanced Nuclear Strategic Framework. This is a comprehensive plan to guide Idaho in its pursuit of nuclear energy excellence. This means nuclear energy in Idaho that is safe, reliable, affordable, sustainable and secure. The plan lays out the role that the Idaho National Laboratory can play, the importance of educational partnerships in research and workforce development, and the need for regional partnerships on a governmental and private level.
‘Searching for energy solutions,’ Idaho Gov. Little creates new task force to advance nuclear energy

Other points from the plan include creating a State Energy Fund to support nuclear development and using the state’s newly established Strategic Permitting, Efficiency, and Economic Development Council to help streamline project approvals. It also highlights the inter-governmental collaboration of the framework that was formed by the Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Idaho Strategic Energy Alliance.
The second step taken was on Sep. 22, when Gov. Brad Little announced the formation of the Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force. This task force’s chief purpose is to “assess, recommend, and support strategies that advance Idaho’s leadership in nuclear energy innovation, deployment, and workforce development.” This includes making recommendations on matters such as “spent nuclear fuel, fuel creation, enhancement, and minimization, opportunities for Idaho to collaborate with other nuclear-advanced states.”
The task force will be composed of no more than 20 members appointed by the governor, including elected officials, government agencies, INL representatives, private sector stakeholders and educational representatives. This replaces and improves the existing Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission, or LINE, which was put into place by Gov. Butch Otter in 2012. A lot has changed in the industry since then, and this new group helps to prepare Idaho to lead the way.
Gov. Little commented: “As we usher in President Donald Trump’s Nuclear Renaissance, my executive order refreshes our efforts and empowers a new group of leaders dedicated to ensuring Idaho continues to lead the way in nuclear innovation, energy security, and economic growth.”
The setting for his announcement was fitting, as it occurred during the Western Governors’ Association’s first workshop of “Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West.” This meeting was a gathering of government officials, academics, and private sector stakeholders to harness the energy and momentum of the nuclear excitement into plans for tangible progress.
INL Director John Wagner stated at the workshop: “We’re seeing an intersection of multiple factors come together that I haven’t seen in my entire career. It’s been more than 50 years since we brought a new reactor online at [INL], that’s all changing. In the past three weeks alone, we’ve seen groundbreakings for three new reactors — two in Idaho and one in Utah with Valar Atomics — and there will be many more.”
The main sentiment taken from the energy summit is that our region is uniquely positioned to propel the country into a nuclear-powered future. States like Idaho have identified and worked with allies on nearly every level of government, private sector stakeholders, and educational partners to efficiently brainstorm the advancement of nuclear energy. One example is a Memorandum of Understanding signed between Wyoming, Idaho and Utah to collaborate on building out the nuclear infrastructure in the region.
These steps by Idaho come at a time when the federal government has been promoting and advancing policies that seek to facilitate a nuclear energy boom. The Trump administration is making moves to speed up nuclear permitting processes and expand funding for scientific and technological studies.
It is exciting to see that Idaho is also preparing and planning for the needed workforce, pushing resources toward groundbreaking research, and looking for ways to partner with stakeholders to build the needed infrastructure to unleash nuclear energy in America.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)ASHEVILLE — In a convention center ballroom full of elected officials, government workers and nonprofit advocates who have spent the past year rebuilding from Hurricane Helene, the exhaustion is palpable.
So is the optimism.
“I hope that 10 years from now … we’ll think about Helene as the rebirth, the new birth, of western North Carolina,” said Sharon Decker, Gov. Josh Stein’s senior advisor for long-term recovery.
Western North Carolina has begun its long road back from the worst storm in state history, one that will involve rebuilding thousands of homes, businesses and farms, as well as key regional infrastructure. Billions in state and federal dollars have flowed, and continue to flow, into the region.
During a one-year anniversary summit meant to highlight the recovery’s “partnerships and successes” — led by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Southwestern Commission and Land of Sky Regional Council — leaders made it clear they don’t want that money to merely return them to the status quo.
“There are all different sources of grants, opportunities, funding that we’re going to be employing over the next several years to build back better,” said Asheville mayor Esther Manheimer.
Key to that equation: housing and transportation. Rising housing costs, even before Helene, have forced lower-income workers out of urban areas and sometimes out of the region altogether. And a lack of transportation choices left many of those same workers with few options to commute and navigate the mountains.

Helene exacerbated both of those issues, said Tristan Winkler, a planner for the French Broad River region with Land of Sky. Now, many are “trading housing costs for transportation costs.” Future investments, he said, could alleviate some costs for locals.
“Putting housing closer to jobs, closer to a lot of our amenities, that’s a way to reduce transportation burdens on our workforce,” Winkler said.
Housing: What Helene has meant for WNC’s population centers
Since Helene, the number of permits to build single-family housing in the Asheville area have decreased. And the cost of housing as a share of income in the city continues to far exceed the national average.
Many service and retail workers, who fuel the city’s tourism economy, struggle to find homes locally.
“They are kind of continually battling growing prices and a really limited amount of housing stock,” said Sara VanLear, a project manager with the UNC School of Government.
One potential solution: more multi-family housing.
Winkler said permitting for multi-family development was increasing primarily in smaller, unincorporated regions. The large population centers in Buncombe County — Asheville and Hendersonville — are both far less dense than other North Carolina urban centers.
Still, ramping up the building is easier said than done in the mountains, particularly with landslides and flooding still fresh in mind.
“The land that is the most developable … is basically already developed,” VanLear said. “It forces a lot of creativity in thinking how to get development done. That’s already really hard to do.”
Significant public dollars will go toward rebuilding housing in the region over the coming years.
About $1.2 billion in federal grant money will pay for repairs and rebuilds of single-family, multi-family and workforce homes damaged by Helene. Asheville is also set to receive $225 million from that same federal pool of money, $31 million of which will go toward housing.
Transit: Could WNC see passenger rail under revamped infrastructure?
For the past two decades, many of the area’s lower-income workers and renters have opted to move not to Asheville but to surrounding towns and counties.
Those communities generally lack robust transportation infrastructure — little to no bicycle amenities and occasional buses.
But one option for mass transit — long thought to be pie-in-the-sky for the region — could see new life in a post-Helene western North Carolina.

“I do dream of passenger rail service to Asheville,” said Decker, a longtime western business leader and former Secretary of Commerce. “It’s worth pursuit, and I think we need to do it.”
The storm wiped out key chunks of the region’s commercial rail system, forcing rail company Norfolk Southern to begin ground-up rebuilds. That includes the Old Fort Loops, a key 16-mile stretch of rail east of Asheville.
Previously, the infrastructure of the system didn’t allow for passenger rail, said Mary Lesa Pegg, an industrial development manager for Norfolk Southern. But the new plan “does open up the main corridor … in order to get Amtrak.”
Pegg said she’d make no definitive statements or promises, but that the “conversation is alive and well.”
Industry & agriculture: WNC has to ‘get serious’ about resilient infrastructure
As western leaders discussed how the region would rebuild its critical infrastructure, they agreed on a sentiment best summarized by Decker: “We’ve got to think differently.”
“We have got to get serious about focusing on infrastructure to deal with flooding,” said Kaleb Rathbone, an assistant commissioner at the Department of Agriculture. “As a state, and as a society.”
That goes for local drinking water and sewage systems, many of which were knocked offline and are now housed in temporary locations. It goes for key roads and bridges, many of which are privately owned. And it goes for major farms, Rathbone said.
He added that state farming could also benefit from being less reliant on national and regional supply chains. Those supply networks are “part of the miracle of modern agriculture,” he said, but overreliance on them could leave the region without needed goods and materials during and after disasters.
“A focus on having local manufacturers, regional manufacturers … is incredibly important,” Rathbone said.
North Carolina lawmakers have sent money to repair roads and bridges, as well as water systems.  And more than half ($125 million) of Asheville’s $225 million in federal grant money will go toward infrastructure repairs, according to the city’s plan.
But Decker said the scale of recovery and preparedness is bigger than just the public or private sectors alone.
“There will never be enough public dollars to do all that needs to be done,” Decker said. “There will never be enough philanthropic dollars. We’ve got to do it collectively.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3824-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 06:57:43.944872

At her Denver office, DeGette sat with leaders of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3607, which represents workers at the Environmental Protection Agency, and AFGE Local 4012, which represents workers at the Social Security Administration, to hear about how federal workers fear for their job security and the future of their paychecks amid the government shutdown. 
Members in the U.S. Senate failed to reach an agreement on a short-term government funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, before the end of the fiscal year, meaning many major federal government operations shut down starting Oct. 1.

Denver has almost 12,000 federal employees who will be furloughed or “forced to work without pay” during the shutdown, DeGette, a Democrat, said. The Trump administration has suggested it may deny back pay to federal workers affected by the shutdown, a move DeGette said is illegal. 
“If he tries to do that, he will be sued and people will win,” DeGette said. “But that’s little comfort to these employees who … are living paycheck to paycheck and are worried about what’s going to happen.”
DeGette’s office has heard from many constituents who have tried since the shutdown started last week to contact the Social Security Administration or to get passports or veterans benefits and cannot get in touch with anyone to help them, she said.
Justin Bordoff, a legislative advocate with AFGE Local 3607, said the EPA canceled its collective bargaining agreement with the union and other unions that have agreements with the agency. He said the move is illegal and that the union does not know why the EPA canceled its agreement, and the AFGE is challenging the cancellation in court. 










It’s been hard on everyone. We're all overworked, we're all burning out, and they hollowed out all the people with experience, and now we can't backfill.


– Justin Bordoff, of AFGE Local 3607, which represents EPA workers


Neither staff nor leadership at the EPA know what’s going on during the shutdown, Bordoff said, and the agency is in limbo, shut down but maintaining some operations. He said 75% of those he works with have been there for fewer than five years. 
“We at the agency don’t know what we can or can’t do,” Bordoff said. “It’s been hard on everyone. We’re all overworked, we’re all burning out, and they hollowed out all the people with experience, and now we can’t backfill.” 
Coworkers are fearful
Missy Haniewicz is the sole Colorado-based EPA employee whom the agency fired after she was placed on administrative leave in July for signing a letter that expressed concern about the direction of the EPA under Administrator Lee Zeldin. About eight employees have been fired across the country, and she said seven of them, herself included, plan on appealing. 
“My situation is now making my coworkers even more fearful,” Haniewicz said. “I was hoping it would be sort of an example of speaking out, but now I’m fired, so it’s actually an example of don’t speak out.”
Haniewicz said she hopes she wins her appeal and that “they will be too afraid to fire me again,” but she does not expect any improvement throughout the rest of Trump’s presidency. When she was put on administrative leave, she was told it was because of “conduct unbecoming” of a federal employee, because she signed a petition. 
“I think I’m spiteful and I think I am angry, I’m incredibly angry,” Haniewicz said. “And I think that makes me willing to speak up.”
As she works through her appeal, all Haniewicz can do is wait, as the process can take about four months, if not longer during the shutdown. She said she will likely look for some contract work to get by, because while she could look for a full-time job in the private sector, she ultimately wants to go back to working for the federal government. 
Brenda Carsten, a leader with AFGE Local 4012, said many Social Security workers are already living paycheck-to-paycheck, and the elimination of remote work by the Trump administration has increased commuting costs for those workers. The shutdown has added stress, as people are unsure whether they will be paid at all or laid off. 
“We go into federal service because we want to serve and care about American people, and going into work every day and feeling like you’re failing because you’re just not able to provide the services that people desperately need is devastating to employees,” Carsten said.

(Photo courtesy of Nidec Power)An alternator manufacturing company is expanding its operations in Henderson County, investing $52.4 million and adding 200 jobs to its Lexington facility.
Once the expansion is complete, Nidec Power will employ more than 600 people in Henderson County, the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development announced Thursday. This will make the company the county’s second-largest employer, just behind the Henderson County School District.
The company designs and produces “advanced alternators” used to generate power for data centers, hospitals, and defense needs, the department stated. The expanded Lexington facility will allow Nidec to build capacity to “support the increasing electricity demand in the U.S. and abroad.”
Nidec Power is a division of Nidec Motor Corporation, a $16 billion business headquartered in Kyoto, Japan that has employees spanning more than 40 countries. Nidec Power is based in Minnesota and employs more than 2,000 people across North America.
“We have a long history of operations in Tennessee, and our global success is built on the quality and commitment of our outstanding team in Lexington,” Nidec Power President David Strohsack said in the news release. “We are honored to invest in this community that has given so much to our company and our customers.”
Lexington is home to around 8,000 residents and serves as the Henderson County seat. Manufacturing is the county’s top industry in terms of employment, with 51 establishments employing 1,670 people, according to the state’s economic development department. 
“What happens in rural Tennessee matters to all Tennesseans, and I am proud to take part in announcing hundreds of new jobs for the families across Henderson County,” Gov. Bill Lee said in the news release. “Nidec’s investment will be transformative for this community, and I am grateful to the company’s leadership and long-term dedication to creating greater opportunity for Tennesseans.”
Nidec became Henderson County’s third-largest employer in May, when the former titleholder Adient, an automotive seat manufacturer, announced it would permanently close its facilities in Henderson and Maury Counties, eliminating more than 400 jobs in West and Middle Tennessee.
Nidec currently employs around 400 people in Lexington. The company received $1.8 million in economic development grants from the state when it announced a 300-employee, $18.7 million expansion of its Henderson County footprint in 2018. 
It’s not yet clear how much the state has offered Nidec for the expansion announced Thursday.

 Monty Sullivan was appointed to the position in 2014 after previously serving as chancellor of Delgado Community College in New Orleans for two years and working in various administrative positions at multiple colleges and universities for more than 30 years. 
“While this marks my retirement from LCTCS and working in Louisiana, my work in advancing opportunities through education will continue,” Sullivan said in a news release announcing his retirement. “The mission that has guided my career does not end here. I look forward to the next chapter.”
LCTCS Board Chairman Tim Hardy praised Sullivan’s leadership in a news release. 
“He led with vision, belief and compassion,” Hardy said. “He put students first. Under his guidance, LCTCS has become a national model for how community and technical colleges can power economic growth and individual opportunity.” 
During Sullivan’s tenure, the system nearly doubled its number of graduates. Sullivan has played a key role in advocating for higher education and workforce development policy at the State Capitol, including championing the creation of the M.J. Foster Promise Program, a scholarship program for adult learners pursuing professional credentials. 
Sullivan also drew national recognition and advocated for workforce education at the U.S. Capitol. Earlier this year, members of Congress expanded the Pell Grant program to help low-income students pay for workforce credentials. 
The system has not yet announced a timeline for selecting Sullivan’s replacement.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)Bankers, public officials and an academic observer are cautiously optimistic in the wake of the Bank of North Dakota’s announcement of plans to create a new digital currency. 
The state-owned bank announced Wednesday it will create the Roughrider coin, a form of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin that will be tied to the value of the U.S. dollar. The goal is to facilitate near instant transfers of money between banks. 
Unlike bitcoin, stablecoin is not subject to volatile price swings because it’s backed by conventional financial assets, overwhelmingly the U.S. dollar.
Bank of North Dakota leaders featured the announcement during a conference focused on innovation affecting financial institutions.
“They’re taking a step forward into new technologies, and certainly the creation of the Roughrider coin as a stablecoin could offer some great opportunities for our institutions,” said Rick Clayburgh, president of the North Dakota Bankers Association.
Bank of North Dakota to launch state’s first stablecoin known as Roughrider coin

Some banks in North Dakota have been looking into the new stablecoin technology even before the Bank of North Dakota’s announcement, said Sarah Getzlaff, CEO of Security First Bank of North Dakota. 
“We’ve been looking into stablecoin, we’ve been learning about stablecoin, and so I’m interested in learning more about the Roughrider coin,” Getzlaff said. 
Alexis Baxley, president of the Independent Community Banks of North Dakota, said the Bank of North Dakota has been a great partner for community banks and she’s excited to learn more about their plans for the Roughrider coin.
“The devil is always in the details,” Baxley said. “As long as they do a good job managing the risk and managing those details, we’ll be interested to see how this works out.”
State Sen. Dale Patten, a Republican from Watford City and a retired banker, said it’s important for the industry to get a better understanding of these new concepts. 
“The concepts are challenging for people to understand,” Patten said. “I think that is probably the most critical thing, is developing that baseline knowledge and understanding of how it’s going to work.”
Ali Jaffri, an assistant professor of finance from North Dakota State University, attended the conference to gather information for a course he’s developing. Jaffri said it will be critical for financial institutions to adopt the new technology to remain competitive. 
“This is the future, so people and the institutions should adapt to it,” he said. “Otherwise, it would be very hard to compete with this fast-paced environment.”
Potential concern
One concern about stablecoin is how the new technology will affect banks’ balance sheets if the digital currency is adopted by the general population. 
The Genius Act, federal legislation signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, requires that each stablecoin issued be matched by a U.S. dollar or equivalent asset, such as a short-term U.S. Treasury note, in reserve to ensure there is always enough liquidity for the stablecoin to be redeemed into traditional currency. 
“There’s concern as well from the banking industry that it can possibly drain deposits from an institution, not just North Dakota, but across the country, and can cause issues with banks. A bank deposit is very important to an institution, because that’s what’s used to loan money out,” Clayburgh said. 
There is an estimated $300 billion worth of stablecoins in circulation right now. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testified to Congress earlier this year he wouldn’t be surprised if that grows to more than $2 trillion by 2028. 
Lise Kruse, commissioner of the North Dakota Department of Financial Institutions, which regulates state-chartered banks and credit unions, said there is concern nationally about that. 
“A stablecoin means a dollar for dollar reserve. Where is that reserve going to come from? Does that mean that $1.7 trillion is going to come out of the banking system, the community banks and regional banks?” Kruse said during Wednesday’s conference. “So if you are seeing on a national level that bankers are a little bit concerned, it’s because that money will not be available for the bank to lend.”
Clayburgh said any reduction of deposits “impacts the economy, impacts Main Street, impacts small business, impacts farmers. So we’re trying to understand these issues.”
Managing risk
The Roughrider coin’s initial rollout, planned for next year, will be a pilot program and will not limit the Bank of North Dakota’s liquidity, according to bank leaders. 
The pilot program will be intentionally limited in scope, according to Bank of North Dakota President and CEO Don Morgan. The stablecoin will only be used for bank-to-bank transactions and the program will involve a handful of local banking partners.

“We’re not looking at any type of material liquidity pressure on the Bank of North Dakota or on North Dakota’s banking industry anytime in the near term,” Morgan said at a press conference after Wednesday’s announcement. 
The chief operating officer of Fiserv, the company partnering with the Bank of North Dakota to create the Roughrider coin and build out the technical framework, said the use of stablecoins in bank-to-bank money movement should be thought of as a way to increase efficiency.
“You will start moving money 24/7 with minimal impact on anything else,” said Takis Georgakopoulos, Fiserv’s COO. 
Georgakopoulos said there are ways to work around liquidity concerns if the Roughrider coin is ever made available for consumer use, and “we’re going to work with the Bank of North Dakota to find the right way to do that.”
The first “use case” of the Roughrider coin will be bank-to-bank transactions, offering nearly instant movement of money even outside of business hours and across international borders. Morgan said “we still see tremendous value in that” even if there is never a widespread use of stablecoin by consumers. 
But the Bank of North Dakota will also continue to prepare, internally and in coordination with local partners, for consumer use of stablecoins like the Roughrider coin to ensure local banks and credit unions have the option to offer it to customers down the road. 
“It really sets our banking and credit union industry up for our state to be ready for what’s coming,” Morgan said. 
Kruse is confident North Dakota’s banking industry can handle risks that come with new financial technologies like stablecoin. 
“Risk is risk,” Kruse said. “I think banks understand that and they know how to manage it.”
The Bank of North Dakota is always conscious of risks, Morgan said, because it leverages deposits from the state government to use as lending capital. 
“We are not interested in stepping into high-risk situations. We do not deem this as a high-risk evolution project here,” Morgan said. “With that first use case being bank to bank, that lowers the risk profile for us significantly.”

That money was raised over the past three years — an effort nearly totally funded by massive contributions from a mere 21 donors, nearly all of them corporations or other entities with significant lobbying presences in Washington and/or Frankfort.

A report recently filed by the Republican Party of Kentucky Building Fund with the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance listed the two additional contributions and the project’s expenses between July 1 and Sept. 30. Both the whiskey giant Bean Suntory and the aircraft manufacturer Boeing had made previous contributions to the Republican Party of Kentucky’s Building Fund. (A complete list of totals given by all of the large donors is listed below.)
Kentucky Lantern first reported in early 2023 that the state Republican Party had launched the fundraising drive to expand its headquarters in Frankfort — a drive that got off to a spectacular start with a donation of $1 million from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, apparently the largest donation ever made to a Kentucky political party fund.
State and federal laws limit the amount any person can give to a state political party to $15,000 per year. And before 2017 state law banned corporations from making contributions.
But that year the Republican-controlled Kentucky General Assembly passed a law to make it easy for the GOP to raise the millions it would need to vastly expand its headquarters. That law let political parties establish separate building funds that could accept donations of unlimited amounts from corporations or people.
The Republican Party of Kentucky headquarters is in south Frankfort, about five blocks from the Capitol. It is called the Mitch McConnell Building in honor of Kentucky’s senior senator who is credited with leading the party from decades of minority status to its current dominance in Kentucky politics.

The nearly completed expansion connects the existing headquarters to a new 6,800-square-foot structure on an adjacent vacant lot. The new structure is designed to conform to the residential nature of the neighborhood. It includes a 160-seat auditorium.
Ground was broken for the project last summer.
Reports filed by the RPK Building Fund since early 2023 with the election registry show that $4,206,675 has been raised for the project since late 2022, and that through Sept. 30 the fund has spent about $3,826,000. Those reports show nearly all of that has been paid to three contractors: $3,294,000 to Branscum Construction, of Russell Springs; $261,500 to Stengel-Hill Architecture, of Louisville; and $180,000 to Haney Consulting for fundraising consulting. Haney Consulting is headed by Laura Haney, McConnell’s longtime fundraising consultant.
The Republican Party of Kentucky did not immediately respond to a phone call from Kentucky Lantern or to an email asking questions about the project and the contributions that funded it. 
The Kentucky Democratic Party has not used the 2017 law to launch any fund drive. In the recent quarter, the Democratic Party Building Fund reported just $137 in receipts, $1,681 in expenses, and a fund balance of $284,952 as of Sept. 30.

As federal law cuts off Medicaid funding to organizations that provide abortions, what’s already happened in the Natural State likely will be repeated nationwide.
For seven years, low-income Arkansans who use Medicaid have been unable to have their health care covered at either of the state’s Planned Parenthood locations in Little Rock and Rogers. That includes such services as annual physicals, cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases, though Planned Parenthood’s detractors tend to focus on abortion. Arkansas’ near-total abortion ban became effective in 2022, but the U.S. government had already banned Medicaid funding for abortion in most cases.
Without state Medicaid dollars, Planned Parenthood has had to “fundraise just to keep [the] doors open,” said Emily Wales, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which oversees locations in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri.
Arkansas Medicaid patients in 2018 expressed frustration to their Planned Parenthood providers that they could no longer get care from people they knew and trusted, Wales said. She added that Medicaid reimbursements are so low in Arkansas that many providers do not participate in the program.
“Planned Parenthood, both in Arkansas and nationally, wants to support patients who have Medicaid,” Wales said. “We want every person, whatever their income status, to know that they can get the same high quality services, but because of politics, now those patients are having to find new providers if they can, and many times [they] are facing delays on their care because they can’t find another provider that they can’t get into very quickly.”
Low-income Arkansans can seek care at the state health department’s local health units or at nonprofit community health centers, but unlike Planned Parenthood, those facilities do not specialize in reproductive health care.

Appeals ruling threatens routine care access for Medicaid enrollees at Planned Parenthood

 

People who cross state lines in order to receive health care cannot expect their Medicaid coverage to include services in another state, and interstate travel might not be feasible anyway for people who struggle to obtain reliable transportation and child care, Wales said.
That problem will only be exacerbated if Medicaid patients can’t get care at Planned Parenthood anywhere, she said.
Nationally, Planned Parenthood has identified at least 200 clinics out of about 600 nationally that could close if they cannot treat Medicaid patients and receive reimbursements from the state-federal health program for lower-income people and some people with disabilities.
None of Planned Parenthood’s Great Plains locations are currently set to close, said Hanna Sumpter, regional director of marketing and communications.
Planned Parenthood filed a federal lawsuit in July aiming to block the federal budget reconciliation bill’s provision targeting the organization. A district court judge issued a preliminary injunction, but an appeals court panel overturned the ruling Sept. 11.
The Little Rock Planned Parenthood clinic is under heavy security; a reporter seeking comment for this story was denied access and had to leave contact information via an intercom. 
 Other provider options

The Arkansas Department of Health has local health units in all 75 counties. The units offer no-cost testing for sexually transmitted infection and cervical cancer screenings for uninsured patients and “likely no more than $25” for insured patients, said Ashley Whitlow, the health department’s deputy director of health communications.
Additionally, Arkansas has a network of more than 200 federally qualified health centers that operate under the umbrella of Community Health Centers of Arkansas, a nonprofit that provides health care regardless of patients’ ability to pay. The federal Health Resources and Services Administration designates and funds these centers.

How well the community health centers are filling the gap in women’s health care left by the absence of publicly funded reproductive health care is uncertain, as Community Health Centers of Arkansas CEO Lanita White did not make herself available for an interview.
At a roundtable maternal health discussion last year, White said not enough Arkansans are aware of community health centers.
The current federal government shutdown has created “significant financial challenges” for these centers, according to KFF Health News.
The centers don’t focus on women’s health, but that’s changing as a new Arkansas Center for Women and Infants’ Health has begun working with providers to increase pregnant and postpartum Arkansans’ access to care. 
Arkansas has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and the third-highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement, a nonpartisan, independent health policy center.
Lawmakers and health care providers have expressed concern that the state has trouble recruiting and retaining obstetrician-gynecologists. More broadly, Arkansas had only 9.2 primary care physicians per 10,000 residents as of 2022, according to ACHI.

Arkansas maternal health care landscape needs more coordination and teamwork, physicians say


 Avoiding silos

Krista Langston, CEO of the Arkansas Center for Women and Infants’ Health, previously helped launch Arkansas’ community health worker training program at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences’ Institute for Community Health Innovation. 
“A lot of the FQHCs have decided that they’re going to take on prenatal care because they see that need in their community of being able to enhance access,” Langston said. “At the center, we’re willing to partner with them in order to help them feel prepared to do so.”
Additionally, Arkansas’ Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act of 2025 allows Medicaid reimbursements for community health workers who provide pregnancy-related health services. It’s one of many Medicaid policy changes in the new law that its supporters, including Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said will improve low-income Arkansans’ access to maternal health care.
Langston’s previous job helped lay the groundwork for implementing this new Medicaid policy, she said. It was among the recommendations of a maternal health task force Sanders convened last year.
“It was the first time that we were able to see so many organizations — hospitals, clinics, community-based organizations, faith-based organizations — were working on maternal health initiatives, but it was being done in a silo,” Langston said.
One of the goals of the Arkansas Center for Women and Infants’ Health is to help family medicine providers, midwives and advanced practice registered nurses fill gaps in maternal health care left by the state’s shortage of OB-GYNs, Langston said.
The center is also working on a perinatal care curriculum for community health workers “so we can ensure that women are getting the best support needed while pregnant,” she said. She expects the curriculum to be complete by spring 2026.










We want every person, whatever their income status, to know that they can get the same high quality services, but because of politics, now those patients are having to find new providers if they can.


– Emily Wales, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains


 Referrals and partnerships

In western Arkansas, the 12 facilities under the River Valley Primary Care Services community health centers organization have one women’s health provider who provides pregnancy care up to 32 weeks’ gestation, nursing director Laura Little said. After 32 weeks, patients are referred to local hospitals in and around Fort Smith or as far east as the Johnson Regional Medical Center in Clarksville, she said.
“We have a mutual understanding with these bigger hospitals that once [pregnant patients] get to a certain degree, we refer them out, and then we pick them back up postpartum,” Little said.
Two of Arkansas’ community health center networks — Mainline Health in South Arkansas and Community Clinic in Northwest Arkansas — work with hospitals to ensure the centers’ pregnant patients are a priority for delivery, Langston said.
However, patients referred from community health centers to regular clinics can have difficulty obtaining non-emergent or non-pregnancy-related women’s health care, such as routine STI testing or pap smears, Little said.
“We are seeing that there is a longer wait time just for those routine visits, [but] if you’re pregnant, you can get right in with specialty gynecologists,” she said.
Arkansas Planned Parenthood staff did their best to refer Medicaid recipients to other providers in 2018, Wales said.
If an uninsured patient came to Planned Parenthood before the 2018 policy change, the organization could use its privately raised funds to support the patients in the most need, Wales said. Since the change, those funds have to go toward serving Medicaid clients whose care can’t be reimbursed, she said.
Patients’ ability to see providers of their choice is one of the casualties of cutting off Medicaid clients’ access to Planned Parenthood, Wales said.
“Because the Medicaid defunding attempts are political, the piece that’s lost is the human impact,” she said. “Politicians aren’t often thinking about the individuals who make appointments, know and trust individual providers after seeing them repeatedly, and then show up and find out there’s a disruption in care.”

And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.” 
After 20 years of organizing in rural Colorado, I’ve learned that lasting results come from supporting rather than opposing, from building bridges not tearing them down, from identifying shared solutions, not only pointing at problems. 
This is the Ditch Principle: Your ditch neighbor may disagree with you about everything except keeping the water running —  so you start there. The neighbor who might pull you out of a snowbank doesn’t stop being your neighbor when you disagree about politics. Rural communities practice interdependence because isolation kills.

Friedrich Nietzsche’s warning about monsters isn’t just stale philosophy — it’s practical advice that seems freshly relevant. As authoritarianism rises in America, we face a choice: resist by becoming what we oppose, or demonstrate something better. 
As a longtime climate activist, the current anti-science stance is infuriating and deeply disappointing. But wildfire preparedness is critical right now, and community-wide planning helps everyone regardless of how they understand climate science. 
Instead of doom-scrolling at the edge of the abyss, we should respond by restoring what matters most in the spaces and relationships we maintain, leading forward from the ground up. 
This is a necessity, not idealism. When fire ignites or search and rescue is called, people put down their projects and differences to pull together. We have to get along or nothing gets done. People who honor these expectations are accepted, our contrary politics notwithstanding. 
The damage to both our planet and our institutions is real, extreme and unabated. Two-thirds of Americans recognize we’ve become too polarized and no longer believe partisan politics is capable of solving our problems, according to a recent New York Times poll. Here in western Colorado, the largest voting bloc isn’t Republican or Democratic — it’s unaffiliated voters who want problem-solvers, not partisans. 
Anti-science is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. The erasure of climate data and the dismissal of inconvenient facts to protect powerful interests is a current case in point. But rural communities include practical people. Farmers experience drought, higher temperatures, and climate weirding. Homeowners fear wildfire and feel the risk.
History shows proven strategies to oppose authoritarianism. And rural communities are naturally situated to lead these approaches and reclaim our democratic foundations. 

Build alternatives, don’t just oppose. No one asks who voted for whom when the irrigation ditch needs cleaning. They show up with shovels. This is constructive organizing — demonstrating how things work when people focus on shared needs rather than manufactured divisions. Cooperation is a bulwark against authoritarianism. 
Include everyone, abandon no one. We don’t start with politics when defending vulnerable community assets. Everyone depends on reliable water supply and safe evacuation routes, regardless of where they land on climate policy. We protect those needs notwithstanding the connections between climate, wildfire and drought. 
Navigating diverse perspectives, complicated relationships, and competing interests are not only challenges but tactics in resistance. Authoritarianism wins when we sacrifice groups one by one, including those we find disagreeable. Democracy wins when we expand the circle of concern. 
Practice the democracy you want to see. It’s not only about fighting monsters, it’s about listening and working authentically even when it challenges us. Fair decisions, transparent communication, everyone gets heard — unlike cable politics, we don’t need leaders playing gotcha for narrow advantage. We change minds by creating shared experiences of things working better, solving problems that help everyone prosper. 

The power of rural communities lies in quietly building resilience through relationships spanning decades. With steady focus on what we can control, these relationships outlast any political cycle. The infrastructure that serves everyone endures. 
Authoritarianism requires division to survive and cannot withstand this approach. It needs us to see neighbors as threats, demands we choose ideology over community, that we abandon democratic norms in the name of winning. 
When we refuse that bargain — when we bridge differences rather than divide, include rather than exclude, practice democracy and not just preach it — we make authoritarianism irrelevant. 
The work to restore will outlive us. The best way not to become monsters is to stay neighbors. The ditch still needs clearing. A wildfire needs containing. When someone falls or is lost, it takes teamwork and a broad set of skills to get people out of rugged backcountry and back home to their families. So start there. Build from there. 
E pluribus unum. In shared purpose we remember: The strongest defense against those who would divide us is simply refusing to be divided.

Stubblefield died Sept. 2. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)I knew it had to happen. I figured a lawsuit might be the only chance residents of Senate District 26 would have to choose a new senator before April.
And, so, a Franklin County resident named Colt Shelby filed a complaint Monday against Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester over the date Sanders set for the special election to replace the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who died Sept. 2.
The lawsuit reiterates what others have been saying: the special election date chosen by the governor leaves the people of District 26 — which encompasses parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties — without a voice in the state Senate for the better part of a year, especially during the legislative fiscal session that starts in April.
Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest and others, including Stubblefield’s daughter, have said delaying the District 26 election until after the April fiscal session is a cynical political ploy meant to deprive the district’s voters of a voice in important decisions. 
Those decisions include a likely vote on funding for a 3,000-bed prison proposed for Franklin County. A $750-million prison appropriation bill failed five times during the regular session this spring before its sponsor pulled it down. Stubblefield and King were among the legislators who helped kill it.
Is Sanders so calculating and vindictive that she’d deprive nearly 86,000 District 26 residents, many of whom are strong supporters, of legitimate representation in the Senate? Hard to say, but I don’t think a special election will occur before the Legislature convenes absent a court order.
“The Governor has no constitutional or statutory authority to deny them that representation,” the lawsuit argues.
The petition asks the court to order the general election to be held Dec. 9, rather than June 9, the date set by the governor.
Getting a court to order an earlier election is no sure thing, but it seems a gamble worth taking since I don’t expect the governor to change her mind — again. 
You see, she originally set the primary and general special election to coincide with next year’s March primaries and November’s general elections. Sanders said the timing would save taxpayer money, streamline the electoral process and maximize voter turnout.
She reset the general special election to June “after receiving feedback from the community and getting confirmation from election officials that a change, while difficult, is doable,” she said in a press release announcing the revised date. The primary would still be in March.
Even with the rescheduling, the special election will fall well beyond the 150-day maximum called for by state law. The law allows special election dates beyond that window if the governor determines that doing so would be “impracticable or unduly burdensome.” Sanders used that catch-all phrase to justify both the November and June dates.
What remains evident, absent an affirmative ruling in the lawsuit, is that replacing Stubblefield will take far longer than filling any other vacant legislative seat since 2011, according to an unpublished memo from the Senate legal counsel’s office. King sought an analysis of past legislative vacancies and how many fell within the 150-day window and how many outside of it.
“None of the other special elections called since 2011 were modified after the original call was issued,” the letter says.
Eyebrows raised in astonishment when Sanders changed the election date once. There’s little evidence she would voluntarily reverse course a second time. She’s never been someone who’d publicly bend to pressure, not even from her own party.

(Photo by Jocelyn Jackson/Rhode Island Current)Ric Thornton aims to reduce the $6.2 million dollars worth of outstanding fines for missing or overdue state campaign finance reports by 25% by the end of the year.
The state campaign finance director doesn’t expect to convince former candidates and officeholders to make good on their six-figure debts.
Instead, Thornton is invoking a new state regulation he helped create, which lets the Rhode Island Board of Elections cap fines on campaign finance violations and suspend the old accounts to stop late fees from accruing.
“More than 99 percent of the debt owed is aged over 120 days, so we’re on top of the current debt level very well,” Thornton said in an interview Thursday. “The new regulation is extremely helpful in getting the others down to a collectible level.”
While the election agency has made significant strides in tracking and collecting money on campaign finance violations in recent years, a few dozen offenders — who owe most of the debt — remained unreachable. 
And the $2 daily late fee on any missing or overdue campaign finance reports quickly escalates a manageable fine — $25 for a single missing campaign report, for example — into hundreds of thousands owed.
Recognizing people are unlikely or unable to ever pay that large a bill — and the constitutional problems posed by “excessive” fines — the state elections board approved new regulations last year that cap fines and offer leeway to determine lower amounts. But it wasn’t until September that the panel first exercised its new authority, slashing fines for three of the top debtors on the list. Another six former candidates and office holders’ fines were reduced at the Board of Elections meeting Wednesday. More will be up for consideration next month, Thornton said.
“I am just trying to get them in the queue before we get into the 2026 election cycle,” Thornton explained.










More than 99 percent of the debt owed is aged over 120 days, so we’re on top of the current debt level very well. The new regulation is extremely helpful in getting the others down to a collectible level.


– Ric Thornton, state campaign finance director


He also wanted to wait until the regulatory change was posted on the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s website. While the state elections board approved the change in April 2024, it didn’t file the rule with the Department of State until May 2025. 
Christopher Hunter, a spokesperson for the Board of Elections, said in an email that elections staff had technical problems submitting the regulation through the state’s administrative records office. The elections board also needed to prioritize work related to the 2024 presidential primary before resubmitting the rule change, Hunter said.
Despite the wait, Thornton was optimistic of meeting his year-end deadline. The nine candidates whose cases have come before the election board thus far originally owed nearly $2.2 million combined in fines and late fees. Thornton’s recommendations, all of which were approved by the elections board under separate, unanimous votes, slash their combined debt nearly 96% to $90,612. 
“I anticipate that once we get through this inventory, we won’t really need to use this regulation again,” Thornton said. “We are very on top of our current debt level.”
Even if the longstanding debtors don’t pay, it’s no longer  Thornton’s problem. The reduced fines also come with a referral to the Rhode Island Department of Revenue’s Central Collections Unit. If the reduced fines aren’t paid within the specified time frame — usually 90 days — state debt collectors will crack down, with the ability to garnish wages and place liens on assets.
“A big part of this has been just trying to track these people down,” Thornton said, noting that many people who owe money for campaign finance violations have moved out of state and changed phone numbers.
 As part of his presentation to the elections board, Thornton was asked to estimate the labor and postage costs for his team’s continued outreach to candidates and officeholders; under state law, the elections board sends two mailed notices each quarter for campaign finance reports, along with phone calls, house visits and in some cases, subpoenas. These efforts have proven largely fruitless — nearly all of the candidates with six-digit debt never responded to attempts to contact them, Thornton told the elections board.

Taking accountability…or not
Former candidates and officeholders were also given an opportunity to explain their plights directly to the elections board at its September and October hearings. Three came Wednesday, offering a mix of chagrin, indifference and defiance.
The latter came from Jonathan Joseph Keith, who ran for Cranston School Committee in 2014, followed by three unsuccessful state Senate runs in 2016, 2018 and 2020. Keith filed regular reports with the elections board during his first three candidacies, then closed his account. When he ran for a final time in 2020, he opened an account, but never filed any of the required reports on fundraising and spending during or after his campaign. Now, he owes more than $43,500 based on 22 missing reports and late fees on five other submissions, Thornton said.
Keith, however, insisted that because he did not raise or spend any money during his 2020 campaign, he did not have to file any reports on his activity.
“This has all been a waste of my time,” Keith said Wednesday. 
The board postponed a vote on his debt, asking for a written request from Keith for its legal counsel to review.
Five other candidates had their fines reduced under a series of unanimous votes at the same meeting. All but one were given the standard 90 days to pay the lower fine to the state.
However, the board agreed to give former Central Falls mayoral hopeful Hipolito Fontes more time to pay the $5,109 he owed from missing campaign finance reports dating back to 2010. Fontes, who also came to the board’s Cranston office Wednesday, explained the series of unfortunate events that led to his original, $233,000 fine: a heated mayoral race that included personal threats, the closure of the Central Falls credit union where he opened his campaign account, and a divorce.
“I want to take accountability,” Fontes told the board. “After hitting brick wall after brick wall, I gave up at some point.” 
Fontes lost his job at Oak Street Health this summer, which he told the elections board would make it hard to repay even a reduced fine in 90 days. Based on Fontes’ explanation, the board agreed to double the time he has to pay to 180 days. 
Little solace to Fontes.
“I’ve been honestly just freaking out about it,” he said in an interview Thursday. “I have a mortgage to try to figure out. I get unemployment so I am trying to stitch things together but I am trying to figure out how I am going to come up with $900 a month extra.”
Fontes also questioned the fairness of the process. His new fine is still more than double the $2,500 that Thornton estimated was spent on postage and labor over the last 25 years.
“I wanted to make things whole based on the postage they spent,” Fontes said. “But it feels like a little bit of a sham. This is more than a mortgage payment.”
A case-by-case basis
But, it’s 75% less than the $20,000 that Daryl Gould, a former candidate for state representative and Bristol School Committee, will have to pay. Gould did not appear at the meeting Wednesday and did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. However, Gould’s relationship with the elections panel has been fraught for several years. 
In 2022, he was held in contempt by the elections board, and issued $3,000 in fines, for failing to submit his missing reports. His case was referred to the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office later that same year, but the state’s top prosecutor declined to take action, Thornton said. His fines and late fees topped $134,000 before the board agreed to the lesser, $20,000 balance Wednesday.
The new regulations governing campaign finance fines rely partly on formulas based on the type of offense, but also offer discretion. Contentious cases like Gould’s offer grounds for a larger fine in Thornton’s eyes. So too did the cases in which candidates raised or spent significant amounts of money, and for those who actually won elected office.
Take, for example, former state Sen. Patrick T. McDonald, who served eight years on Smith Hill, from 1996 to 2002. 
“He was an officeholder in the past, so he knew what the campaign finance requirements are,” Thornton said.
The Narragansett Democrat filed the reports on fundraising and spending through his time in office, but he never closed his campaign finance account. His $737,900 worth of  fines and late fees was the most of any candidate or campaign. 
But now, McDonald owes just under $19,000, approved by the elections board at its Sept. 9 meeting. He has not paid as of Thursday, and has not responded to any attempts at contact over the last 23 years, Thornton said.
McDonald also served a 4.5-year prison sentence after he was convicted in 2014 of embezzling money from his law practice. McDonald did not return a call for comment Thursday. 
Other former candidates whose fines have been reduced are:

Robert Rainville, a 2010 attorney general candidate, whose fine was reduced from more than $310,000 to $17,800 on Sept. 9. A phone number for Rainville was not available, but he did not return a message sent on LinkedIn Thursday.
James Black Jr., a 2010 North Providence Town Council candidate, whose fine was reduced from $310,000 to $9,500 on Sept. 9. Black did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Emily Trott, a West Warwick Town Council candidate in 2008, 2010 and 2012, whose fine was reduced from $235,600 to $8,500 on Oct. 8. Trott attended the elections board’s Oct. 9 meeting and accepted responsibility for the missing reports, blaming it on procrastination.
John McMahon, a 2016 Portsmouth Town Council candidate, whose fine was reduced from over $140,000 to $6,000 on Oct. 8.
Jeffrey Appiah, a 2018 Pawtucket City Council candidate, whose fine was reduced from more than $72,700 to $3,000 on Oct. 8.
David Santilli Jr., a 2018 Johnston Town Council candidate, whose fine was reduced from $21,500 to $1,7500 on Oct. 8.

(Photos courtesy campaigns)The race to represent House District 73, which comprises much of Chesterfield County, represents a litmus test for shifting demographics and partisan tides, and may show which issues motivate Virginia voters beyond party affiliation. 
Incumbent Republican Mark Earley Jr. is a lawyer and a first-term delegate who will defend his seat against Democratic challenger Leslie Mehta, who is hoping to make her debut in the House. Neither are strangers to politics, however.  
Earley, a lawyer, is the son of former Republican state Attorney General Mark Earley Sr. The younger Earley was first elected in 2023 and previously served in former Gov. Bob McDonnell’s administration. 
Mehta, a lawyer who was the former legal director for Virginia’s American Civil Liberties Union chapter, was appointed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to serve on the Rare Disease Council and previously posed an unsuccessful challenge to U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, for the 1st Congressional District. 
This means it’s also not Mehta’s first time taking on a Republican in a district that could be a challenge to flip. She’s feeling confident, she told The Mercury in a recent interview, as she plans to be “part of the conversation” in addressing federal funding fallout if elected. And there’s one aspect that might give her an edge: House District 73 is a little more favorable to Democrats than the 1st Congressional District was. 
The district leans Republican but an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project shows Democrat Kamala Harris beat Republican President Donald Trump by .6% of a point there last November. Republican margins for statewide or national elections in the district have shrunk in recent years, in part from redistricting. The locality has also evolved over the years as it has expanded in population growth and partisan demographics.

 Leslie Mehta

Mehta’s campaign came out of the gate with an endorsement from Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger.  Spanberger was one of the most bipartisan members of Congress before her gubernatorial bid, and Mehta  said she also plans to legislate in that fashion. 
Describing herself as a “pragmatist” who will work across the aisle to get things done, she emphasized that if elected, her Democratic colleagues will count on her to help advance three in-progress constitutional amendments. The Democrat-led proposals would protect reproductive health care access in the state’s constitution, automatically restore voting rights to people who complete felony sentences and remove a prohibition on same-sex marriage.
Amid passionate debate, civil rights resolutions clear Virginia legislature

As Mehta has struggled with fertility issues and chronic pain due to endometriosis, in vitro fertilization is how she was able to conceive and she has since had a hysterectomy. She emphasized how the amendment applies to multiple reproductive health decisions, including abortions. 
“There’s so much shame sometimes that’s centered around not only the things that happen to our bodies, but the decisions that we make,” she said.
Some of Mehta’s key priorities include exploring tax reform so that higher-income earners pay “their fair share,” and finding ways to ease burdens on middle-class or working families. Her ideas include reforming property and car taxes; eliminating the car tax is a goal of both Spanberger and Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, though it has failed in past governors’ terms. 
Like many Democrats, Mehta aims to invest more state money in public education. Bolstering funding also appears to be a goal of Earley’s, though The Mercury was unable to ask for more details as he did not respond to multiple interview requests. 
Mehta also believes her passion for health care policy can help appeal to voters. 
When campaigning for Congress last year, she said health care affordability and access were  concerns she heard repeatedly while door-knocking. The issues have remained salient as Congress’ reconciliation bill that passed this summer will alter hospital funding mechanisms and likely cause thousands of Virginians and millions of Americans to lose Medicaid coverage. 
A chorus of Democratic lawmakers, hospital officials, and health care advocates have warned that the forthcoming changes from the reconciliation bill will likely cause hospitals to trim services — with some vulnerable to closures — while those without insurance who put off care can face more dire outcomes and higher costs others will absorb. 
“We just cannot put these kinds of constraints on Virginians or health care professionals,” Mehta said. “We’re going to have to figure out ways to make it better. So I want to be part of that conversation.” 
Medicaid is personal to her, as it helped improve the life of her oldest daughter Brooke, who suffered a rare, debilitating genetic disorder before her death. Brooke needed a specialized stroller for mobility and eventually an eye-gaze device allowed her to communicate words without speaking. 
“As a first time mom, I got to hear the words ‘I love you, Mommy’ because of Medicaid,” Mehta explained. 
Though she and her husband have private insurance, Brooke’s status as someone with a disability helped them offset a variety of her living expenses and gave the two-time Democratic candidate deeper insight into how critical the program is to many Virginians. 
 Mark Earley, Jr. 

Health care is also a priority for Earley, though it’s unclear what his exact plans are because he could not be reached to share more details. 
His campaign website states that “easier access, better quality and far more transparency” can be “achieved through a market driven approach that drives down cost.”
He added that “mental health and addiction must also be top priorities.”
The state legislature and Gov. Glenn Youngkin have  been tackling those issues by bolstering crisis response, creating online resource hubs and promoting crisis hotlines. 
Earley’s passion for those issues also stem from his experience as a foster parent and work as an attorney, he’s said. 
A member of the minority party during his tenure in the legislature so far, Earley has not passed any legislation, nor did any  of his 15 bills filed this year make it  out of the House. 
Though he hasn’t been able to advance his ideas, his party has depended on him to help vote down key Democratic-led proposals.
Of the three in-progress constitutional amendments that need to pass a second time before voters can weigh in next year, two cleared on a bipartisan basis, while one — the reproductive rights measure — now hinges on Democrats retaining their majority in the House. 
While every Republican in the state legislature voted against the proposal to enshrine reproductive rights into Virginia’s constitution, Earley also strongly opposed it when he spoke out on the House floor in January. 
There, he alleged the amendment “obliterates” parental rights and called it “among the most extreme and ideologically-driven amendments that have been proposed in the nation.”
Democrats countered that state law already outlines parental consent for minors to have surgeries, like abortions. Still, the matter has remained a concern for Republicans. 
Like many in his party, Earley’s other priorities include “empowering parents” and allowing them more say in  K-12 public education. He also supports excluding transgender students from “girl’s and women’s sports and spaces,” a goal Virginia has moved towards achieving this year.  
Earley said he has prioritized supporting families overall as a delegate and will continue to do so if reelected. As a parent of two who fostered six children,  he’s also passionate about supporting foster families.
Speaking to the camera in a video he posted to his website, he threaded various action items together including boosting parents’ rights, lowering the cost of health care and lowering taxes among others. 
“This is where my mind is, and it’s where my effort will be: to support and protect the Virginia family,” he said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Rhode Island’s Medicaid program is contemplating an end to coverage for GLP-1 drugs prescribed for weight loss.
The proposal appears in the Rhode Island’s Executive Office of Health and Human Services’ 270-page operating budget submission for fiscal year 2027. The coverage change could take effect as early as July 1, 2026, but would more likely happen by October 2026 or January 2027, according to the budget request document — one of the many documents state agencies send to the governor’s office each fall with details on their monetary needs and challenges predicted in the upcoming fiscal year.
“While quite efficacious, these medications are quite expensive, with list prices ranging from $12,000 annually to roughly $16,000 annually as of March 2025,” the budget proposal reads.
The department’s proposal would only affect prescriptions for weight loss, and it would still cover prescriptions for diabetes, which the GLP-1 drugs were first used to treat. GLP-1 drugs work on type-2 diabetes by suppressing glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar. The same mechanism plays a role in how the body feels hunger, which is why the drugs are valuable in weight loss. 
The drugs are nearly chemically identical regardless of the condition they treat, and some drugs contain the same active ingredients but are marketed under different names. Novo Nordisk, for instance, markets two versions: Ozempic for diabetes, and Wegovy for weight loss. Other branded drugs in the GLP-1 family include Trulicity, Mounjaro and Zepbound. 
Regardless of branding, the drugs share a high price point as well, and are expected to get even pricier. The department estimates it could save $6.3 million in general revenue, and $20.3 million across all funding sources, including federal ones. 
The savings would be procured by tweaking contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs), the insurers who deliver most of the state’s Medicaid coverage.
“GLP-1 weight loss costs are expected to increase again between approximately 130 percent (low estimate) and nearly 200 percent (high estimate),” by the end of the second quarter in fiscal year 2027, according to the department’s budget request.
Between the start of fiscal year 2024 and the end of fiscal year 2025, GLP-1 costs roughly quadrupled in Rhode Island Medicaid’s per-member monthly payments to its managed care plans, according to the department.
That data aligns with what the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner reported in May about the drugs’ impact on the commercial insurance market. A record 7.8% in spending growth in 2023 across Rhode Island’s health system was partially driven by a surging amount of GLP-1 prescriptions, which doubled from 2022 to 2023. Total commercial health plan spending on the drug class more than tripled from 2021 to 2023. 
Health and Human Service’s budget note does, however, provide a caveat about its analysis of fiscal impact, which is based on a short-term calculation tied directly to changes in managed care rates. 
“Ending coverage for GLP-1 obesity drugs would be in line with current financial trends in both public and private insurance companies but could result in health inequities and less comprehensive coverage for a large segment of Rhode Island’s population,” the budget note reads.
Obesity is more prevalent among low-income Rhode Islanders and communities of color. Among adults, 38.5% of Black residents have obesity, compared with 33.9% of Hispanic residents and 29.5% of white residents, according to Health in Rhode Island. 
Income disparities are similar, with 44.6% of adults in households earning under $15,000 diagnosed as obese. Obesity is found in 35.5% of adults in households earning $15,000–$25,000.
Nationally, state Medicaid outfits are restricting GLP-1 coverage as list prices consistently climb alongside increasing demand. The EOHHS note adds that 14 states cover GLP-1s, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire. 
But even these states may soon change their minds. Connecticut wants to roll back coverage, and Massachusetts’ MassHealth now limits weight-loss coverage to Zepbound with prior authorization. Patients must also take a trial of phentermine, an older drug chemically related to amphetamines and still widely used for weight loss, before they can be approved for GLP-1s.
The Health and Human Services budget document notes that the GLP-1 coverage chaos comes after the outgoing Biden administration left the specifics of the drugs’ eligibility under Medicare and Medicaid up to the Trump administration. In April 2025, President Donald Trump’s administration declined to expand Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans to cover GLP-1s for weight-loss.

This is happening to all of us: […]","Maine People's Alliance volunteers with signs at the B Street Health Center in Lewiston, including Jim Lysen, the former executive director Community Clinical Services, which operates the clinic. (Photo courtesy of Maine People's Alliance.)As the federal government shutdown entered its ninth day with no end in sight, advocacy groups and the Maine Democratic Party are criticizing Republican U.S. Sen Susan Collins while raising concerns about what they see as an urgent need to address rising health care costs.
“This is real. This is happening to all of us: middle income, working class individuals,” said Maine Rep. Anne Graham (D-North Yarmouth), a retired pediatric nurse practitioner who spoke at a press conference Thursday alongside other party leaders who warned that tens of thousands of Mainers will face skyrocketing insurance premiums if Congress does not take immediate action. 
“This is going to hurt us all, and Susan Collins has let us down consistently,” Graham said.
That issue is at the heart of the shutdown, with congressional Democrats asking for a short-term funding plan that also extends tax credits that lower the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans, including Collins, are refusing to include that subsidy in the stopgap bill needed to reopen government. 
Sen. Collins said Democrats’ health care demands will ‘prolong shutdown’

Collins said on Monday that she supports extending the expiring tax credits, with some reforms, but doesn’t think that should be part of the “clean stopgap funding” that she prefers.
Collins, as well as independent U.S. Sen. Angus King, have voted repeatedly since the shutdown began on Oct. 1 in favor of the Republican bill that would fund the government for seven weeks without any of the health care provisions requested by Democrats. King has also supported a Democratic proposal that includes the health care provisions. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Maine 2nd District Rep. Jared Golden was the only Democrat to back the Republican plan. 
Devon Murphy-Anderson, executive director of the Maine Democratic Party, highlighted the financial strain that Mainers are already facing and accused Collins and her Republican colleagues of exacerbating the crisis by failing to extend the tax credits. 
Of the 61,000 Mainers who enroll through CoverME.gov, the state’s online marketplace, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs. If they expire, some families could see their premiums increase by as much as 117%, with some paying over $900 more per month, the administration of Gov. Janet Mills has warned.
Maine Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), who chairs the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, echoed these concerns, emphasizing that the loss of tax credits would disproportionately impact working families, small businesses, and rural communities. People in Aroostook and Washington counties are facing premiums increases over 70%, he said. Across the board, Mainers will need to come up with $88 million a year to absorb these costs, Gattine added.
During the event, Graham shared examples of Maine families who would be devastated by the loss of tax credits, including a Fort Kent couple in their 60s whose premiums would jump from $7,200 to $25,000 a year. 
She said she has reached out to Collins directly about the pressing need to act on these health care issues. Graham said the senator “appears to be responsive, but then votes against all the things that we really care about in the state of Maine.”

A bipartisan issue
Megan Smith, a community organizer for Maine People’s Alliance, a statewide progressive community action organization, joined volunteers outside the Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor on Wednesday to speak with patients about concerns they have with the impending cost increases. 
In rural Maine, where hospitals are struggling, Smith said she heard from several people who are already waiting up to six months for appointments with specialists.  
“If these offices close, these hospitals close, that means these people are going to have to drive hours for health care,” she said. “Losing the subsidies for the ACA is really scary to a lot of people, and even people who have insurance through their employers are scared that their rates are going to go up, as well.”
When Smith was a small business owner, she relied on marketplace health insurance herself, she said. 
“Those subsidies helped me for many, many years. And it just breaks my heart to even consider people not having access to that.”
Jim Lysen, the former executive director of Community Clinical Services, which operates the B-Street Health Center in Lewiston, canvassed outside its entrance on Wednesday, trying to learn how patients may be impacted by the expiring tax credits as well as pending cuts to MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program.
“The system that I helped create is undone by MaineCare cuts,” he said. “You’re wiping out a lot of people’s access to health care who won’t be able to afford it.”
He said in his decades-long career, he had never seen such an acute attack on health care, especially impacting low and middle income people.
“It’s unprecedented,” he said. “I’ve never seen it this bad.”
Lysen, who volunteers for Maine People’s Alliance, said health care should be a bipartisan issue because hospitals serve people across the political spectrum.
“Hospitals closing in rural areas is a bipartisan issue, it’s not just a progressive issue,” he said. “Because these hospitals in Maine serve lots of Republicans. So this is really a problem for all Mainers.”

(Photo courtesy Bryan Watts)Conservationists have been sounding the alarm for years over the lackluster breeding seasons for osprey along the Chesapeake Bay, and debate continues about why. A new study from the Center for Conservation Biology at the College of William & Mary shows  broods that nest in areas of the Bay that rely mostly on Atlantic menhaden are more likely to starve to death just weeks after hatching.
Researchers point to populations of  menhaden, a small forage fish, not being large enough to feed the chicks and the fish entering the Bay later in the breeding season as possible reasons for the starving birds There have been signs of osprey populations struggling to breed for years, and challenges for other species that rely on the menhaden. A study about menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay specifically has been unable to get off the ground in the state legislature.
Virginia fishermen call on President Trump to protect menhaden in Chesapeake Bay

The William & Mary study examined salinity levels in certain areas of the Chesapeake Bay and how they relate to the kind of fish the osprey are preying on to survive. Researcher Bryan Watts used that data to categorize the osprey populations  by where they nest and what fish they will likely depend on.
“Once you get to the lower salinity water, for example, the upper James (River), you wouldn’t expect menhaden to be there,” Watts said. “The ospreys in that part of the river depend primarily on catfish and gizzard chad, so they don’t feed on menhaden there.”
The 2025 breeding season, which stretches from March to August, experienced major weather events that impacted the nesting. 
The research shows that in low salinity areas, such as near the upper James, Potomac, and Rappahannock Rivers, there were more successful osprey broods that were closer to the targets  needed to sustain the population. Conversely, the osprey that nested in the higher salinity areas, which would largely rely on menhaden for food, saw more chicks dying of starvation.
Watts and his team expanded their research area for the 2025 study to include more than 1000 nests over 23 locations. None of the nests in the 18 high-salinity areas produced enough chicks to sustain the osprey population in their part of the Bay. Nests in the low- salinity areas performed better, but still faced challenges.

“I think there’s a general agreement that there’s not enough menhaden currently in the Bay to support a stable osprey population. The real question at this point and the real controversy is why are there not enough fish? You know, what’s caused the change?” Watts said.
Osprey are not the only species impacted by the menhaden availability. There are other birds, larger fish, and marine mammals that need the fish to survive. But ospreys have been the more visible canary in the coal mine, showing the need to address food scarcity in the Chesapeake Bay.
It’s unclear why the menhaden populations may not be enough to feed other animals, as there has not been a state-funded study to specifically look at the menhaden in the bay, despite multiple efforts in the General Assembly to do so. 
Virginia’s menhaden population and management remains a heated topic, and the new William & Mary study does not directly blame the lack of menhaden on over-fishing. Omega Protein, the only reduction fishery allowed in the Chesapeake Bay off the shores of Virginia, has been blamed for the reportedly declining menhaden populations. Omega Protein contracts through Ocean Harvesters. Groups including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association say the company’s operations have decimated the presence of the forage fish in the Bay. 
Ocean Harvesters stated that they did not enter the Chesapeake Bay in 2025 to start their fishing of the menhaden until late May, which is later than usual. They claim that period of activity does not line up with when the chicks were hatching.
“Center for Conservation Biology’s 2025 advisory shows food stress signals in higher-salinity waters, but the timing and the text do not support (the Chesapeake Bay Foundation)’s misleading narrative that the regulated menhaden fishery caused this year’s early nest failures and first-weeks chick mortalities,” Ocean Harvesters said in a release. “Those events occurred before the season opened and menhaden boats were still at the dock.”
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation said a group of organizations will release a stock assessment on the menhaden populations later this month to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, but it will be for the entire East Coast rather than just inside the Chesapeake Bay. The group continues to push for funding on that kind of study, which is projected to take three years to conduct.
“We keep being delayed by the industry who says there’s no problem, but, harvest, you know, millions and millions of pounds of these fish. So that is obviously something that I think is frustrating to everyone,” said Chris Moore, the Virginia Executive Director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
Both groups agree that all factors, including climate impacts, need to be considered when determining what is happening to the menhaden populations thus affecting the osprey and other species. 
There have been recent efforts to curb the reduction fishery’s activities in the Bay, with some Virginia fishermen calling on President Donald Trump to sign an executive order halting Omega’s fishing. While no such order has come down, state lawmakers are mulling over possible legislation to propose in the next General Assembly session to fund a study or other measures. 
The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has also considered recommendations to spread out menhaden fishing caps throughout the year to help the fish move through the Bay at critical times, but has not taken steps to make those changes.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Key federal funding for New Hampshire schools has not been affected by the shutdown in Washington, Department of Education Commissioner Caitlin Davis said Thursday — at least the money that flows through the state Department of Education. 
That’s because the federal money for the coming school year was “forward-funded,” meaning it was given to the state department in July in advance of the current school year, Davis said. 
“We have the majority of our federal education programming funds for the full year,” Davis told members of the State Board of Education at its monthly meeting Thursday. “So we’re lucky that doesn’t impact us that much.”
The pre-allocated money includes $50 million in Title I-A grants, which pass through the state agency and on to public schools with significant populations of low-income students. 
It also includes funds for Title II-A, which supports efforts to train teachers and improve their effectiveness to raise student academic achievement, as well as Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds, which cover a portion of public schools’ special education expenses.  
In total, about $200 million in annual allocations from the U.S. Department of Education will not be affected by the shutdown, Davis said.
But assistance programs run by other agencies may be in more jeopardy. For instance, money for free and reduced-price meals from the U.S. Department of Agriculture has not been granted to New Hampshire in one lump sum, Davis said, and thus could run out. “We do have some advanced money,” Davis said, speaking on the meals program. 
And other funding programs that affect public schools but are not run through the Department of Education, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, could also be hurt by the shutdown, she said.
SNAP has not yet been affected by the shutdown because benefits for the state are covered through October; Medicaid also has sufficient funds to continue operating through the first quarter of the 2026 federal fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
The shutdown, which began after U.S. Senate Democrats refused to vote with Republicans to continue government funding in order to obtain assurances that health care subsidies will continue, entered its 10th day Friday. It has led to widespread furloughs of federal workers, including some at the Portsmouth Naval shipyard, and has forced some federal employees, such as air traffic controllers, to continue work without pay. 
In a Sept. 30 press release shortly before the expected shutdown, Gov. Kelly Ayotte asserted that most state operations would not be affected and predicted “minimal impact,” at least for the first 30 days.
Davis echoed that point Thursday, noting that the front-loaded money means that all 275 positions at the state education department will continue to be paid, even though some rely on federal funds.
“We are continuing to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis and provide updates to both schools and department employees, because it can provide some unrest, as you can imagine,” Davis said.
“People hear the federal employees are not working in this time, and (ask) how does that impact our work?”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7294186-Caitlin-Davis-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-10 05:56:16.556752

Even as the federal government attempts to prop up the waning coal industry, New England’s last coal-fired power plant has ceased operations three years ahead of its planned retirement date. The closure of the New Hampshire facility paves the way for its owner to press ahead with an initiative to transform the site into a clean energy complex including solar panels and battery storage systems.











“The end of coal is real, and it is here,” said Catherine Corkery, chapter director for Sierra Club New Hampshire. ​“We’re really excited about the next chapter.”


News of the closure came on the same day the Trump administration announced plans to resuscitate the coal sector by opening millions of acres of federal land to mining operations and investing $625 million in life-extending upgrades for coal plants. The administration had already released a blueprint for rolling back coal-related environmental regulations.


The announcement was the latest offensive in the administration’s pro-coal agenda. The federal government has twice extended the scheduled closure date of the coal-burning J.H. Campbell plant in Michigan, and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has declared it a mission of the administration to keep coal plants open, saying the facilities are needed to ensure grid reliability and lower prices.


However, the closure in New Hampshire — so far undisputed by the federal government — demonstrates that prolonging operations at some facilities just doesn’t make economic sense for their owners.


“Coal has been incredibly challenged in the New England market for over a decade,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.


Merrimack Station, a 438-megawatt power plant, came online in the 1960s and provided baseload power to the New England region for decades. Gradually, though, natural gas — which is cheaper and more efficient — took over the regional market. In 2000, gas-fired plants generated less than 15% of the region’s electricity; last year, they produced more than half.







Additionally, solar power production accelerated from 2010 on, lowering demand on the grid during the day and creating more evening peaks. Coal plants take longer to ramp up production than other sources, and are therefore less economical for these shorter bursts of demand, Dolan said.














In recent years, Merrimack operated only a few weeks annually. In 2024, the plant generated just 0.22% of the region’s electricity. It wasn’t making enough money to justify continued operations, observers said.


The closure ​“is emblematic of the transition that has been occurring in the generation fleet in New England for many years,” Dolan said. ​“The combination of all those factors has meant that coal facilities are no longer economic in this market.”


Granite Shore Power, the plant’s owner, first announced its intention to shutter Merrimack in March 2024, following years of protests and legal wrangling by environmental advocates. The company pledged to cease coal-fired operations by 2028 to settle a lawsuit claiming that the facility was in violation of the federal Clean Water Act. The agreement included another commitment to shut down the company’s Schiller plant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, by the end of 2025; this smaller plant can burn coal but hasn’t done so since 2020.


At the time, the company outlined a proposal to repurpose the 400-acre Merrimack site, just outside Concord, for clean energy projects, taking advantage of existing electric infrastructure to connect a 120-megawatt combined solar and battery storage system to the grid.


It is not yet clear whether changes in federal renewable energy policies will affect this vision. In a statement announcing the Merrimack closure, Granite Shore Power was less specific about its plans than it had been, saying, ​“We continue to consider all opportunities for redevelopment” of the site, but declining to follow up with more detail.


Still, advocates are looking ahead with optimism.
“This is progress — there’s no doubt the math is there,” Corkery said. ​“It is never over until it is over, but I am very hopeful.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bowmerrimack-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-10-10 05:56:16.556752

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio House lawmakers approved a pair of property tax measures Wednesday. The bills would give little known county boards greater oversight powers and get into the weeds of Ohio’s byzantine system for classifying taxes and calculating reductions.
At a moment when many Ohioans are frustrated enough to put property tax abolition to a vote, the proposals offer a series of changes likely to bring down property taxes in the short term and rein in future increases.
But the question is whether voters will recognize improvements if they happen. All the changes happen under the hood, indirect tweaks to processes that most taxpayers struggle to understand.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After the measures passed committee, the bills’ sponsor, state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, said it was “probably the most impactful committee in several decades on property tax reform.” Still, he admitted lawmakers are still in a difficult spot.
“We are definitely behind what’s happened with taxpayers,” he said. “And we’re just trying to show them give us more time, which is a horrible thing to say to those that are struggling, but that’s really where we’re kind of at.”
“We’re passing these bills — most consequential in decades — and we’re trying to show that things will change, things will get better, and we’re not walking away from this,” he added.
House Speaker Matt Huffman acknowledged that property taxes are obscure to many Ohioans, but lawmakers are trying to simplify the system.
“Part of what we are doing today is to open the black box and shine a light on it,” he said.
As for the proposed amendment abolishing property taxes, the speaker thinks about 40% of voters are a hard ‘yes’ and another 40% are a hard ‘no.’
“As in many elections, it’s the last 10 or 15% who actually make the decision,” he said. “I think that group of voters is going to make their decision based on the things that we do over the next six or seven weeks here.”
County budget commissions
State law gives the treasurer, auditor and prosecutor in each of Ohio’s counties significant oversight for local levies. In the most recent state budget, lawmakers gave these County Budget Commissions the authority to rollback “unnecessary” or “excessive” levies. Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the provision — zeroing in on the possibility of commissions undoing levies approved just months before by the voters.
In committee, Rep. Thomas proposed an amendment to House Bill 309 adopting suggestions from the governor’s property tax working group. The changes included a five-year safe harbor for new levies and explicit definitions for “unnecessary” and “excessive.”
“The goal of these three were to help give some of the, I guess, guardrails that were requested by local entities and by members for the budget commissions,” Thomas explained.
State Rep. Daniel Troy, D-Willowick, complained the governor’s working group also recommended a two-year safe harbor for renewal levies, but that provision didn’t make it into the amendment. Still, he supported the measure.
Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan, who served on the governor’s working group, praised the committee for adopting the changes. He argued the county budget commission is an important check on rising levies, and because they’re all elected officials there’s accountability for its actions.
“If we make the wrong decision, if we defund a popular entity like (developmental disabilities boards) to the point that they lose money (and) that hurts services, we’re up for election — they are not. And so, we have to make the right decisions, or our voters will tell us,” he said.
On the House floor, though, state Rep. Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, argued that’s not good enough.
“Politicians should not override the will of voters,” she insisted, adding, “I think that we should allow the voters to have the final say.”
When he got a chance to speak, Rep. Thomas argued when voters approve a levy they’re approving a service — not a number.
“If the government can actually do that service for less, and doesn’t need that full tax amount, it’s in everyone’s interest to decrease those rates,” he said.
In several counties, Thomas said, local officials are reducing levies voluntarily, but the bill makes it clear all counties can do so. state can’t rely on voluntary action.
“It takes off the handcuffs,” he said. “Will this be used in every county? No, I can’t tell you that your budget commission in all 88 counties will be as aggressive for the taxpayer, as what I believe they should be.”
But we are recertifying, in black and white stone, that the budget commission has this ability.”
House Bill 309 passed 75-19.
What counts toward the 20-mill floor?
For decades, Ohio has given homeowners a property tax reduction to hold their bills steady as property values rise.
The idea is to block so-called “unvoted” property tax increases. Voters approved a given amount of money at the ballot, the argument goes, and so the taxing authority shouldn’t get more money just because property values have gone up.
To avoid increases, counties regularly reduce property tax rates so that more valuable property yields the same tax revenue.
The problem is school districts can’t reduce millage below 20 mills (or 2%). If property values rise high enough, those reductions stop working because they run into that hard stop at 20 mills. Two income sources, fixed sum levies and income taxes, aren’t calculated toward that 20-mill floor, though.
Ohio House Bill 129 would include them. Thomas explained 237 school districts, or roughly 1/3 of those in the state, voted for levies that aren’t currently counted toward the floor.
“And so, what we’re saying is, moving forward, those 237 schools will not be at the 20-mill floor,” he said, “and therefore will not spike as our values continue to increase.”
Reclassifying levies creates slack in the system — effectively lifting those districts off the 20-mill floor and making room for additional reductions.
Lawmakers recently overrode the governor’s budget veto to eliminate emergency and substitute levies. But in doing so they undid a set of state credits that go along with them. Democrats have warned those credits amount to almost $100 million around the state.
State Rep. Chris Glassburn, D-North Olmstead, thanked Republicans for delaying the impact of that change through a last minute amendment, but insisted “that 100-million-dollar mistake is being punted to five years from now.”
“This is not the property tax relief that our residents are asking for,” he said. “This is one of several technical changes that we’re trying to do to make the system right in the future, but this is not going to change the vast majority of Ohioans’ bills, and to the extent that it helps people, it is to prevent damage we caused in that override.”
Thomas acknowledged the measure is not the “be all, end all” of property tax reform, but said “for 237 of our school districts, for 1/3 of Ohioans, this bill gets us to a much better place.”
The bill passed easily, 81-16.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderAs the government shutdown drags into its second week, Georgia’s congressional delegation is locked in a partisan struggle over who is to blame, with one of the state’s most high-profile Republicans, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, seemingly charting her own political path by challenging both parties on the issue of rising health care costs.
Greene, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, broke with her party’s leadership and declared, “I’m carving my own lane” in an online post this week. She said she would go “against everyone on this issue” because the premium hikes would impact “my own adult children” and her constituents in northwest Georgia.
She criticized the Republican-controlled Congress for prioritizing “foreign countries and foreign wars” over domestic health care affordability concerns.
At the core of the dispute in Washington is the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which would significantly increase health insurance costs for Georgians if allowed to expire at the end of the year. According to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis, a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 per year would see their monthly premium more than triple.
While Greene provided a rare moment of agreement with Democrats — “I never thought I’d say this, but Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is right,” Sen. Raphael Warnock posted online Tuesday — she offered no clear legislative solution, maintaining a deep ideological opposition to the program itself. Greene called the ACA a “disaster” and the insurance industry a “scam.”
Greene said she was “absolutely disgusted” by the lack of a Republican plan to prevent the doubling of health insurance premiums for Americans.

Natalie Crawford, executive director of Georgia First, a nonprofit think tank and policy advocacy group, said in an interview that she is hopeful more members of Georgia’s congressional delegation will come to understand how “uniquely bad the situation is for Georgia.” 
The loss of these credits, she said, would result in the collapse of the state-based marketplace, an “explosion” of the already “very large uninsured rate,” and an expansion of the coverage gap for residents who earn too much for Medicaid but too little to afford market policies.
“Those are populations that are going to be greatly affected. It’s going to have very real fiscal impact for the state of Georgia,” Crawford said. “And I think that the more our delegation understands that and is able to speak to that, there potentially is some hope for negotiation.” 
Crawford said the lack of a viable alternative means the state of Georgia would be left to consider its own tax credits or to “revisit expansion” to cover those expected to lose coverage if the federal tax credits expire. Georgia is one of 10 states that have not fully expanded Medicaid. 
“This is not a partisan issue. It should not be a partisan issue, and I understand policy differences, but at the end of the day, healthy Georgians are productive Georgians, and if we continue making policy choices that favor a lack of coverage or don’t do anything to improve coverage, and accessibility and affordability, then what we understand is going to happen is that we have a less healthy workforce, and ultimately that will lead to a less healthy Georgia economy,” Crawford said.
‘This is not a health care fight’
Greene stands out for her willingness to talk about the expiring health care subsidies. Her Georgia Republican colleagues have instead focused on ramping up pressure on Democrats to support the GOP spending plan. 
Georgia Republicans sent a letter to Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff this week demanding they “set aside partisan politics” and “join us in reopening the government.” They accused Senate Democrats of refusing to pass a “clean, continuing resolution” that the House has already approved and of holding Georgia families and farmers hostage.
Congressman Mike Collins. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Rep. Mike Collins, a U.S. Senate candidate speaking Tuesday at a Georgia Republican event in Cumming, insisted that the debate is “not about a health care fight” but solely about passing a “clean CR” to fund the government, arguing that if Democrats want to argue about health care, they can “bring that up on its own.”
“This is not a health care fight. That’s not where you have this fight. Right now, this is a funding bill. Simple,” he said.
Rep. Austin Scott said in a statement Thursday that “the Democrat argument to shut the government down over ACA subsidies is nothing more than an excuse,” and pointed to funding bills House Republicans passed in September that he argued would keep the government open until November while negotiations continue.
“They knew well over a month ago they were going to shut the government down to try and teach President Trump a lesson. The bottom line is they hate Trump more than they care about the American people,” Scott said.
‘We’re not bending the knee’
Democrats, meanwhile, are unified in blaming the Republican leadership for creating the crisis. Rep. Hank Johnson, led the Georgia Democratic delegation in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, urging him to call the House back to Washington “to engage in good-faith bipartisan efforts to address these issues.”
“Our constituents get up each morning and come to work. With Georgians’ health care on the line and government funding expired, they expect the same from the Members of Congress who represent them,” he wrote to Johnson.

Rep. Lucy McBath, speaking at a press conference in Atlanta Thursday, insisted the shutdown is “not a government shutdown of our making,” but because Republicans refuse to negotiate.
“We have wanted a bipartisan funding bill. We’ve been waiting, trying to get the Republicans to come to the table to negotiate, but they refuse. What they have given us is a take it or leave it,” McBath said.
McBath rejected the view that health care is a secondary issue in the government funding debate, a position some of her Republican colleagues, like Collins, have taken. She added that the issue is central to the nation’s economy, arguing that if people are not healthy, they cannot work, and “if they can’t work, they’re not a vital part of this economy.” 
She said Democrats are ready to “stand (their) ground.”
“I cannot predict how long this will last, but we have to stand our ground to make sure that we are doing everything that we can to give as much information and prepare people as to what is about to happen with the expiration of these tax credits. We’re not bending the knee, and we’re not kissing the ring,” she said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC0946-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 05:56:16.556752

(Photo courtesy of OSF Healthcare) The federal government shutdown is forcing a reckoning for two remote health care programs because they automatically expired Oct. 1.
The telehealth and in-home hospital care programs were both temporary — but increasingly popular — options for Medicare recipients. They allowed doctors and hospitals to bill Medicare for telehealth appointments and in-home visits from nurses to provide care that is generally only available in hospitals.
The shutdown has prevented Congress from extending them.
More than 4 million Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth services in the first half of the year, according to Brown University’s Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research.
As of last fall, 366 hospitals had participated in the hospital-at-home program, serving 31,000 patients, according to a federal report. The program, officially called Acute Hospital Care at Home, allows patients who would otherwise be hospitalized to get inpatient care at home with a combination of nurse visits, monitoring equipment and remote doctor visits.
The programs have their roots in the pandemic, when doctors and hospitals wanted to keep patients safe from the risks of travel and hospital stays. Both are for Medicare recipients, generally people over 65 or who are disabled. But since many private insurers follow federal guidelines, some physicians have stopped booking telemedicine appointments for non-Medicare patients, rather than risk a change in insurance coverage.
Alexis Wynn, who is in her mid-30s and covered by private insurance through her employer, tried to switch an in-person doctor appointment in Pennsylvania to a video visit last week. The office told her that “all telemedicine is uncovered by insurance as of Oct. 1” — so she had to cancel the routine appointment.
“It was just a follow-up appointment  to make sure the dosing of my medication was still accurate, nothing that was pertinent to being face-to-face,” Wynn said. Her health insurance company later told her it still covered telehealth visits.
There have been other reports of insurers turning down non-Medicare telehealth appointments, said Alexis Apple, director of federal affairs for the American Telemedicine Association, a trade group.
“It’s a misunderstanding,” Apple said. “I’m not really sure what’s happening, but it’s unfortunate and very scary. There’s so much uncertainty out there now, and we see insurance payers start to pull back.”

Both telehealth and home hospital services can be a lifeline for older people, especially in rural areas, where residents may struggle to travel long distances for health care in person.
“In rural America, it’s often telemedicine or no medicine at all,” said Dr. David Newman, chief medical officer of virtual care at Sanford Health in South Dakota, in a September statement supporting congressional action to make Medicare telehealth permanent. Bipartisan bills that would have allowed telehealth to continue stalled in committee earlier this year in the Senate and House.
There’s an exception for telehealth rural residents — but only if they travel to a brick-and-mortar health care facility to get the remote health care service.
“The patients have to go to a clinic to receive that telehealth visit from a provider in a different location,” Apple said. “It kind of defeats the purpose.”
According to the Brown University report, California had the highest rate of Medicare telehealth usage in the first six months of this year, with 26% of beneficiaries using at least one telehealth appointment, followed by 23% in Massachusetts and 21% in Hawaii.
There’s no reason for non-Medicare insurers to stop covering any telehealth visits during the shutdown, and even most Medicare Advantage programs will continue to cover telehealth, according to Tina Stow, a spokesperson for AHIP, a health industry trade association.
Nevertheless, at least some health care centers are refusing to take new telehealth appointments or are converting existing ones to office visits.
“This is causing a lot of confusion. We are still working with our members who are insurers and providers to get a gauge on what folks are doing — because at this point reports we’ve seen seem to suggest it is company by company, provider by provider,” said Sean Brown, a spokesperson for the Health Leadership Council, representing CEOs of health care firms and insurers.
The hospital-at-home program serves a smaller number of patients but its pause has caused more disruption: The federal government required patients to be discharged from the program or transferred to a brick-and-mortar hospital by Oct.1.
The Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic had 30 patients in the program in Arizona, Florida and Wisconsin — all of whom either had to be released from the program or sent to brick-and-mortar hospitals. One of Mayo’s hospitals in Florida was already over capacity and had no room for transfers, according to reporting by Becker’s Hospital Review.
In Massachusetts, which requires commercial insurers to follow Medicare guidelines, all insured patients had to leave the program. Mass General Brigham, which operates many hospitals in the state, has rejiggered its plans to create more home care without relying on the hospital-at-home program, according to the Becker’s report.
Congress was unable to avert a shutdown by late September, and some individual providers and patients were caught unawares.
Nurses on social media discussed losing home-care jobs or being reassigned overnight when the hospital-at-home program closed Oct. 1. They worried about patients being taken away from children at home, or placed in hallway beds at overcrowded emergency rooms because of the abrupt change.
“Management scheduled a random call this morning with a super vague title. Then drop the bomb on us,” wrote one poster in Texas. “So no job. Perfect!”
In a direct message, the poster, who didn’t want their name used for fear of getting in trouble at their hospital, told Stateline, “This obviously wasn’t ideal for the patients. One of them had four children and now could no longer be home with them. Some didn’t even get to have a bed in the hospital because there were none available and had to stay in the ER in a hallway bed.”
Parkland Health System in Dallas started tapering off its hospital-at-home program in September because of the impending shutdown, and the last patients were discharged from the program by Sept. 30 without returning to the hospital, spokesperson Wendi Hawthorne said.
“We are hopeful that Congress will renew this innovative model of care in the future,” Hawthorne said.
Likewise, OSF Healthcare in Peoria, Illinois, had started to wind down its hospital-at-home program “to avoid needing to return multiple patients to a very crowded facility,” said Jennifer Junis, president of OSF OnCall, which handles home hospital care.
There were only three patients in the program Sept. 30, all of whom were ready to be discharged without returning to the hospital, Junis said. Since the program’s start in 2020, it has helped 980 patients with home care through OSF’s Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria.
“It is unfortunate that we will not be able to benefit by treating qualifying patients at home, where they are most comfortable and recover faster,” Junis said. “Our digital hospital program has allowed us to free up beds for our sickest patients who need them most.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-10 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Board of Ed: Lawmakers say which charter schools get funded,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/10/charter-schools-ct-danbury-middletown-state-board-of-education-legislature/,"Years ago, a charter school only needed approval from the CT Board of Education to begin operating. But in 2015, the legislature stepped in.","Members of the state Board of Education voted Wednesday to approve a ruling clarifying that they are not responsible for determining which charter schools are permitted to receive state funding. That responsibility falls to lawmakers.
The ruling counters a claim from supporters of two proposed charter schools — one in Middletown and one in Danbury — that, while the legislature appropriates money for charter schools, it should be up to the state board to select the schools that receive those funds. 
“The state board did its job [to approve the initial certification], and now to become a full-fledged charter school … it’s in the hands of the legislature,” said Mike McKeon, the attorney for the state Department of Education.
The decision followed two hours of public testimony during which community members from Danbury and Middletown, charter school leaders and students at Capital Preparatory Harbor School in Bridgeport pleaded with the board to allow Capital Prep Middletown and Danbury charter schools to open. 
In March 2023, the state Board of Education voted to grant an initial certificate of approval for Capital Preparatory Schools to open a charter school in Middletown, overriding the recommendations of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker, who wanted to give community members more time to submit comments to the board. But that June, the legislature decided abruptly to remove funding that it had allocated in the budget for the new charter school, leaving it without the necessary resources to open. The state has not provided any funding for the charter school since. 
Years ago, a charter school only needed approval from the state Board of Education to begin the process of opening. But in 2015, the legislature changed the law to require lawmakers to approve the school’s funding. 
Earlier this year, Capital Preparatory Schools submitted a “Petition for Declaratory Ruling,” asking the state Board of Education to outline clearly which body is responsible for allocating funding to specific charter schools. The Board of Education in May agreed to have the Department of Education look at the charter school funding process and issue a ruling. 
In the petition, Capital Preparatory Schools argued that while the state legislature is responsible for allocating funding to new charter schools in the budget, it should be up to the Board of Education to decide which charter schools receive the money. The organization argued that because Capital Prep Middletown’s application for an initial certificate of approval received the highest score of any charter school the board approved that year, the school deserved to be funded first with the money granted to any new charter schools.
But the Board of Education and the Department of Education disagreed with that argument. In a draft ruling, McKeon wrote that Capital Prep was “misreading” the law and ignoring past application of the law. The ruling noted that lawmakers had clearly chosen not to fund Capital Prep Middletown and that the Board of Education did not have the authority to grant the school funds. 
“Given the legislature’s clear rejection of Capital Prep’s application for charter-school status, and its unambiguous appropriation of funds to two different charter schools, it would have been patently illegal for the State Board or the CSDE to ignore the purpose for which the General Assembly appropriated these funds and apply them elsewhere,” the ruling reads. 
In April, the Danbury Charter School Planning Team and Elevate Charter Schools filed a petition for “party status” in the petition case. The Danbury Charter School for Excellence received an initial certificate of approval in 2018, but has never been funded. 
At the board meeting this Wednesday, Mark Sommaruga, an attorney with Pullman & Comley who is representing Capital Prep, said he believed the declaratory ruling may have been “prejudged,” based upon a January letter from Natalie Braswell, an attorney for Gov. Ned Lamont. In her letter, Braswell said the claim that the state Board of Education acted illegally by not appropriating funding for Capital Prep Middletown was “both baseless and concerning.” 
“In this instance, no funds were appropriated by the legislature for the Capital Preparatory Charter School Middletown. Therefore, any claim [that the Department of Education] is withholding funds unlawfully is categorically false. The law is unequivocal: without a legislative appropriation, SDE cannot and will not disburse funds,” Braswell wrote. 
Anita Ford Saunders, co-chair of the Capital Prep Middletown Planning Committee, said at this week’s meeting that students of color lagged behind white students in academic scores and college and career readiness across the state of Connecticut. 
“ When folks are saying that Middletown doesn’t need Capital Prep — what are you looking at? You’re not looking at the statistics,” she said. “ Give students of color the choice they deserve. Middletown is very different — we are not Bridgeport or Waterbury or Hartford where we have a lot of options. We have the neighborhood public schools.”
Saunders praised Capital Preparatory Schools, saying an overwhelming majority of Capital Prep Harbor School students are considered college or career ready, compared to a much lower proportion statewide. 
Laura Dunkley, a Middletown resident, said she wished that Capital Prep existed when her children were in school. 
“ There are teachers who look at students, in Middletown in particular, where they think [the students] can’t be what they want to be, they can’t succeed because of their color of their skin, whether they’re Hispanic or they’re Black, and that is not fair,” she told members of the board. 
Multiple students from Capital Preparatory Harbor School in Bridgeport, dressed in their school uniforms, lent support to the proposed school in Middletown. They talked about their academic successes, their pride in their school and the help they’d received in planning for the future.
Not everyone spoke in favor of the charter schools. Lisa Loomis-Davern, a former member of the Middletown Board of Education and current assistant principal at Kinsella Magnet School of Performing Arts in Hartford, told the Connecticut Mirror that she didn’t believe Capital Prep was the right fit for Middletown. She said that unlike in Bridgeport, where Capital Prep Harbor School enrolls only a small percentage of the total students in the district, a charter school in the much smaller district of Middletown would take a significant number of students out of the public schools — enough to force a school closure. 
According to their charter application, Capital Prep Middletown would gradually build up enrollment to a maximum of 910 students after 5 years in operation. The current Middletown Public Schools enrollment is about 4,400 students. 
Loomis-Davern, who previously taught at Capital Prep Magnet School in Hartford, said she was concerned that a charter school in Middletown would also draw teachers away from the small city’s public schools when the district is already short-staffed. She also questioned Capital Prep Harbor School’s enrollment practices, noting that it enrolls a lower percentage of students with disabilities and English-language learners than the rest of Bridgeport.
“ Definitely Middletown needs to do better by Black and brown students. Like every district, our public schools were not built to serve Black and brown students well. So I agree 100% that that is an issue. I just don’t think that a Capital Prep charter school is the answer,” she said.
In a statement, Scott Roberts, a spokesperson for Middletown Public Schools, said that the district’s “core mission” is “an unyielding commitment to cultivating the brilliance in each student.” He said school leaders strive to make sure that students feel that they belong. 
“Our community is dedicated to fostering a culture of respect so that every student is empowered to grow and achieve their fullest potential, inside and outside of the classroom,” Roberts said. 
Roberta Downer, president of the Middletown Federation of Teachers, which represents teachers in the district, said in written testimony to the board that the charter schools’ petition was aiming to “circumvent the democratic process.” 
“Middletown’s public schools serve every child who walks through our doors — regardless of background, ability, or circumstance. Our educators are stretched thin, our budgets are tight, and our students’ needs are growing. We cannot afford to divert public money to privately managed schools that serve only a fraction of our community,” Downer said. 
Ford Saunders, of the Capital Prep Middletown Planning Committee, took issue with Downer’s and Loomis-Davern’s claims. She said because of the way Connecticut funds school districts, state support for charter schools would not take money away from the public schools, which receive funding for pupils who attend “choice” schools like charter and magnet schools. She said Capital Prep students are chosen through a lottery system, which gives no indication of whether a student is an English-language learner or has a disability. She also said that charter schools are subject to stricter scrutiny than public schools, including a regular review of their operations and finances by the state Department of Education. In response to concerns about teachers leaving, she said that teachers would have the choice to work wherever they felt was best. 
Danbury 
Many people at Wednesday’s state Board of Education meeting also spoke in support of funding Danbury’s charter school.
Stephen Tracy, chair of the Danbury Charter School Planning Committee, said the proposed school had committed to paying teachers equal or better than those in the Danbury Public Schools, that it had a fully equipped facility and an International Baccalaureate curriculum. He said school leaders had asked the Danbury Public Schools to run the lottery that would pick their students. 
“What we’re facing here is the ideological stubbornness of a handful of politicians who can’t imagine families being able to go outside the established system to find the best school for their kids. That’s it,” said Tracy. 
Tomas Reyes, an Oxford resident and former member of the New Haven Board of Alders, questioned why Danbury was not allowed to open the charter school. 
“Danbury has been waiting seven years. Children don’t get those years back. Those years are gone. Their families don’t get them back, either,” he said.

Other Danbury residents complained that overcrowding in the local public schools was making it difficult for children to receive individual attention and support. Some said not having the charter school was particularly hard on immigrant families. 
Lucas Pimentel, chief executive of Latinos for Educational Advocacy and Diversity — which has been advocating for the charter school — said his own experience coming to Danbury as an immigrant at age 12 made clear what was lacking in the community. 
“I was in a high school of almost 4,000 students. Nobody knew who I was. I barely survived. I’m here by the grace of God,” he said. 
Pimentel said he worked as a teacher for 23 years in a charter school in Bridgeport, where he said he learned the value of teaching children in a small environment. He urged the board to take responsibility for getting the charter school funded. 
“These are your schools. Nobody else is approving the schools, managing the schools. This is your community,” he said. 
One Board of Education member, Seth Zimmerman, voted against the ruling, saying he felt there was “real ambiguity” in the law around what it meant to approve a charter school and who had that authority. According to a Department of Education estimate, five or six charter schools have been granted initial approval by the board but have not been funded. 
McKeon said that while he felt some of the concerns speakers raised at the meeting were strong, there was nothing that the state Board of Education could legally do beyond issuing the initial certificate of approval.
“They should be addressing the General Assembly. They should be addressing the legislature that they have elected, because it is only the legislature that can turn a charter school applicant into a charter school,” said McKeon.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1008_SR_MiddletownCharter_023-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-10 05:56:16.556752

(Getty Images)Every time an infectious disease makes the news, public trust in health systems is tested. But sometimes the threat isn’t the disease itself — it’s how we talk about it. That’s why publicizing “two positive tuberculosis tests” in a state of 1.4 million people is not just misleading; it’s irresponsible from a public health perspective.
Context matters
Tuberculosis (TB) is a well-understood, treatable, and closely monitored infection. In New Hampshire — as in every state — public health professionals conduct routine screening among certain populations, such as health-care workers, correctional staff, and people immigrating from regions where TB is more common. A small number of positive tests every year is normal, expected, and reflects the vigilance of the system — not a sign of an outbreak.
Announcing two positive tests without explaining that context distorts risk perception. It invites unnecessary fear and stigmatization of individuals and communities who may already face barriers to care. In a population of 1.4 million, two positive tests represent a rate of roughly one case per 700,000 people — statistically insignificant and far below national averages. Yet when stripped of that denominator, “two cases” can sound ominous.
The cost of alarmism
Public health communication relies on precision and proportion. Sensationalized reporting can have real-world consequences: it can erode confidence in health authorities, discourage people from seeking testing or treatment, and stigmatize those affected. Fear-based headlines don’t make people safer; they make people skeptical.
When media or officials highlight tiny numbers without context, they inadvertently suggest that surveillance systems are failing, when in fact those systems are functioning exactly as intended — detecting, treating, and preventing spread quietly and effectively.
What responsible communication looks like
A responsible public health message would emphasize that:

TB screening is routine and helps protect communities.
A few positive tests each year are expected and manageable.
No evidence suggests community transmission or elevated risk.
Prevention and treatment remain highly effective and accessible.

Clear, measured communication builds confidence that public health systems are doing their job. It reassures the public that experts are tracking the situation with vigilance, not panic.
The bottom line
The role of both journalism and public communication in health crises is to inform, not inflame. Announcing “two TB cases” as though it’s breaking news in a population of 1.4 million is like reporting a drizzle as a flood. It distracts from genuine threats, undermines trust, and sows confusion about what real public health risks look like.

Ohio […]","The use of telehealth for abortion care has continued to grow in the U.S., according to the latest #WeCount report, particularly since five states passed laws legally shielding providers who work with patients living in states with bans. (Warodom Changyencham/Getty Images)Two Ohio bills that may have effects on abortion medication and access were considered in separate Ohio House committees this week.
Opponents of a bill to further regulate medication that could include abortion drugs deeply criticized a study used by supporters of the measure, and argued about the unintended consequences held in the legislation.
Ohio State University epidemiology professor Dr. Alison Norris said a study on the safety of abortion drug mifepristone cited by supporters of the bill to prove the dangers of the drug was “deeply flawed,” causing concern about the types of evidence sources the bill would allow the Ohio Department of Health to use in determining drug risks.
The study counted the number of emergency room visits for any reason as part of the “adverse effects” of mifepristone, Norris said, leading to a conclusion that stands in contrast to “more than 100 peer-reviewed studies from over 25 years …that create a strong scientific evidence base to show mifepristone is safe.”
Citing other studies and data from the CDC, Norris said the risk of giving birth was 14 times more likely to result in death than having an abortion.
“The example of mifepristone regulation that proponent testimony offers shows how H.B. 324 could tie Ohioans’ medical care to misleading and poorly analyzed data,” Norris told the House Health Committee on Wednesday. “It could lead to a change in standard medical care that would harm Ohioans.”
The bill in question, House Bill 324, seeks to identify medications that have “severe adverse effects” in more than 5% of users. Data from the FDA, insurance claims and patient reports would be used by the state health department to determine the risk level of a prescription and over-the-counter drugs, particularly the risk of death, hospitalization from infection or hemorrhage, organ failure or sepsis, according to the bill.
Categorization of a drug as having severe adverse effects in more than 5% of users would require the drug to be given out only after an in-person exam and also would require a follow-up appointment be scheduled. This would limit the ability for Ohioans to use telehealth for certain medications.
Mifepristone is only one of many drugs that could be affected by the legislation, and not being able to prescribe drugs through telehealth could impact rural communities and older Ohioans as well as those looking for reproductive care, advocates at the committee hearing said.
“The bill’s extremely broad definitions could impact access to drugs such as Plavix, Wellbutrin, metformin, atorvastatin, amoxicillin and ibuprofen, to name a few,” said Lora Miller, director of governmental affairs and public relations for the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXPlavix is a medication used to prevent blood clots, Wellbutrin is an antidepressant, metformin is used in diabetes treatment, atorvastatin treats high cholesterol, amoxicillin is an antibiotic, and ibuprofen is a common over-the-counter pain reliever.
“Patients managing common conditions could face unnecessary costs and delays, especially those with limited insurance coverage,” Miller said.
Republicans on the committee sought to clarify the regulations in the bill, emphasizing that any medication under the 5% risk threshold wouldn’t be impacted. State Rep. Angela King, R-Celina, listed the specific adverse effects included in the bill after Miller named effects from drugs like amoxicillin and Wellbutrin, from vaginal hemorrhage to urinary tract infections. King made a point to note the bill mentioned hospitalization for infection, not just the infections themselves.
“Urinary tract infection can definitely put someone in the hospital,” Miller responded. “I can tell you that because it put me in the hospital.”
Miller said low-income patients will be particularly hard hit by the bill as written “by added visits, costs and travel requirements.”
“The bill unintentionally widens health disparities across Ohio communities,” she said. “The absence of any exceptions virtually ensures that existing barriers to care and medication access will be exacerbated.”
The legislation may be duplicative as well, according to opponents. Miller and Norris both said federal law and the FDA already dictate the risks of various drugs, and “very robust systems” of medical training, ethics codes and laws already in place exist to ensure “health care providers balance the risks versus the benefits of the medicines that they prescribe,” according to Norris.
“This law seems not necessary to me because it’s inviting an extra level of scrutiny, and because it has methodological problems deeply embedded in it,” Norris said.
 Medicaid funding
In another committee, supporters praised a bill that would eliminate state Medicaid funding to reproductive health clinics who provide abortions. Federal law already prohibits Medicaid funding from being used for abortion services, but religious and anti-abortion groups indicated that doesn’t go far enough in barring the indirect funding of abortion services.
Ohio Right to Life legislative director Katie DeLand began her testimony for House Bill 410 in the Ohio House Medicaid Committee by thanking the General Assembly for allocating $20 million to pregnancy resource centers in the most recent state operating budget. Pregnancy resource centers are largely religiously based centers who provide services such as ultrasounds and post-birth supplies like diapers.
Grants through the state that have gone to pregnancy resource centers specifically bar any funding from going to facilities who promote or conduct abortion services, and the centers, also called crisis pregnancy centers, have been criticized for providing medically debunked information to discourage abortion to clients.
“House Bill 410 builds directly on this work, drawing a clear line: while Ohio will invest in prenatal and family resources, we will not finance abortion services that end a child’s life,” DeLand said.
The bill DeLand and others stood in support of this week seeks to keep state Medicaid funding from going to any facility that includes abortion services as part of their operations, even funding for things like “administrative overhead” or “referral activities.”
“Redirecting these funds away from abortion providers ensures that Ohio’s resources are invested in true health care and life-affirming services, like the pregnancy resource centers that received funding earlier this summer,” DeLand told the committee.
The Catholic Conference of Ohio also spoke in support of the bill, calling abortion “among the most, if not the most, contentious subjects of our times.”
“While the majority of Ohioans voted in a measure which amended the constitution to allow abortion, it is also essential to consider the consciences of the 1.6 million Ohioans who did not,” said Marsha Forshon, associate director of the CCO.
The pieces of legislation are two of several currently active in the Ohio General Assembly that cause pro-abortion rights advocates to once again question whether the legislature is respecting the 57% vote in 2023 that enshrined reproductive rights including abortion into the Ohio Constitution.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Much of the federal government has been closed for business since last week. 
A poll released last week indicates that many Americans are just tuning into a big part of what the fight’s about. But as they are, a huge majority believe insurance subsidies should be extended — including for 427,000 Ohioans.
The government shut down on Oct. 1 as the Republican majority in Congress couldn’t get enough votes to fund the government for another seven weeks. Senate Democrats are demanding several concessions on health care before they’ll support it.
An important one is making permanent tax credits for health insurance purchased on the individual markets created by the Affordable Care Act. Created in 2021, last year they provided an average annual subsidy of $705.
As part of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Republicans this summer extended massive 2017 tax cuts that are heavily skewed in favor of the richest Americans.
But so far, they’ve been unwilling to consider extending the ACA tax credits, which are set to expire Dec. 31. Open enrollment begins Nov. 1, and health care experts are predicting that premiums will more than double for most of the 24 million Americans who buy insurance in the marketplaces. 
Already in Ohio, companies that offer products on the exchanges are requesting rate hikes as high as 40%.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Two days after the government shutdown, the health-analysis nonprofit KFF conducted a tracking poll regarding the insurance subsidies.
It found that most Americans were new to the issue, with 61% saying they knew only a little or nothing at all about it. 
But their preferences were clear when they were told what the fight was about: “As you may know, in 2021 Congress increased the financial help provided through tax credits available to some people with low and moderate incomes who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace to help them afford their premiums.”
Asked if they thought Congress should extend the credits or let them expire, a whopping 78% said they wanted to see them extended. That includes 82% of independents, 59% of Republicans and 57% of self-identified MAGA supporters.
Bipartisan majorities also said they would be “very concerned” to learn that expiration of the subsidies might make insurance unaffordable, or cause 4 million people to lose coverage altogether, or would harm small-business employees and self-employed Americans. If the number of uninsured Americans increases, so will the burden of uncompensated care on already-stressed rural and safety-net hospitals.
As often happens, there can be a disconnect between the policies Americans want and whether they want to pay for them. 
Asked, “If Congress extends these enhanced tax credits, how concerned would you be if you heard that it would require significant federal spending that would be largely paid for by taxpayers?”
Sixty three percent said they would be very or somewhat concerned at that prospect.

The question is how news media organizations and journalists respond. (Illustration by Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)During office hours last week, one of my University of Kansas journalism students asked a great question.
I am paraphrasing: “What do we do with all of these journalism companies bending to the Trump administration? It seems like it’s time to discard them and move on to something different.”
I understand his point. 
Over the past year, some news companies appear increasingly willing to obey President Donald Trump’s demands about reporting. 
Since Trump’s election, CBS News (Paramount) and ABC News (Disney) both settled lawsuits, not with the federal government, but with the president personally. These were defamation claims that many legal experts believed that the news outlets easily could have defended in court. Other lawsuits are in progress.
Caving to Trump felt like an unnecessary admission of guilt — if not supplication to his demands. 
Similarly, during the runup to the 2024 presidential election, the Washington Post backed away from its tradition of endorsing presidential candidates, an endorsement that was poised to go to Trump’s rival, Kamala Harris. Angry readers canceled their subscriptions and pilloried owner Jeff Bezos.
This perceived obedience creates tension for liberal readers. Stick with the relatively neutral legacy media that has recently wilted before Trump? Or spend your time with media that shares your defiant politics?
The answer is vital because Democratic readers are the most stable segment of the audience for journalism.
Polling by Gallup from 2001 to 2024 tracked the public’s distrust in the mass media, asking whether the news gets reported fully. During that time, the line of increasing distrust among Republicans has been steep.
Meanwhile, Democrats maintained high levels of trust in the media. For more than two decades, starting in 2001, Democratic distrust inched up and down between 5% and a high of 16% in 2015. 
With my students’ question serving as a canary in the coal mine, I worry that liberal frustrations with journalists will also soon rise. 
Most recently, publications quaked in their responses to the assassination of Charlie Kirk. I have spoken to journalists in Kansas, students and professionals, who worried about how coverage would be received. In some cases, those concerns nudged them to delay or hold off reporting stories. 
The audience for news — our readers and viewers — has noticed. 
Last week, a friend, sensing that the news feels different these days, asked me how journalists are processing all of this — and when they would find their courage again. This friend knows journalism, both as a loyal reader and the child of a longtime journalist. She pointed to legal firms that stood firm against demands from the Trump administration. 
In other words, readers sense journalistic fear. 
Since my first high school byline, I have worked in journalism for more than 30 years. No crisis — the Bush v. Gore coverage in 2000, the runup to the invasion of Iraq in 2004, the search for a cause for COVID-19 — measures up to the vertigo of this moment. 
The atmosphere about free expression among journalists has never felt so fraught. 
However, the instability has been a long time coming — not just for journalism, but for many American institutions. 
During his two administrations and two campaigns, Trump has been relentlessly effective at chipping away at institutions. 
Government agencies, from the EPA to the FBI, stagger forward, emaciated and maligned. Trump has also gutted cultural institutions and stuffed them full of his personal taste and henchmen. University life has been set on a knife edge. 
In the midst of these other major Trump-mandated changes, I understand that my focus on journalism looks like navel-gazing: yet another journalist fussing about the future of news. 
Yet, consider how Gallup’s polling gives urgency to this. Since 2015, when Trump entered the political arena, a wide swath of American institutions have suffered declining trust, but only by a few percentage points. Government institutions only slid 2 points (24% to 22%) and a combination of nine other institutions lost 4 points (37% to 33%). 
Television news and newspapers fell 8 percentage points, ending at an embarrassing 15% in 2024.  
I find this trend in journalism especially newsworthy because of the specific way that it has played out: as an attack from the right that, I predict, will soon trigger a backlash from the left.
Since his first presidential campaign, Trump has criticized journalists for being too liberal and for opposing him, a right-flank attack that convinced many conservative Americans that reporters cannot be trusted. 
In August, the Pew Research Center released polling that showed the depth of that mistrust among Republicans. When asked if most journalists are “biased,” 74% of respondents who identify as Republican or lean Republican said yes. A majority of those conservatives also see the media as “elitist” and “dishonest.”
Meanwhile, people who identify as Democrats or lean Democratic felt at least 26 percentage points more favorable in each of those categories. A slight majority of liberal respondents say most journalists are “intelligent,” “well-intentioned” and “relatable.” 
As Trump eroded conservative trust by painting journalists as too liberal, he has eroded trust among liberals by making journalists supplicant. 
The twin messages from the White House — journalists peddle fake news and we will make them too scared to be effective — are not just being heard by journalists. Both messages are being heard by our audience, from one political extreme to the other. 
Our conservative audience was first to downgrade their image of us, but I worry that independents and liberals will soon follow in greater numbers. 
In the media, commentators and columnists tsk-tsked Trump for years, worried about him burning down institutions and washing away norms. I admit that I was complacent, imagining the loss of a nameless ivory tower, rather than the profession that I love, the one where I essentially live. 
Ten years into Trump’s attack on journalism, journalists find ourselves dismissed by people at one end of the political extreme and at risk of losing the trust from the other.
Before the questioning student left my office, I asked him to consider if we can afford to discard robust journalism right now, at a time when other institutions are threatened. 
He paused and looked down. And then, he answered with a shrug, saying, “I guess, I don’t know.”

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.)Never forget that the Ohioan who is a heartbeat away from the presidency — and chomping at the bit to replace the aging, increasingly incoherent incumbent — said he makes things up to get attention. 
JD Vance, the former first-term Ohio senator who wheedled his way into the good graces of a convicted felon (he once called an “idiot”) to become vice-president, flat out declared his willingness “to create stories” last year while defending his false, racist rumors of Haitian immigrants abducting and eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. 
It was a remarkable confession from a craven opportunist who scarcely hid his power lust. 
Today Vance salivates over sitting behind the Resolute Desk and proves time and again that he will do and say whatever it takes to get there. 
Ohioans saw his politically expedient metamorphosis from anti-Trumper to bearded MAGA poser in his rocky U.S. Senate campaign. They watched Vance prostrate himself before a disgraced ex-president to snag an endorsement and pull off an improbable win.
His brief stint in the U.S. Senate was largely spent auditioning to be Trump’s presidential running mate with performative, made-for-Fox News theatrics and bookings. Vance won the part and the vice-presidency. 
That politicians lie is hardly news. But Vance does it pathologically, like his boss. Except the veep isn’t Trump. The Ohio politician doesn’t get a pass on lying or acting like a jerk. That’s reserved for the twice-impeached adjudicated fraudster and sexual abuser who famously bragged he could get away with anything and not lose any voters. 
Vance gets no such reprieve. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When he fumbles and fabricates with obvious untruths, the veep gets worldwide ridicule and even worse favorability ratings. 
Yet driven by ambition, Vance persists in repeating disproven claims, believing it will benefit his 2028 prospects rather than harm them. 
He may be right. 
Vance catapulted to the White House as Trump’s understudy despite the dehumanizing story he invented to terrorize lawful immigrant workers in his home state. 
He amplified all sorts of lies in the 2024 campaign, including false claims about a stolen election that wasn’t and Trump saving Obamacare which he tried to kill.  
Nevertheless, some in the MAGA camp still look askance at Vance’s transformation from Never-Trumper to Biggest-Trump-Fan-Ever. 
Authentic doesn’t describe the Silicon Valley venture capitalist-turned-MAGA grievance peddler. 
Little wonder Vance was tanking in the Republican primary race for the Ohio U.S. Senate seat until his billionaire pals came to the rescue with Trump’s blessing.
But the 41-year-old from Middletown, Ohio is a climber on his way to the top. 
He is a restless vice president who covets his boss’ job. 
Problem is Vance has neither Trump’s charisma nor entertainment chops — let alone his cult of personality. To be fair, it’s doubtful any red-tie wearing sycophant does. 
Yet from the moment Vance boarded Air Force Two, he began sharpening his skills set as a front man for the Trump regime who could effortlessly dispense spin on the daily with scant connection to reality. 
His list of whoppers have effectively erased any pretense that the prospective president-in-waiting is a straight shooter who can be trusted to tell the truth. 
But frankly, Vance forfeited the mantle of credibility when he confessed a penchant for inventing fairy tales as a means to an end. He admitted he was willing to manufacture stories that weren’t true to generate headlines that paid off politically.   
Everything Vance says must be weighed in the context of that admission.  He essentially copped to lying as a partisan ploy for publicity. 
 Last week the veep super-charged a lie so big and so brazen about the Republican government shutdown it was almost not worth addressing — save for the people who might be misled by the ploy to juice up media attention. 
It was a story created out of whole cloth that falsely tied the shutdown to Democrats’ alleged drive to give all immigrants health care. Pure fabrication. But Vance ran with it.
As the U.S. headed for a shutdown a week ago, the shameless Ohioan repeated what he must have known had no basis in fact: “Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens.”  
Vance and other Republicans continued to parrot the made-up claim even after it was factually refuted as fantasy. 
Nowhere in the Democrats’ proposal, which Republicans refused to negotiate, is there any demand to fund health care for people in the U.S. unlawfully — who have never been eligible federally funded Medicaid, Medicare, or Affordable Care Act tax credits. 
Democrats want Republicans to extend a temporary Biden-era program that lowered health insurance costs for more than 20 million Americans buying coverage through the ACA. 
They also want Republicans, who control the White House and Congress, to undo at least some of the dramatic Medicaid cuts the GOP enacted over the summer in Trump’s godawful bill. 
But Vance isn’t focused on the dire financial stakes facing low-to middle-income Ohioans or citizens across the country. He has stories to create and appearances to book.

(Photo provided by the Indiana Department of Correction)Death row inmate Roy Lee Ward was executed by lethal injection early Friday morning at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, marking the state’s second execution of 2025 and the third since resuming the death penalty after more than a decade-long hiatus.
Indiana Department of Correction officials said in a statement that “the execution process started shortly after” 12 a.m. Central Time and Ward, 53, was pronounced dead at 12:33 a.m. CT.
He was convicted and sentenced to death for the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County.
It remains unclear, however, when exactly the execution drug was administered, the amount of pentobarbital used, or who witnessed the execution.

“Early this morning, the execution of Roy Lee Ward was carried out, delivering accountability for the brutal rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne on April 16, 2001,” said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in an an early Friday statement. “Following his 2007 conviction and death sentence, Ward’s case was thoroughly reviewed, culminating in the Indiana Supreme Court setting his execution date and Governor Mike Braun rejecting his request for clemency.”
“Today, we honor Stacy Payne’s memory and bring long-awaited closure to her family and loved ones,” Rokita continued. “I extend my heartfelt thanks to our office’s appeals team, who dedicated thousands of hours and exceptional talent to upholding the jury’s verdict and ensuring the law was enforced. The Indiana Department of Correction carried out this sentence with utmost professionalism, reinforcing the state’s commitment to protecting our communities from violent predators. Let this stand as a resolute warning: those who commit such heinous crimes will face the full weight of justice.”
The Indiana Capital Chronicle was not invited to witness Ward’s execution. Ward’s defense team declined to provide specifics about the inmate’s witness list but said no media were present in the witness room.
“ … for years Roy has told me that if his execution would make Stacy’s family feel any better, that that is what he wants,”  Laura Volk, one of Ward’s lawyers, said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. 
“Initially, I saw a sad, broken man. I assume that was how he felt because of him coming to terms with what he had done to Stacy, her family and his family and friends,” she added. “Throughout the years, I have witnessed a transformation. He has become a person who is kind and generous to the people around him. Clearly in prison, a person’s ability to help others is severely limited. They have little and little is given to them. Through the years, Roy has taken what he has and given it to others. I have witnessed him help others in the small ways he can. It is a transformation that our society hopes to happen while one is incarcerated.  In the 25 years I have been doing this work, I can say Roy is a different person than when he went in.”
Ward’s execution came after years of legal appeals and recent, increased scrutiny over the state’s secrecy surrounding lethal injection drugs.
Gov. Mike Braun’s office has refused to disclose how much the state paid for the latest three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the Department of Correction in recent months, however.
At least one of those sets of pentobarbital was expected to be used for Ward’s execution. Any unused drugs will expire at the end of the month, according to new court documents.
The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
“Roy Lee Ward’s case has been heard and reviewed numerous times by both state and federal courts, including the Indiana Supreme Court, since his conviction in 2002. These reviews have never resulted in an overturned sentence,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a statement. “The State Parole Board issued a unanimous recommendation to deny Ward’s final appeal for clemency and that his execution proceed as scheduled. Today, Ward’s sentence has been carried out as ordered by the court.”
Ward’s final hours
Outside the prison Thursday night, a small group of anti-death penalty advocates gathered to read scriptures and pray. Among them were members of the Indiana Abolition Coalition and the Diocese of Gary.
Death Penalty Action, a nonprofit that advocates against executions, loaned to protestors the “Delaware Bell,” which the group has rung outside more than a dozen other executions.
The small, quiet protests have become a ritual at the Indiana State Prison, where clergy and activists have gathered before each of the past three executions to call for an end to capital punishment.
“Roy Ward can be held accountable and severely punished without executing him,” said Abraham Bonowitz, executive director of Death Penalty Action.

DOC officials said Ward’s last meal was from Texas Corral and consisted of: one hamburger, one steak melt, one order of French fries, one baked potato with butter, one order of twelve fried shrimp, one sweet potato, one order of chicken alfredo, and one order of breadsticks.
His last words were, “Brian is going to read them.”
The inmate’s lawyers withdrew the final two federal lawsuits that sought to delay his execution after reaching an agreement with DOC that “ensures compliance” with the state prison’s written execution protocol. The cases were officially dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on Thursday.
Ward did not pursue a last-ditch reprieve from the U.S. Supreme Court like previous Indiana death row inmates. The nation’s high court justices denied such efforts ahead of the state’s previous two executions.
Ward clemency hearing: Victim’s family asks for ‘no mercy,’ defense cites autism diagnosis, remorse

The Indiana Parole Board recommended against clemency last month, citing the “heinous” nature of Ward’s crime. Ward declined to be interviewed by the board, but his defense team’s testimony emphasized a recent autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and Ward’s expressions of remorse. 
Braun subsequently allowed the execution to proceed.
State law does not provide access for journalists to witness executions unless invited by the condemned person. A federal lawsuit challenging that restriction is still pending. The Indiana Capital Chronicle is a plaintiff in the case.
In December, the Capital Chronicle was the only news organization present when the state executed Joseph Corcoran, the first person put to death in Indiana in nearly 15 years. The Capital Chronicle was not invited for Benjamin Ritchie’s execution in May.
Witnesses at Ritchie’s execution reported seeing the inmate lurch violently against his restraints after the injection began. DOC officials denied those reports, however, and maintained that “the execution was completed according to protocol.” No members of the media were permitted to witness Ritchie’s execution.
The witness accounts were at the heart of multiple legal challenges and grievances filed by Ward in recent months. His legal team raised concerns about the state’s drug-handling procedures, including storage temperatures, the source and quality of pentobarbital, and whether the DOC followed its own internal directives during Ritchie’s execution.
A ‘heinous’ crime
First responders and relatives recounted the details of Payne’s final moments in emotional testimony before the Indiana Parole Board last month.
Deputy Attorney General Tyler Banks called Ward “a murderer, a rapist, a predator and a manipulator,” emphasizing that two separate juries had reached the same conclusion that his crime warranted death.

Witnesses told the board Ward entered the teenager’s home before her shift at Jenk’s Pizza. Ward proceeded to rape Payne and attack her with a dumbbell and knife. She was left with 18 blunt-force injuries, her throat and abdomen cut open.
Dale Town Marshal Matt Keller, the first officer on the scene, said he found Ward standing in the doorway with a knife in his hand and tried to reassure the wounded girl that help was coming. 
Paramedic Jane Stout testified she had “never seen anything this brutal,” recalling that Payne was conscious but unable to speak because of her injuries, tears in her eyes as she struggled to breathe.
Payne’s mother, Julie Wininger, told the parole board her family had endured “8,839 days of emotional devastation,” and that granting clemency “would tell the world that Stacy’s life didn’t matter.”
Her daughter — a highschooler on summer break — was an honor student, cheerleader, member of student council and active in her school’s band.
Ward’s attorneys countered that he had long struggled with mental illness and was recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. They argued that his disability had affected how jurors perceived his remorse, noting that he once wrote he avoided saying “sorry” only because “it would sound fake and not be believed.”
Indiana’s execution process
Indiana resumed executions in 2024 after a nearly 15-year pause, following years of difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs after pharmaceutical companies — under growing scrutiny — refused to sell their products for use in executions.
But state officials have refused to reveal where the state obtains its pentobarbital, citing a 2017 secrecy statute that shields the identity of suppliers.
Lethal injection is the only method permitted by state law. Indiana’s current single-drug protocol calls for an intravenous dose of pentobarbital, a fast-acting barbiturate.
It’s unlikely that any additional executions will be carried out at the state prison this year.
Five men remain on Indiana’s death row, but only four have been deemed competent to be executed. In order for a capital punishment to be carried out, the state must request and be granted an execution date from the state supreme court — a process that can take weeks or months.

(Photo courtesy Charm City Care ConnectionBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) on Thursday announced an upcoming grant program for opioid reduction efforts, an announcement that came on the heels of the city’s third mass overdose event in recent months.
Scott said he hopes the new grants, funded with money from the settlements of lawsuits against opioid manufacturers, can help prevent future mass overdose events and provide individuals struggling with addiction easier access to resources.
“This is not the first overdose incident we’ve seen at Penn North in recent months and we continue to do everything that we can to support our residents.” Scott said Thursday during a virtual briefing of the grant program.
“We know we have work to do, but we have never been in a better position to end this crisis,” he said. “We have the will. We have the people. And most importantly now, we have the funding.”
Scott’s comments came as he was announcing an upcoming opportunity for community organizations and support services to receive grants to help combat drug overdoses in the city. Through community grants under the Opioid Restitution Fund, organizations can compete for up to $500,000 in funding, depending on their project proposals.
The total grant funding allocated for fiscal 2026 is $2 million, a fraction of the $579.9 million that Baltimore has received through court settlements.
Baltimore lays out plan to distribute millions in settlement funding from opioid lawsuits

In 2018, the city opted out of national legal challenges of pharmaceutical companies for their role in the opioid epidemic, choosing to pursue its own lawsuit instead. It was a risky move but it paid off: The more than half a billion the city has raked in in settlements is far above what it would have received as part of a larger group.
Last year, Scott issued an executive order creating the Opioid Restitution Fund, which helps direct the settlement payments to combat opioid and overdoses in the city over the next 15 years. The $2 million offered in the upcoming grant program is just one part of a larger system of opioid reduction efforts that the city will be taking through those settlement funds.
“While there is no simple solution to solve this crisis overnight, we will continue to push to save every life that we can,” Scott said.
The city will launch a grant application portal Oct. 23, with information for organizations interested in applying for a grant, which would not be distributed until the next calendar year.
The grant program will focus on three areas for overdose response:

Programs aiming to increase access to mobile overdose treatment services could receive up to $500,000 in grant funds.
Organizations focused on harm-reduction could get up to $250,000. Such efforts include increased distribution of the opioid overdose reversal medication naloxone, clean-syringe services and wound care, among others.
The grant program will also apply to more general social support services. Organizations focused on providing access to housing, food assistance, education and employment could get up to $50,000 in grant funding from the program.

The request for proposals officially opens Oct. 23. “This RFP is about investing back into the neighborhoods that have been the hardest-hit by the opioid crisis and keeping the priorities and needs of Baltimore City residents front and center,” Scott said Thursday.
He added that investigations on the Wednesday overdose incident are ongoing. In that incident, 11 nonfatal overdoses occurred near the Penn North neighborhood, with seven people hospitalized and four people declined transport, according to news reports.
Baltimore crime, homicide drops overshadowed by fear of federal actions hindering gains

Wednesday’s incident followed dozens more overdoses that occurred this summer. On July 10, a mass overdose sent 27 people to the hospital for treatment. A week later, five more people were hospitalized after an overdose.
Sara Whaley, executive director of overdose response for the city, said that she hopes the grants from the opioid settlement fund support programs that help prevent more mass overdoses.
“In light of the overdoses yesterday and the mass overdose events in July, we know just how critical this work is to saving lives,” she said.
“Mobile services can go where they are needed because they are not tied to brick and mortar,” she said. “Having more of these types of programs that can go throughout the city and go to areas or be responsive to things like a mass overdose event, to bring services directly where they are needed – I think that allows us a lot of flexibility.”
She stressed that the mobile services will also help smaller or individual overdoses. She said that city officials focused on opioid reduction were already interested in boosting mobile services before the mass overdose incidents this year.
“Mobile services are one option,” Whaley said. “That in addition to naloxone distribution. Other things, like drug-checking programs, drug-testing supplies, would care and things like that … can also help facilitate connections to treatment or other supportive services.”

(Courtesy of Omaha Public Power District)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers sued the Omaha Public Power District on Thursday, seeking to stop a plan to retire three of five power-producing units at the utility’s North Omaha Station and switch the other two coal-fired units to natural gas. 
The 46-page lawsuit, filed in Douglas County District Court, seeks to stop the changes planned for the North Omaha Station, as well as prevent OPPD from pursuing any policy that prioritizes considerations other than price or reliability, including “environmental justice.” Residents had fought to get OPPD to modify the plant, citing health concerns. 
Hilgers said data doesn’t support the assertion that the plant harms neighbors’ health. 
In a midday announcement, he said he wants to focus the publicly owned utility on what he says state law requires: reliability and affordability. He said OPPD’s plan for the North Omaha plant would retire 240 megawatts of electricity production as OPPD sees skyrocketing increases in demand. Though the local power district’s plan says moving forward is contingent on opening new power-generation facilities this year, Hilgers said the changes wouldn’t add power capacity and would only help OPPD “tread water.”
“We should not be taking one electron off the grid,” Hilgers said.

OPPD declined to comment because of pending litigation. Multiple board members could not be reached for comment.
Targeted in the lawsuit are OPPD, its CEO and president and six of eight elected OPPD directors. It was not immediately clear why board members John Hudson and Michael Cavanaugh are not named in the lawsuit. One of the elected members, Sara Howard, served with Hilgers in the Legislature, where she chaired the  Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee.
North Omaha State Sens. Ashlei Spivey and Terrell McKinney said they adamantly disagree with Hilgers’ decision. Both said energy rates might rise, partly due to unregulated data centers requiring more power or other power demands, but not because of the North Omaha Station plan.
Spivey, a member of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, called the lawsuit a “witch hunt” she said is meant to “strong-arm” OPPD into following state leaders’ political whims.
“We have seen the AG’s Office do that a number of times on a number of divisive political issues,” Spivey said. “It’s a waste of taxpayer dollars.”
‘Delays are at an end’
In 2014 and 2016, OPPD directors agreed to a plan that, by 2023, OPPD would retire the three North Omaha units in operation since the 1950s and switch the other two in operation since the 1960s from coal to natural gas. The oldest three units switched to natural gas in 2016.

The plan was delayed in 2022 and then made contingent upon the construction of two new power-producing stations: Standing Bear Lake and Turtle Creek. Combined, OPPD has said those facilities would produce 600 megawatts, more than all of the units operating now in North Omaha.
The timing could be tied to OPPD, which appears ready to move forward with the North Omaha Station plan during a “procedural” meeting next week, Spivey said.
Hilgers, too, said he feels “the delays are at an end” and that’s part of why the lawsuit came now. He said it takes a lot of work to decommission power plants, a process he said is also hard to unwind.
Supply and demand
Part of the AG’s concern comes as OPPD hopes to achieve a greener-energy goal of “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, a plan the utility board approved in 2019. OPPD leaders are balancing the desire to meet that goal, which was set when demand for electricity was fairly flat, with rapid recent increases in consumer demand for power. 
“Ultimately, it is a supply and demand issue,” Hilgers said. “It would defy reality and economics to suggest that taking 200-plus megawatts offline, given this demand environment we’re in, will do anything other than increase the cost to [OPPD] ratepayers.”
On health concerns, Hilgers said he checked the air quality in North Omaha on his phone just hours before his afternoon event. The quality was at 29, he said, on a metric that considers any number under 50 “great.” He said he’s not dismissing air quality as a concern, nor is he saying local control doesn’t matter.

However, Hilgers argued that taking energy production offline would undermine the utility’s key legal guideposts of affordability and reliability. He argued OPPD directors elevated “environmental justice” as equally or more important in violation of a 1963 Nebraska law that the state “provide for dependable electric service at the lowest practical cost.”
Nebraska is the only state with exclusively publicly owned utilities providing power.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen was among those praising Hilgers on Thursday, calling it “foolish” for any power district to avoid coal, a resource he called “the single most affordable means of energy production known to mankind.” He pointed to coal reserves in neighboring Wyoming as a plus and said coal production is cleaner today than before, with “science is on our side.”
“Foreign adversaries have sped up their own coal production, most notably China and Russia,” Pillen said in a statement. “It is unfathomable why we would take any action that would slow or stop our own expansion of coal-driven energy.”
OPPD serves about 1 million Nebraskans, Hilgers said, in a service area that spans 13 eastern Nebraska counties, including much of the Omaha area.
‘Stop acting like a dictator’
The two North Omaha state senators said they see a different health reality on the ground, including on Wednesday, when they hosted a town hall with OPPD Director Eric Williams, whose district includes North Omaha. Most questions were for Williams and sought more information about the North Omaha plant transition, Spivey said.

McKinney said his constituents have faced respiratory problems, with Spivey noting her oldest son has asthma and that the concerns impact whether her constituents can achieve the “good life.” McKinney said a daycare owner close to the power plant annually cleans residue left behind, and McKinney argued state leaders “only care about dollars and cents.”
“It’s time for Hilgers to stop acting like a dictator and let our public power utilities do their job: providing affordable, reliable and clean energy for the people who actually own it,” McKinney said.
McKinney said that to say coal isn’t harmful is “ignorant, to say the least.” McKinney said that if Hilgers is focused on affordability and reliability, “he should build a coal plant in his backyard and let it burn on his property and see how he feels.”
Hilgers said there are “plenty of avenues” for the public to work with OPPD and find solutions without shutting down an “enormous amount of power.” Spivey said the community has already worked with OPPD for the solution at hand.
‘True cost’ of ‘net-zero?’
Part of Hilgers’ lawsuit relies upon and cites information gathered this summer and fall as part of Legislative Resolution 234, an interim study from freshman State Sen. Jared Storm of David City and 19 other lawmakers into the “true cost” of “net-zero” carbon emissions plans.
Storm could not be reached for comment Thursday.

The Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee hosted a Sept. 5 hearing on Storm’s LR 234, in which State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln accused Storm and his cosponsors — including five of Conrad’s fellow committee members — of each being a “climate denier or a climate skeptic.”
Storm told Conrad he knows the climate is constantly changing and that his resolution was about keeping power affordable and maintaining jobs and the community. He wanted an “off-ramp” for consumers. His resolution could hint at legislation for the 2026 legislative session.
“I’m all for green energy, if it can stay affordable, reliable and doesn’t sacrifice Nebraska jobs,” Storm told Conrad.
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, the Natural Resources Committee chair who was among those signing onto Storm’s resolution, reached out to OPPD and three other utilities in July in preparation for LR 234. Brandt specifically asked OPPD about its North Omaha plans.

OPPD CEO and President Javier Fernandez told Brandt that while OPPD’s system is forecasted to be reliable under federal and regional regulations, “it is reasonable to say the system would have more margin and better reliability/resiliency had the assets [at North Omaha Station] remained in service with applicable maintenance and life extension work.”
One of the tables Fernandez provided Brandt suggests, based on current OPPD plans, that the agency could hit a wall by 2028 and have consumer demand outpace supply. This includes plans by 2029 to bring on 900 new megawatts in natural gas production. Fernandez indicated OPPD is looking to address the “unprecedented load growth” but faces execution and timing challenges with permitting, supply chains, workforce availability and regulatory approvals.
Hilgers, echoing those challenges, said there is a “world of difference” between planning and what actually will happen with any additional new plants or contracted power coming online.
‘Not in the best interests’
The lawsuit posits that maintaining the status quo in North Omaha could reduce or stabilize OPPD consumer rates for power even as demand increases.
In response to another Brandt question as part of the interim study, Fernandez said delaying the plans by five years could net savings of $36 million with potential revenue growth, or $439 million if delayed by 15 years. He testified in September that keeping the status quo would make for better affordability and enable economic growth for consumers, though “slower progress” toward “net-zero.”

In an Oct. 1 email on additional questions from Storm, Fernandez said the North Omaha Station plan was “primarily based on environmental considerations.”
Brandt repeated that he is unaware of any study or data showing health concerns because of the North Omaha energy production. Fernandez told Storm he had no scientific evidence to the same and that emissions are strictly regulated at the state and federal levels.
While Pillen defended coal production, Hilgers said he might be more open to an alternative, such as moving all of the North Omaha units to natural gas but keeping all five operational. Hilgers said he hopes OPPD comes to the table and that he is open to ideas and a possible settlement.
Brandt, reached Thursday, said: “In a time when the state needs all the generation it can possibly get, it is not in the best interests of the utilities and the state to shut down generation.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)ST. PETERSBURG — Last Saturday morning in South St. Petersburg’s Wildwood Park, 16 members of a group calling itself “Dump Duke” gathered to share strategy before pairing up to canvass in nearby neighborhoods.
They were there to inform residents and ratepayers frustrated about the prices and services provided by Duke Energy that they could do something about it by signing a petition.
The signature drive was part of a grassroots effort to demonstrate to the City of St. Petersburg legitimate interest within the community to seriously explore jettisoning Duke — their longtime energy provider — when the 30-year franchise agreement between the two parties expires next summer.
“It’s one of the easiest things to canvas for,” said Dump Duke organizer Marley Price, comparing it to her experience knocking on doors last year for an unsuccessful candidate for St. Pete City Council.
“With Duke, everyone knows them. Most people have had a bad experience with them, so it’s really to relate that back and tell them something new — that it doesn’t have to be that way.”
Those and earlier efforts have spurred several members of the City Council to take up the idea. The board voted, 5-3, in August to call on Mayor Ken Welch to seek bids for a feasibility study evaluating the pros and cons of leaving Duke and forming a municipal utility, something that 33 other communities now operate in Florida.
Consultant study
That early vote came as Pinellas County’s next largest city — Clearwater — has received its own, long-anticipated feasibility study prepared by NewGen Strategies & Solutions about what would happen if that city ended its relationship with Duke Energy, whose franchise agreement expires at the end of this year.
Projecting a 30-year period beginning in 2026, the report concluded that if the city dropped Duke Energy, its effective rates over the next five years would end up approximately 7% lower on average than the Duke rate on an annualized basis. After that, the effective rate would run approximately 18% lower on average than the Duke rate for the remainder of the 30-year period.
The study values the cost of acquiring Duke property at $572 million but also notes that the real cost of Duke’s assets could run between 50% lower or 100% higher than its estimate — meaning around $1 billion. That was the estimate offered by an outside energy consultant hired by Duke Energy of Clearwater’s costs.
In Florida, 54 utilities provide electricity to residents. They include the big four investor-owned providers — Duke Energy Florida, Florida Power & Light, Florida Public Utilities, and Tampa Electric Co. (TECO). Those four serve approximately 75% of the state’s population, with the remaining 25% provided by 33 municipal electric utilities and 16 rural electric cooperatives, according to the Florida Municipal Electric Association.
While it would be convenient if an investor-owned utility sold its private assets to a public entity, it never works that way. If Clearwater municipalizes its electric utility, it would have to go the eminent domain route — by far the most expensive option, as Duke officials have been explicit in stressing that they have no intention of selling their system.
“We know it’s going to be a fight and it’s going to take time,” said Clearwater City Council member David Albritton after the board approved the study. “It’s a risk. We all know that. But it could be a lower rate.”
The NextGen study is loaded with caveats, however, including an explicit statement that “there can be no guarantee that Clearwater … will achieve cost savings.”
Winter Park’s success
Some of Florida’s largest communities, such as Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee, have run their own municipal utilities for decades, but not a single one has launched since Winter Park, a northern suburb of Orlando, did so in 2005. That took place following a referendum approved by 69% of the electorate in 2003.
Randy Knight, city manager for Winter Park, described recently on the Florida City and County Management Association podcast how its municipal utility has buried 80% of its power lines underground over the past 20 years, which “has been just huge in reliability … and not having storm outages at all has been fantastic.”
“In this last storm, we had 271 customers out of power after the hurricane came through, and had all of that restored in 12 hours,” he said (the Winter Park municipality serves approximately 15,000 customers). “None of those outages were in the underground part of the system … . It was a testament to what we were doing was the right thing and, you know, the community loves that.”
“As of May, our rates were 32% lower than Duke Energy’s and 2% lower than the statewide average for municipal utilities,” Knight added to WKMG television in August.
Nationally, the last local community to form its own electric utility was the Jefferson County Public Utility District in Washington state in 2013.
Boulder’s decade-long experiment 
There is no greater example of how hard it can be to break away from an investor-owned utility than what happened in Boulder, Colorado, which spent nearly a decade trying to break away from Xcel Energy. That effort ended in 2020 when voters approved a settlement with Xcel to trigger the reinstatement of a franchise agreement abandoned a decade earlier.

“Be rational,” suggests former Boulder City Council member Bob Yates, when asked what words of advice he would give Clearwater and St. Petersburg council members who support municipalization efforts. “Be objective and clear-eyed about your evaluation, not only of your goals and objectives, but also how long it will take and how much it will cost.”
In the case of Boulder, taxpayers approved $29 million for the losing effort. Yates says that when investor-owned utilities decide to fight, they won’t give up easily.
Boulder residents pushed the local government to separate from Xcel because of frustration with the lack of urgency the power company expended in pursuing electricity from green power sources like wind and solar.
Yates, who served on the Boulder City Council from 2015 to 2023, said that while he personally never supported the effort, he wishes Pinellas County lawmakers the best of luck. “I don’t think it was a good use of time or money, but the situation may be very different in Florida, so I wouldn’t want to presume to tell the good folks of Florida how to handle their affairs,” he said.
Ursula Schryver is senior vice president for education, training, and events for the American Public Power Association, a D.C. trade group representing the nation’s 2,000 public power utilities. While there is a sense of urgency with the impending end of the franchise agreements in Clearwater and St. Petersburg, it’s generally “a long process and requires a lot of commitment on the part of the community and leadership and so forth,” she said.

The end of a franchise agreement doesn’t mean the end of service
St. Petersburg Mayor Welch, who at one point in his career worked as an accountant with the old Florida Power Corp., has suggested establishing a new 10-year agreement with Duke next year to ensure that residents could rely on “stable and dependable services” as the future of energy in the city is debated. But Schryver says that rather than signing a shorter franchise agreement, “now’s the time” for the city to begin negotiating its wants and needs.
“They have to continue serving the community — Duke or whomever the incumbent is has to continue to serve the community, even without a franchise agreement,” she said. “I would suggest negotiating and continuing to look at the option of forming a public power utility without signing that franchise agreement vs. signing a five-year one and then you’re going to be in the same place that you’re in now, five years down the line.”
That’s what the city of Tampa did during the aughts. After its 20-year franchise agreement with TECO expired in 2006, the city spent two years negotiating with the utility before signing a new 25-year agreement in 2008.
St. Petersburg City Council member Richie Floyd says the fact that the city’s franchise agreement is scheduled to end next year gives the city “a once-in-a-generation opportunity to look into the city’s options.”
“It’s not a radical idea or anything, although I think it’s an important one,” he said.
St. Petersburg City Council member Brandi Gabbard is also enthusiastic about pursuing municipal power.
“What the residents are asking of us is for us to really be able to control costs and to be able to give them a level of service that they are demanding, and so I think that we need to listen to our residents,” she said. “We need to explore it. I’ve been very honest with residents that I don’t have a crystal ball. I don’t know what the future holds.”
Gabbard expressed dissatisfaction that the city hadn’t as of early October even set a timeline for sending out the request for proposals for a consultant study. “There’s no guarantees that this is actually going to come to fruition, but for us to drag our feet and not respond the way that residents are asking us to, I think is doing a disservice.”
Orlando Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani argues that having a local utility through which residents can exercise direct influence “is always preferable to relying on the Public Service Commission as your advocate.”
“Most constituents don’t even know the Public Service Commission exists, but having a local utility board that you can present to, engage with, and really influence leads to better consumer experiences,” she said.
After the Clearwater City Council voted to begin a formal reappraisal of Duke’s distribution system, Duke said in a written statement that creating a city-owned electric utility would be “enormously expensive, risky, and take years to complete.”
“As we have said before, our system is not for sale. That position has not changed. Duke Energy remains committed to serving our Clearwater and St. Petersburg customers, and we look forward to working with both cities on the best path forward — which we believe is renewing the franchise agreement.”
Facebook ad from the Edison Institute
Pinellas County residents are also being hit by social media ads from “We Stand for Energy,” a campaign created by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), calling on them to “Tell the Council: Don’t Waste Taxpayer Money” by pursuing municipalizing.
“As feasibility studies consistently show, municipalization efforts threaten to increase customer costs by billions of dollars without improving service,” said an EEI spokesperson when asked about the campaign. He declined to respond to a question about how much EEI was investing in the effort.
Meanwhile, Dump Duke advocates say they’re not relenting, although Price concedes it’s discouraging that Mayor Welch has declined to meet with the group.
“Hopefully, there will still be enough public pressure still that they have to do something,” she said.
Saturday, as Dump Duke advocate Jason Scott began knocking on doors in South St. Petersburg, he met a man who said that he used to work for Duke as a lineman but now works across the bay for Tampa Electric.
“What’s your opinion of Duke?” Scott asked him.
“It’s a good company to work for, but I understand that a lot of residents were complaining about high bills and stuff,” the man, who did not want to be identified, responded. “I do understand why.”
When Scott asked him about the cost of his monthly bill, the man quickly jumped in.
“Of course I want cheaper bills, but at the same time that Duke kind of monopolizes everything. I don’t see a way to get out of the situation without it being more expensive.”
Nevertheless, he ended up signing Scott’s petition.

FTC data shows that our state is on pace to exceed last year’s numbers—both in terms of the number of cases and total losses.
Here at the Southern Connecticut Black Chamber of Commerce, some of our business members have been affected by these scams. Whether it is fake invoices, imposter scams from utility companies, phishing scams, or more, the number and type of scams are only growing. Recent reports have even shown that scammers may be targeting elected officials across Washington, D.C., using artificial intelligence to impersonate famous voices.
These scams start on various platforms, including emails, phone calls, or text messages. And the scammers will use any medium possible to steal funds, whether it be cash, retirement accounts, or untraceable cryptocurrency.
Complicating matters further is the fact that most of these scams are not originating stateside. Many are being run by criminal organizations operating beyond our borders, predominantly from Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar. The kicker? Sometimes the scammers are victims themselves, having been trafficked and forced to scam unassuming Americans.

FTC data showing more than $30 million in cyber fraud losses to Connecticut consumers in 2024. 
In the wake of this rise in cyberfraud and scams, warnings from the FBI and State Attorney General William Tong have all made clear that if a number or email you don’t recognize is attempting to contact you, don’t engage.
Education can help give individuals and businesses the tools they need to protect themselves, but unfortunately, it is not enough to keep Americans safe.
Focusing only on technology is also not enough. Last year, some in Washington proposed new regulations on peer-to-peer payment platforms as a way to stop scams. While well-intentioned, these new regulations would have placed new burdens on users of the platforms and let crooks off the hook.
Truly protecting Americans will require a more comprehensive approach.
Fortunately, it appears that Congress recognizes this and is exploring ways to better protect Americans.
In the Senate, a bipartisan bill called the TRAPS Act was recently introduced. The measure, which would create a cross-departmental task force to study the fraud landscape and recommend legislative and regulatory changes, is a step in the right direction. By bringing together public and private stakeholders that are working on these issues daily, the measure recognizes the complexity of fraud and scams and the need to evolve our thinking on how to approach them.
But there are still more steps that Connecticut’s leaders in Washington can take to help protect residents.
Congress can support increased resources for all levels of law enforcement to find and remove scammers from the ecosystem. Leaders can also look abroad at solutions that have worked elsewhere, like the National Anti-Scam Center in Australia or Canada’s anti-spam legislation.
And lastly, our leaders must increase international pressure to shut down foreign scam centers. So long as these centers continue to operate, Americans will be at risk. The only way to eliminate this threat is to root it out at the source, and that begins with criminals.
Education is good, but there is more to do. Our Congressional leaders in Washington must lead the way in stopping this growing threat. The TRAPS Act, better resources for law enforcement, and more international cooperation are all part of a comprehensive strategy that will protect Americans online.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-10 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Teens are talking to AI. It’s time for us to learn,Farrell Lindemann,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/10/teens-are-talking-to-ai-its-time-for-us-to-learn/,"If a chatbot is the first place a teen feels heard, let’s make sure it’s not the last.","“I’m going to tell you something I’ve only ever told AI.”
This summer, as I met one-on-one with girls at Camp LiveGirl, I heard this phrase again and again. Concerned and curious, I immediately began to research this phenomenon.
Here’s what I found: 70% of teens are using generative AI, and about one in three teenshave used AI companions for social interaction and companionship.
These numbers come from a report recently published by Common Sense Media, and while the teens’ use of AI might feel alarming, panic or shame are not the answer. It’s clear that teens will explore these spaces, with or without us. There’s insight here if we pause to listen. This piece unpacks the trend, and ends with concrete guidance for parents who want to support their kids. We need to approach the phenomenon of the AI chatbot with curiosity, education, and connection.
Why AI?
As adults, we recognize developmental milestones for children like rolling over, walking, or talking. But for adolescents, milestones look more like independence, identity, and connecting with peers. Learning new social skills and going through puberty requires some trial and error, and a lot of awkwardness. It’s their job!
For an adolescent, AI can feel like a cheat code for working through the feelings that come with these development tasks. An AI chatbot becomes a low-stakes space to confess, have easy conversation, or ask for advice. The numbers back this up- 14% say they turn to AI chatbots because they “don’t judge.”
But while technology can be helpful in the moment, it cannot replace the human connection that drives real emotional development. Only about 39% of teens report applying skills they practice with AI to real-life situations. While a chatbot can listen instantly, it cannot teach social skills and provide the warmth of human empathy.
Feedback requiredWith AI, there is no real feedback. AI chatbots are sycophants. They are designed to validate, not to challenge. This is a point that many of my savvy students had already picked up on in their AI chats. In human conversation, body language and verbal communication provide dynamic feedback. This helps adolescents learn social skills and create a good decision-making system. In a conversation with AI, where there are only affirmations and validation, advice can go in a dangerous direction.
Privacy risksTeens also need to understand the privacy risks of treating AI like a therapist. Unlike a private journal, conversations with chatbots are stored by the companies that own them and, in some cases, may be reviewed by staff, or disclosed through legal processes. “Confessions” typed late at night don’t disappear into the void —they live on servers owned by corporations. That means when teens pour their hearts into AI, they’re handing over their most vulnerable thoughts to a system that was never designed to protect them the way a trusted human adult can.
The human superpower teens still needParents, teachers, and mentors can use this moment not just to educate teens about AI, but to open the door to deeper conversations. However, 49% of parents say they have not talked to their teens about generative AI. We should teach AI literacy the same way we teach media literacy. In order to create a safe human environment for our teens’ emotions, we must create a place where they can talk about their AI use, and learn about the impact, without shame.
After talking about AI, a parent could ask, “When you’re feeling down, who do you feel safe talking to?” “What helps you feel safe to share with me or your friends?” The goal is to create a space with trusted adults in their life where they can share the same confessions, questions, and bids for connection they felt safe sharing with AI.
When your teen comes to you with a big topic or asks a taboo question, respond with curiosity instead of judgment. The love you have for your child is the human superpower no chatbot can ever replace.
If AI is the first step, let humans be the nextTeens will keep experimenting with AI. The question isn’t whether to ban it, it’s whether we can respond by providing them with trusted adults in their life who can educate and support them. As they grow through all the changes of adolescence, let us surround them with human feedback, privacy, and loving connection.
What can you do? In addition to starting conversations with your teens around AI, you can introduce your daughter to a program like SHE CARES, where she can connect to a personal mentor. Through LiveGirl’s SHE CARES mentoring program, girls in middle school through college are paired with trained adults who listen without judgment and provide steady, supportive guidance. The program is entirely virtual and free, ensuring that every young woman has access to a safe human connection when she needs it most.
And here’s the good news: when young people have a trusted adult in their corner, the impact is profound. Let’s continue to provide them with nonjudgmental adults in schools, at home, and in our communities.
If a chatbot is the first place a teen feels heard, let’s make sure it’s not the last.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)A Prince George’s County Council committee advanced the nomination Thursday of Samuel Moki to be lead the county’s Department of the Environment, largely brushing aside concerns that he had been terminated from a job at the agency about a decade ago.
The 3-1 vote, with one abstention, by the council’s Transportation, Infrastructure, Energy and Environment Committee, came after about three hours of passionate testimony from supporters, including a host of current department employees who said Moki has been a capable and personable leader in several months as acting director.
While a number of community and environmental advocates testified against the nomination, citing Moki’s checkered past as a former associate director at the department, the majority of committee members did not appear convinced that his past termination should disqualify him.
A few expressed concern that Moki might have taken the fall for larger problems with stormwater management at the agency during the 2010s when he was let go.
“The way I see it, there was some scapegoating that happened 10 years ago,” said District 6 Councilmember Wala Blegay.
District 3 Councilmember Eric Olson voted no Thursday and District 1 Councilmember Tom Dernoga abstained. The nomination now goes to the full 11-member council, which is expected to take it up later this month.

Moki was nominated in June by County Executive Aisha Braveboy, who has remained a vocal supporter after it was revealed that he had been terminated from the county government for cause in 2014. That firing — which was upheld by the county personnel board, a county circuit court and the state’s intermediate appeals court — claimed that Moki mismanaged the county’s stormwater management program, and failed to ensure projects were completed in accordance with federal mandates. The county paid thousands of dollars in stormwater fines during the period around his tenure.
Olson had pointed questions for Moki Thursday. In the court rulings over his termination, “there was no evidence presented by you that any supervisors prevented you from administering the program. I’d like to hear your response to that.”
Moki defended himself in part by denying allegations from the court record — namely that he had access to a stormwater fund that never dipped below $40 million, but failed to use it to complete projects to reduce harmful runoff.
“That’s patently false,” Moki said. “The associate director of the Department of Environment does not have unfettered access to the stormwater fund. Even the director does not.”
He added that the fund had to be split between his department and others, including the Department of Public Works, and that it was not large enough for the county to do all the work needed to remain in compliance with the federal Clean Water Act.
“Even if the county spent all that $40 million on stormwater, it would still not have brought the program into compliance,” Moki said. “The issue that people don’t want to face is: The county underfunded this program. So it’s not on me.”
Moki said that since his appointment in June, he has found a way to trim $31 million from the county’s stormwater budget over the next four years, arguing that the previous budget was not “sustainable.”
At the hearing, Moki also spoke to his detractors directly, saying that he doesn’t shy away from confrontation.
“I make a commitment — irrespective of whether or not you disagree with me — if I’m honored to be given this position, my offices are open for you to come in and discuss,” Moki said. “This is not going to be a war. It is partnership for the interest of the environment.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A parade of current Department of the Environment workers — from Moki’s two deputy directors to administrative assistants — came to testify in support of him Thursday. Several described his affable nature, saying he makes a point of greeting staff and fostering a positive environment, while also making visits to county facilities. Some said they had known him for several years, including during his past stint at the department.
“I believe his heart is special,” said Rodney Taylor, a department associate director. “In my 42 years, he’s the first one I’ve seen that spent this kind of time with his staff.”
David Fisher, an associate director of the department’s animal services division, said Moki made a great impression during two visits to the county animal shelter, including when he came to commend the staff recently after a record monthly “save rate.”
“He says, ‘I came to the facility today so I can congratulate the staff on the work that they did in person, because sending an email didn’t seem like enough to me,’” Fisher said. “I cannot say enough that his leadership is welcome at DoE.”
But some opponents cast doubt on remarks from Moki’s subordinates.
“Most people that got up here have talked about how they’ve interacted with Samuel Moki just over the past few months, and that’s what alarmed me,” said Taylor Frazier McCollum, a community advocate from Landover. “Do you really know him? In my opinion, it’s unethical to have subordinates testify — period.”
Lily Fountain, chair of the executive committee of the Prince George’s County Sierra Club chapters, said her organization is requesting “a new candidate with requisite background and integrity to lead this vital department in these changing times.”
Environmental advocate Staci Hartwell, who currently serves as a strategic adviser for the South County Environmental Justice Coalition, expressed frustration that Moki did not work in environmental fields after his dismissal. He testified that he completed a master’s degree in environmental management in 2016, and later taught policy courses at local institutions.

“We need a candidate with a clear record of professional excellence — not controversy — and competitive, relevant experience, not a decade-long industry-related leadership gap,” Hartwell said.
Others expressed concern that Moki’s appointment could cause county environmental gains to backslide,. Cheverly resident Dan Smith argued that stormwater failures in Moki’s earlier tenure were damaging.
“We lost ground because of what occurred at that period,” Smith said. “We cannot afford to lose any more ground.”
Sherman Hardy, representing Citizens for Accountability in Governance, argued that the Moki nomination damages public trust in the county’s government.
“Today, I have the painful task of asking whether my government has lost its moral footing or its mind,” Hardy said. “What we are witnessing with this nomination is not just wrong-headed, it’s malpractice.”
But Moki defender Joe Gaskins, representing the Maryland Business-Clergy Partnership and the Prince George’s Contractors and Business Association, said Moki’s “resume is envious.”
“I’m hoping that the individuals in this room will get over this, what I see as racism, discrimination on this guy,” Gaskins said.
That was echoed by Council Vice Chair Krystal Oriadha, who is not a member of the committee but attended part of Thursday’s hearing. She applauded Braveboy for appointing Moki and refusing to be “bullied or manipulated” by opponents, specifically those “behind the scenes that don’t look like me or you.”
“I just see a lot of things that I’m really sad about, in this case, as a Black woman, as a woman of an immigrant father from Africa,” Oriadha said.
Moki spoke briefly about his own experience as an immigrant and naturalized citizen, an experience he said left him with a “with a strong desire to enter public service.”
Oriadha argued that stormwater fines against the county “continued to increase” after Moki’s dismissal.
“A lot of times, blame is left at the feet of people that are not the ones making the decision,” she said. “And we have to be mindful of that. And I find it kind of hypocritical that the person that was in charge of the agency wasn’t made responsible.”
Councilmember Wala Blegay said Samuel Moki has been responsive in his few months as acting director of the Department of the Environment. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)
Blegay credited Moki for jumping in to help with stormwater problems in her district, which includes Largo and Upper Marlboro, after she struggled to get assistance from the previous administration.
“He brought his whole team to my office, and they started talking about possible goals,” Blegay said. “We have resolution now, because of Dr. Moki.”
District 2 Councilmember Wanika Fisher, who is also an attorney, implied that politics may have been at play in Moki’s 2014 dismissal.
“There are two sides of the truth,” Fisher said. “That’s one thing I know for sure, being in courtrooms in this county for the last 10 years — and there are politics in every aspect of our judicial system.”
Dernoga, who abstained Thursday, said he had asked for particular documents from Moki and received them Thursday morning. He said he planned to review the documents and come to a “more solid position” by the time the full council votes, but he called the concerns about Moki’s past “valid.”
District 9 Councilmember Sydney Harrison also appeared ready to abstain, saying he wanted to “reserve any thought that I have to learn more and to understand more.” But he ultimately voted for the nomination.
“I do not know how I’m going to vote when you come before the entire council, but it’s going to give me more opportunities to learn,” Harrison said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC07068-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-09 23:56:42.481706

U.S. District Judge April Perry noted the ongoing protests outside a local immigration processing center have never exceeded 200 demonstrators. She said the demonstrations fall far short of the high legal bar needed to be characterized as a “rebellion” that would allow the administration to take control of the Illinois National Guard and deploy troops from Texas and California to Chicago.
“I have seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” the judge said as she issued her oral ruling late Thursday afternoon.
While Perry acknowledged protesters have assaulted immigration agents and damaged federal property — namely vehicles belonging to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Border Patrol — the judge said there was far more evidence that the feds actually escalated or even caused clashes with activists.
More than a dozen protestors have been arrested in recent weeks outside an ICE processing center in the suburb of Broadview, approximately 13 miles directly west of Thursday’s hearing in Chicago’s Dirksen Federal Courthouse.
The ICE facility has been the epicenter of protests against the Trump administration’s ramped-up immigration enforcement actions in the last month. The Department of Homeland Security claims “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago and its suburbs has resulted in the arrests of more than 1,000 people.

 National Guard would add ‘fuel to the fire’

DHS claims the federal troop deployment is necessary to protect the facility, along with federal immigration agents working in and around it.
But the judge agreed with arguments put forth by the state and city of Chicago in its lawsuit that deploying the National Guard was more likely to lead to civil unrest than be a force for peacekeeping, as guardsmen are “not trained in de-escalation.” Throughout nearly three hours of arguments in her courtroom, she continually pushed back on U.S. Department of Justice lawyers’ claims that Chicago-area immigration protests had grown out of control due to violent agitators.
Perry noted that for 19 years, weekly prayer vigils outside the Broadview facility occurred without incident. But she said most of the evidence pointed to federal agents — not protesters — as the catalysts for violence. She recounted recent incidents in which agents used chemical agents and nonlethal rounds against crowds “as small as 10 people.”
Deploying the guard “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started,” she said.
The judge will publish a written decision on Friday. But after giving her a verbal ruling Thursday, she agreed to use the widest possible wording to prevent the Trump administration from deploying troops from other states while her 14-day temporary restraining order remains in place.
For now, the feds won’t be able to order troops to perform their “federal protective missions” anywhere in Illinois.
That includes members of the Texas National Guard, who made their first appearance Thursday morning at the Broadview facility.
 Texas Guard is already here

The Trump administration dispatched National Guard troops to Illinois from Texas earlier this week, even after the judge on Monday urged them to wait for Thursday’s hearing. Fourteen members of California’s National Guard were also sent to the Chicago area in order to train Illinois troops. Eric Wells, a top lawyer for Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, argued the move was a harbinger of “wanton tyranny.”
“I can only say that what I think what we heard from the United States Department of Justice was startling, unbounded, limitless and not in accord with our system of ordered liberty of federalism, of a constitutional structure that has protected this nation and allowed it to prosper for hundreds of years,” Wells said as he began his final arguments.
Raoul sat front-row throughout Thursday’s arguments in the courtroom and grew emotional while answering reporter questions after Perry’s ruling. He called the attorneys who worked on the case “true American heroes.”
“This is an important decision not just for the state of Illinois but for the entire country,” he said. “The question of state sovereignty was addressed in this decision. The question of whether or not the president of the United States should have unfettered authority to militarize our cities was answered today.”

 Trump administration to appeal

The Trump administration is poised to appeal Perry’s decision, just as it challenged a decision from Trump-appointed federal judge in Oregon who also blocked the National Guard’s deployment to Portland over the weekend. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday heard the case, during which two other Trump-appointed judges appeared amenable to arguments that a president should be given deference in matters of national security, according to reporting from POLITICO.
DOJ lawyer Eric Hamilton also pushed for deference in his arguments to Perry Thursday. He said it wasn’t up to the judge to decide whether there was a risk of rebellion or even whether Trump was “relying on completely invalid evidence,” as Perry put it.
Hamilton painted a much darker picture of the protests in Broadview and Chicago, claiming that “sustained violence” in recent weeks was preventing DHS from “executing federal law.”
“They are not protesters,” he said. “They are the violent resistance of duly enacted immigration laws.”
Hamilton said dozens of agents have been “injured, hit, punched” — one even had his beard ripped off by a protester, he alleged.
“How — how did that happen?” Perry asked at one point. “Like an entire … not pieces of hair? His whole beard?”
“I believe that’s what the declaration says,” Hamilton said, referring to a filing in the case.
 ‘DHS’ version of events are unreliable’ 

In delivering her ruling, Perry said the DOJ’s arguments in the National Guard case seemed to add to “a growing body of evidence that DHS’ version of events are unreliable.” She said the administration’s characterization of immigration protests “cannot be aligned” with the accounts of local and state law enforcement submitted in legal filings.
For example, Hamilton referenced recent arrests of protesters, including a couple who were arrested for allegedly assaulting officers and happened to be carrying their licensed concealed weapons. But a federal grand jury this week declined to indict the couple, along with a third person, all of whom had already been released on bond.
Over the weekend, a Customs and Border Protection agent shot a woman in Brighton Park on Chicago’s Southwest Side during an altercation with agents. DHS officials allege the woman was one of 10 drivers who were following federal agents’ vehicles Saturday morning and eventually boxed them in.
But her attorney told a federal judge this week that body-camera footage contradicts that narrative and shows an officer shouting “do something b—-,” according to reporting from the Chicago Sun-Times. She and another driver were arrested over the weekend but the judge ordered them released.
Hamilton also referred to the incident several times, claiming drivers were “ramming” into immigration vehicles.
None of the other protesters arrested by either federal or local authorities in recent weeks remain in detention, with most arrestees handcuffed and immediately released after receiving a citation.
Federal prosecutors on Thursday dropped charges against one of the arrested protesters, one day after a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order against ICE barring agents from arresting peaceful protesters or journalists covering immigration demonstrations. It also bars federal agents from using harsh crowd control methods such as tear gas and other non-lethal weapons and ammunition.
The judge pointed out the Trump administration activated the National Guard the same weekend a federal immigration official stationed in Broadview described as a “great weekend” in an internal email late Sunday night. The official said the relative calm was due to the Illinois State Police, which last week formalized cooperation with Broadview Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office into a “unified command” and put up fencing around the building.
Perry cited the dropped charges for protesters this week, the First Amendment restraining order won by journalism groups, and another federal judge’s ruling Tuesday that ICE violated a consent decree restricting warrantless arrests.
“So to summarize, in the last 48 hours, in four separate unrelated legal decisions from four different neutral parties, they all cast doubt on DHS’ version of events,” the judge said.

The data follow National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores released earlier this year in which the Commonwealth’s students scored at a 20-year low. 
Compare these results to the years following passage of a 1993 education reform law that ushered unprecedented improvements in student achievement and came to be known as the “Massachusetts Miracle.” By 2007, the Commonwealth’s eighth graders tied for best in the world on international science testing. 
Now, nearly 15 years into a precipitous decline in educational outcomes, it’s hard not to wonder whether Massachusetts leaders will wait for all the gains from education reform to be wiped out before they do something about it. 
The Education Reform Act combined a significant investment in public education – particularly in less affluent school districts – with high academic standards and accountability for everyone in the system. 
Money is important, but it isn’t the problem here. The Commonwealth’s 2019 Student Opportunity Act adds over $875 million to annual education appropriations, again focused on promoting equity by providing increased funding for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, to what was already one of the nation’s best-funded public-school systems. Massachusetts schools also received nearly $2.3 billion in federal pandemic relief money.  
This year, K-12 public education will receive nearly $500 million in receipts from the tax increase on high earners that state voters approved in 2022. All told, state and local taxpayers are spending about $18 billion on public schools. 
The money is still flowing, but standards and accountability haven’t fared so well. In 2010, Massachusetts jettisoned the nation’s best English language arts and math standards, replacing them with national academic standards known as Common Core that dramatically cut the amount of literature students read and slowed their progression to higher mathematics study. 
On accountability, the Commonwealth eliminated an independent agency that performed comprehensive audits of state school districts in 2008, replacing it with… not much. Last year voters eliminated the requirement that students pass MCAS English, math and science tests to graduate from high school. 
Perhaps education reform’s single biggest success was the Commonwealth’s charter public schools.  Stanford University’s Center for Research on Education Outcomes found that Boston charters performed the best of 41 urban charter sectors it studied.  The Brookings Institution found that Boston’s charter schools achieved some of the largest academic gains ever documented. But charters have been stalled since a bid to increase their number failed at the ballot box in 2016. 
Some charter schools need to get their own houses in order. Performance at too many of them has declined since their embrace of “social justice education.” Such equity-centric programs aren’t, by definition, harmful, but in some charters they have taken the place of delivering the rich liberal arts curriculum that is the surest path to justice.    
Now another education reform success, the Commonwealth’s outstanding vocational-technical schools, are in the crosshairs of reform opponents because they’re drawing more and more students from traditional public high schools.  
The deterioration in performance became clear after the Commonwealth adopted Common Core in 2011. By 2019, Massachusetts NAEP scores fell by more than all but 17 states in math and all but 14 in reading. Then the Commonwealth’s students had among the nation’s largest declines during the pandemic. Rather than recovering at least some of that ground post-pandemic, the decline continues. 
MCAS results reveal that the overall portion of students meeting expectations fell from half before the pandemic to 42 percent now. The portion of students who failed rose from 11 percent to 18 percent.  
Only 39 percent met or exceeded expectations on the just-unveiled 8th-grade civics test.  In these tumultuous political times, the civics results give chilling new meaning to the story of the woman outside the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, who asked Benjamin Franklin, “What have we got, a republic or a monarchy?”  “A republic,” Franklin replied, “if you can keep it.” 
After nearly 15 years of decline, the question is whether things have finally gotten bad enough for state leaders to return to the high standards, accountability, and strategic access to high quality choices that were pillars of the most successful education reform in modern American history.

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (left) and former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger faced off Thursday in the only debate of Virginia’s 2025 gubernatorial race. (Photos by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)After months of deeply polarized campaigning, the tone of political speech and the fallout from the recent controversy over Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones dominated Virginia’s only gubernatorial debate Thursday night at Norfolk State University, where Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears clashed sharply over violence, abortion, taxes, and immigration in an often heated exchange.
Moderators Deanna Albritton of WRIC and Tom Schaad of WAVY frequently had to rein in Earle-Sears, who interrupted Spanberger repeatedly as the two traded barbs before a crowd of  students and invited guests at the historically Black university.
The 60-minute debate, which was televised statewide, was the only face-to-face encounter of the 2025 race for governor — a contest that polls show leaning toward Spanberger. An Emerson College Polling survey released last week found the Democrat leading Earle-Sears by 10 points, 52% to 42%, buoyed by strong support among independents and younger voters.
 Jay Jones controversy and political rhetoric

The debate’s opening segment focused on the scandal engulfing Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones, who admitted sending text messages referencing former Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert in language that both parties have condemned as violent and unacceptable.
Asked whether she knew about the messages before their release — and whether she still endorsed Jones — Spanberger sidestepped direct answers despite repeated follow-ups from the moderators.
“The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent,” Spanberger said. “I denounced them when I learned of them, and I will denounce them every opportunity I get as a mother, as a public servant, as a candidate for governor.”
“My opponent, unfortunately, only denounces violence when her side is the target,” she added, directly addressing Earle-Sears. “You routinely referred to me as your enemy. I’m not your enemy. We are political opponents.”
Pressed again on whether she still endorsed Jones, Spanberger said she learned of the texts only when they became public and added, “It is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information.”
‘Beyond disqualifying’: Jay Jones controversy jolts Virginia’s pivotal 2025 elections

Earle-Sears seized on the moment, accusing Spanberger of lacking “political courage.”
“Jay Jones advocated the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children,” Earle-Sears said. “What if he said it about your three children?” she asked Spanberger directly. “I’m asking my opponent to please ask Jay Jones to get out of the race.”
She invoked her upbringing in Jamaica, saying she had witnessed political violence as a child and did not want to “see that in America.”
When moderators turned to President Donald Trump’s remarks at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, where Trump said, “I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them,” Earle-Sears said she would not use such language but pivoted again to the Jones case.
“As everybody knows, I’m a Christian before I’m a Republican,” she said. “I’m required to forgive people. … But I would not say that.”
Spanberger countered that Earle-Sears herself refused to condemn violent rhetoric from her own party.
“The statement you read from President Donald Trump was violent rhetoric that she refuses to denounce,” Spanberger said, addressing the moderators.
The exchanges underscored how the controversy over Jones has reshaped the final stretch of Virginia’s election season. As The Mercury reported earlier this week, Democratic leaders have struggled to contain fallout from the texts, which Republicans have used to portray the party as divided and hypocritical on civility and accountability.
Political analyst David Richards, a professor at the University of Lynchburg, said the issue dominated the night to Earle-Sears’ detriment.
“Earle-Sears was not doing herself any favors tonight,” Richards said afterward. “Her constant interruptions seemed desperate and frankly unbecoming. She played the Jay Jones card over and over, which got old.”
 Clash on reproductive rights

The sharpest policy divide of the evening came over abortion.
Earle-Sears reiterated her support for new limits, saying she would sign legislation banning abortion after 15 weeks, possibly earlier, depending on what “the majority of Virginians decide.” 
“It’s not going to be my view,” she said. “My opponent, on the other hand, has the extremist view, which is abortion up until the very hour that the baby could be born.”
Earle-Sears ‘morally opposed’ to Virginia’s reproductive rights amendment, note shows

Spanberger pushed back, accusing her opponent of mischaracterizing her position.
“When the Dobbs decision was made, it was very quickly clear that state after state would move to restrict abortion access,” she said. “In states where they further restricted abortion access, women have died. I support the constitutional amendment codifying the Roe v. Wade standard.”
The amendment, which would enshrine abortion rights in Virginia’s constitution and which Earle-Sears wrote that she is “morally opposed” to, is expected to appear on the ballot in 2026 after the next General Assembly cycle if lawmakers approve it a second time — an issue both candidates said will define the next governor’s term.
 Taxes and affordability

Earle-Sears leaned heavily on fiscal themes, promising to eliminate Virginia’s car tax in her first year and claiming the state has “run budget surpluses every year” under Republican leadership.
“We could have gotten rid of that this year, because Governor Youngkin put it in his budget,” she said. “We had the money. We can do it.”
Earle-Sears did not answer directly when moderators asked how she would replace the $2 billion the car tax generates for the state each year. 
Spanberger agreed the car tax is unpopular but said her opponent’s record doesn’t match her rhetoric.
On the record: Abigail Spanberger

“My opponent went in the legislature and had the opportunity to lower the car tax by 10% and voted against it,” she said, referring to the Republican’s tenure in the House of Delegates from 2002 to 2004. “Now, in the four years that she has been lieutenant governor, she hasn’t made the effort to get rid of this tax.”
Spanberger added that any repeal must protect funding for public schools and local services — an argument echoing Democratic criticism of tax-cut proposals advanced by Youngkin that critics said would strain local budgets.
 Education and parental involvement

Education policy, long a centerpiece of Virginia politics, drew another spirited exchange.
Earle-Sears repeated her campaign line that “parents are their child’s first teachers” and that she does not “co-parent with the government.”
Spanberger, a mother of three daughters in public schools, struck a similar tone on parental engagement but defended educators’ role in shaping curricula.
“Parents’ engagement is extraordinarily important,” she said. “And I support the strength of our public schools because they provide opportunities for students everywhere.”
The candidates’ agreement ended when the topic turned to transgender students’ rights. Spanberger declined to take a definitive position on whether transgender girls should use girls’ bathrooms or play on girls’ teams, saying localities should decide.
Earle-Sears said she would uphold Youngkin’s 2022 policy requiring students to use bathrooms aligned with their assigned sex at birth.
“I’m not for discriminating against anyone,” she said. “Girls want to have privacy. It’s really that simple.”
 Immigration and law enforcement

The debate later shifted to immigration and public safety, a frequent flashpoint during Earle-Sears’ tenure as lieutenant governor. 
She backed Youngkin’s directive for Virginia State Police to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in removing undocumented immigrants, saying violent offenders must be prioritized.
Spanberger vows to scrap Youngkin’s immigration order if elected governor

“We have found cartel members here, communist Chinese gangs here,” Earle-Sears said. “They’re here because my opponent did not vote to shut down our borders.”
Spanberger, a former CIA officer and former member of Congress, rejected Earle-Sears’ claim and emphasized that she supports law enforcement cooperation when a valid warrant or criminal charge exists.
“Anytime there is someone wanted for a criminal offense, absolutely that cooperation shouldn’t just occur — it must,” she said.
Her law-and-order framing aligned with her broader effort to position herself as a pragmatic Democrat focused on safety and stability, in contrast to what she called “partisan chaos” in Washington.
 Contrasting biographies and tones

The debate also showcased the stark personal contrasts between the two women.
Spanberger, 46, served three terms in Congress representing Virginia’s 7th District before announcing last year she would run for governor. 
A former CIA operations officer, she built a reputation as a centrist focused on bipartisanship and pragmatic problem-solving. Her campaign has emphasized lowering costs, protecting abortion rights and investing in workforce training.
Earle-Sears, 61, made history in 2021 as Virginia’s first Black woman elected statewide. 
A U.S. Marine Corps veteran, she previously served one term in the House of Delegates and on the State Board of Education. She launched her gubernatorial bid in 2024 pledging to continue Youngkin’s conservative policies on taxes, education and social issues.
Richards, the Lynchburg political scientist, said their temperaments reflected those records.
“Spanberger held her own and came off as much more polished and capable, if not a little cold,” he said. “Earle-Sears often came across as slightly unhinged.”
He added that both candidates dodged tough questions.
“Neither candidate wanted to answer questions directly,” Richards said. “The hosts tried to keep them on target, but were ineffective. This debate probably didn’t change too many people’s minds.”
 Moments of civility

In one of the few lighter moments, both candidates were asked what they admired about the other. Spanberger praised Earle-Sears’ faith and her service in prison ministry.
“I admire her service to our country, particularly as someone who chose to be an American and chose to serve,” the Democrat said.
Earle-Sears responded by calling Spanberger “a devoted mom” and “a daughter who loves her parents very much,” before crossing the stage to shake her opponent’s hand — a rare gesture in a campaign marked by mutual distrust.
 Closing messages

In her closing statement, Earle-Sears returned to her biography.
“I ran a men’s prison ministry. I’ve mopped the floors of a homeless shelter. I’ve given my life to service,” she said. “I’m a United States Marine. I know how to defend and deliver for Virginia.”
On the record: Winsome Earle-Sears

Spanberger’s closing remarks emphasized steadiness and bipartisanship.
“I served as a federal agent at CIA and then in Congress, I always endeavored to put Virginians first,” she said. “My opponent has not done the same, putting her allegiance to Donald Trump first, no matter the cost.”
With less than four weeks until Election Day, analysts say Spanberger enters the final stretch with momentum but faces an energized conservative base. Early voting is already underway across Virginia.
Whether the Norfolk debate swayed undecided voters remains unclear. 
“Earle-Sears’ attempts to drag Spanberger into the Jay Jones scandal were unsuccessful. Overall, I’d give Spanberger a small edge because she seemed calmer and more professional,” Richards said.

(Photo provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Three days after President Donald Trump signed an order approving federal permits for a proposed mining road through the Brooks Range, the U.S. Congress put the finishing touch on a resolution intended to further aid the Ambler Road project.
In a 50-46 vote on Thursday, the U.S. Senate approved a resolution that overturns the Biden administration’s decision to enact a land management plan for Interior Alaska that would have limited development in order to encourage the growth of declining caribou herds, salmon, dall sheep and other wildlife.
That vote followed one in early September by the U.S. House of Representatives. The resolution now goes to Trump’s desk, and the president is expected to sign it.
The Central Yukon Resource Management Plan was the result of a 10-year project to determine how 13.3 million acres of federal land in Interior Alaska should be used, including public access for subsistence and recreation, as well as opportunities for development. But the final result dissatisfied members of Alaska’s congressional delegation and Alaskans who favor mining and resource development, including Doyon Ltd., the regional Alaska Native corporation for Interior Alaska.
Those opponents worried that the plan would hamper projects like the 211-mile Ambler Road, which is intended to connect the Dalton Highway with potential mine sites in the Brooks Range. They also expressed concern that the plan could derail construction of the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.
Environmental groups praised the plan, noting that local residents and Alaska Native tribes participated in shaping the result.
Opponents urged the delegation to seek the repeal of the plan, and Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, introduced a resolution to do so. Begich guided it through the House and on to the Senate, where it was supported by Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska.
“The Biden administration’s Central Yukon Resource Management Plan was an egregious case of federal overreach and just one of the administration’s 70 executive orders and actions singularly focused on harming Alaska, our economy, and our working families,” Sullivan said in a written statement. “This particular scheme effectively locked up millions of acres of Alaska’s land, ignored Alaska Native voices, undermined long-standing federal law, and blocked access to critical mineral, energy, gravel, and material resources that our local communities, state and nation need.”
Murkowski said that reopening the plan for additional changes will allow the Bureau of Land Management “to develop a more balanced plan.”
“I expect a new final plan to address long-standing access issues, provide greater opportunity for economic development, including key energy and mineral resources, and ensure Alaska Native landowners in the region can maximize the use of their own lands while still protecting subsistence and conserving where truly necessary,” she said in a statement.
Begich said he is “proud to see this legislation head to the President’s desk and grateful for the work of Senator Murkowski and Senator Sullivan to get this across the finish line as we continue to unlock Alaska’s resource potential.”
Environmental groups denounced the decision, with the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society saying that the delegation acted incorrectly.
“The existing plan was vital for both the people in the region and the salmon, caribou and Dall sheep that will suffer if migration routes are cut off and habitat isn’t protected,” said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director of the Center for Biological Diversity. “Our Alaska delegation should stop selling out our communities and public lands to out-of-state corporations that just want to plunder our state for profit.”

In a complaint filed Friday and a motion for summary judgment on Monday, the Legislature’s contracted attorney asks a Juneau Superior Court judge to decide whether or not a governor may issue an executive order during a special legislative session.
The lawsuit had been expected for months.
In August, Dunleavy issued an order seeking to create an Alaska Department of Agriculture, shortly before lawmakers convened for a special session called by the governor. Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, and Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, rejected the validity of the order.
Representatives for the governor’s office said they believed the order was valid and that it would take effect unless lawmakers voted it down. 
The leaders of the House and Senate said they did not want to take up the order, because doing so risked setting a precedent, effectively declaring that executive orders could be issued during a special session.
The question that could be decided in court is whether issuing an order in a special session is legal. And does it matter if the order is identical to one that’s already been issued and voted upon?
Legislators rejected a similarly written executive order in March, saying they wanted to create a new Department of Agriculture via legislation instead, during the regular legislative session.
Alaska is one of two states without a cabinet-level Department of Agriculture, and creating one is seen as a key first step for boosting food production in Alaska.
“The parties require the court’s prompt assistance to resolve this legal dispute before January 1, 2026,” wrote attorney Kevin Cuddy. “Otherwise, there is a risk that the state will move forward with a Department of Agriculture that may have been unconstitutionally created, and thus without legal authority to act.”
The Alaska Department of Law, which will represent the governor in the case, has been served with the lawsuit but has not yet filed its reply. 
Patty Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Department of Law, said by email, “We are working on a briefing schedule with the counsel for the Legislature and the court. Our goal is to expedite the case and ensure that a decision is made before the legislative session begins.”
Alaska’s constitution forbids lawsuits by the executive branch against the legislative branch; the inverse is not true. Lawmakers have now sued Dunleavy four times since he took office in 2018.
The Alaska Supreme Court decided two of those cases — dealing with funding education in advance and voting on a governor’s appointees — in Dunleavy’s favor. A third case, dealing with the handling of oil and gas tax settlements, has yet to be decided.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/240128-State-of-the-State3-copy-e1760057961391-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-09 21:56:52.251477

Last week, state officials said the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, had just one to two weeks’ worth of funding to keep feeding low-income Washingtonians. The Department of Health encouraged enrollees to continue using their benefits as usual. 
The newfound money is coming from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, not the state, the Department of Health said. But it was not immediately clear how much money the federal government was providing, or where it was being funneled from.
The Trump administration has said in recent days that it would use revenue from tariffs to keep the program running while the government is shut down. The White House and the U.S. Department of Agriculture didn’t respond to requests for comment late Thursday, with email autoreplies from spokespeople saying that the shutdown was disrupting reply times.   
Even with the additional funding, Washington has seen the temporary closure of a WIC clinic, at Tri-Cities Community Health, said Nicole Flateboe, executive director of Nutrition First, the state’s WIC association. Two other clinics temporarily closed and then reopened. Another could close in a couple weeks. Yet another furloughed staff and stopped taking new clients.
Money for the program flows from the federal government to the state and then some of it to the clinics, which provide WIC services and help to get people enrolled in the program. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds the program, while the state Department of Health administers it in Washington. WIC participants can purchase food using electronic benefit transfer cards, which work like debit cards.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pledged to make back payments once the shutdown ends. But the state has not, Flateboe said. And the expenses are too big for some of the clinics to take on without a guarantee they’ll be made whole. 
Other states are guaranteeing the payments.
“This is only Washington. This is incredibly embarrassing,” Flateboe said Thursday. “We’re the outlier.”
Nutrition First is pushing Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson to allow the state Department of Health to adjust the state’s contracts with the clinics to ensure reimbursement. A spokesperson for the governor didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In Washington, over 200 clinics serve more than 212,000 women and their children under 5 years old annually under the WIC program, according to the state. WIC helps nearly one-third of all newborn babies. Nationally, the program serves nearly 7 million Americans.
WIC helps mothers with access to healthy food, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and health screenings. Research has shown participation in the program helps limit low birth weights and reduce maternal mortality. 
The extra money announced Thursday only covers food benefits, not WIC’s other services.
The federal government shutdown began Oct. 1, with Democrats and Republicans at odds over whether to extend tax credits as part of stopgap funding legislation.  
A shutdown at the start of the federal fiscal year, like this one, is particularly challenging for WIC, as states have little funding left over and haven’t received funding for the new year.

The nearly 30,000 people who use the program in King County already have a safety net. The local health department said this week it would issue one-time vouchers for food and baby formula to current clients through a partnership with Safeway if funding runs out. 
The county also said it would temporarily cover grant costs for its WIC staff. 
About 50 employees at the state health department were temporarily laid off or had their hours reduced starting Monday due to the shutdown.

June 10, 2025. (Courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) OMAHA — The Douglas County sheriff announced Thursday that he wants to contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold migrant detainees at Omaha’s largest local jail, offering reasons including that it would bring in funds to boost his department’s trimmed budget.
The overture was rebuffed by the head of the County Board, which also oversees the jail as the Board of Corrections. Board Chair Roger Garcia, an outspoken critic of ICE tactics, responded in a brief statement that the board had not been involved in related conversations with Sheriff Aaron Hanson.

Garcia said he does not anticipate the board entertaining an ICE contract “any time in the foreseeable future.”
The authority to bring forth an agenda item to the Board of Commissioners or Corrections of the state’s most populated county lies with the board chair (Garcia) or a four-commissioner majority.
 Money source

Hanson, in his statement, said he has urged the County Board to reconsider entering into a detention agreement with ICE. Attached was an Oct. 7 memorandum addressed to Garcia and Vice Chair Mike Friend, which noted in part that nearly 80 workers detained in a June 10 Omaha immigration raid were transported to the Lincoln County jail in North Platte, which is more than four hours away.
Hanson said that, for those individuals, a Douglas County-ICE detention contract could have meant staying nearer to loved ones, with “real, in-person access to legal representation” and access to Omaha’s “premier healthcare system, legal and support services.”
Furthermore, Hanson said, an ICE detention contract would result in “millions of dollars of much-needed revenue.” He said his department’s proposed budget was trimmed by nearly a half-million dollars and said the safety of county residents will suffer.
Hanson’s proposal comes as the State of Nebraska is transforming a McCook-based state prison facility into a nearly 300-bed Midwest hub for ICE detainees. That proposal, backed by Gov. Jim Pillen and several state legislators, has sparked controversy and opposition from various organizations and some lawmakers.
“Ultimately we cannot control what the federal government does,” Hanson wrote to county commissioners. “What we can control is retaining our neighbors and shared constituents within our community as they navigate their due process.”
He contends the county jail is operating at “historic low capacity” and that space exists to “keep our neighbors in our community.”
 LULAC’s role

Hanson’s statement also announced that his office and the LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) Nebraska, had started discussions on “humane and accountable detention practices.”

The sheriff said that while his office and LULAC Nebraska hold different perspectives on whether the county should enter into a detention agreement with ICE, their dialogue “reflects a commitment to transparency and community input.”
Elsa Aranda, LULAC Nebraska state director, said she has offered to help develop independent oversight structures and detainee support frameworks to ensure fairness.
However, national LULAC spokesman David Cruz told the Nebraska Examiner that the sheriff’s statement was “premature” and that “any inference that LULAC is either supporting or endorsing or approving such a project would be inaccurate.”
He said the civil rights organization’s national leadership did not approve “a public statement using the name of LULAC in such a context.” LULAC describes itself as the largest and oldest Hispanic and Latin-American civil rights organization in the U.S.
Three months after Omaha raid: One ICE detention chapter winds down, another heats up

Cruz said LULAC’s national president Ramon Palomares and advisor Hector Flores did speak with Hanson and his chief deputy at a conference they all attended in Dallas — as the sheriff wrote in his memo to the County Board.
But he said that the LULAC representatives did not know beforehand the topic to be discussed. “They went and listened,” he said, and said they’d take it back to the organization’s attorneys. 
Aranda, in remarks included in the sheriff’s statement, said her role as Nebraska state director was “to ensure that if detention occurs, it happens under humane, fair and transparent conditions – and that the rights and dignity of every person are protected, just as the sheriff is proposing.”
Cruz, however, said the national network’s stance is “staunch” opposition to detention centers for “detainees who are being held on immigration-related issues.” He added, “Any use of the name LULAC or the appearance lending weight to this decision would be inaccurate.”

Ford/Maryland Matters)Early childhood education operators Michelle Lloyd and Cindi Webb appreciated that Maryland State Department of Education officials provided updates on various initiatives Thursday, but they still didn’t get an answer to their question.
When will the enrollment freeze on the state’s child care scholarships program be lifted?
The state stopped accepting new families in May, when demand threatened to bust the budget for the program that provides financial assistance to working, income-limited families for child care. When they paused the program, state officials said they expected it to be reopened by the start of the school year, but that has not happened.
“The freeze is affecting children and learning. It’s affecting families being able to go to work,” said Lloyd, president of the Baltimore County Family Child Care Association.
She and Webb joined about 213 other participants — about 40 of whom were logged online — Thursday at the Maryland State Child Care Association’s leadership symposium in Columbia.
The child care scholarship was top of mind because owners, directors and administrators are worried that without it being available for new families, it could force some child care centers to restructure their operations.
Or worse: shut their doors.

But Sarah Neville-Morgan, assistant superintendent in the state Department of Education’s Division of Early Childhood, tried to calm the nerves of attendees. She said the number of children enrolled decreased to 43,000 last month, down from more than 45,000 in June.
“We still haven’t got down below the 40,000 that we need to get to, to stay within the budget,” Neville-Morgan said. “We would love to have more [money], increase us. We’d all be happy, but we know Maryland has other needs.”
She also noted the uncertainty surrounding the federal government, especially in terms of funding and the ongoing government shutdown.
Concerns about the impact of changes at the federal level were echoed by several of the state delegates who showed up for the symposium.
“We are waiting on pins and needles to see what daily calamities befall us from Washington,” said Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), one of eight delegates who came to Columbia to be part of a panel at the event.
“I do not see a huge appetite this year, certainly from our partners across the street in the Senate, to make any additional, sort of radical budget changes,” he said. “I think this is probably a status quo year [in the 2026 legislature].”
Despite likely fiscal challenges, lawmakers said they will still try to reopen enrollment on child care scholarships. A joint virtual briefing on the program is scheduled for Oct. 30 with the House Ways and Means Committee and Appropriations’ Education and Economic Development Subcommittee.
House Ways and Means chair Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard) said that finding “a structured end to the freeze” would be one of the main focuses in the 2026 session.
One statistic highlighted: An estimated 245,000 children are eligible for the scholarship, but only 14% are currently being served.
“We have a ways go to,” said Shavon Williams, customer service coordinator for the scholarship program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The scholarship program was not the only early childhood topic mentioned. Atterbeary said the mixed-delivery system that aims to expand prekindergarten in both public schools and for private providers, as part of the state’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan, is “still not working.”
Lawmakers this year passed House Bill 1475, sponsored by Del. Jessica Feldmark (D-Howard). The law established a 12-member prekindergarten system analysis work group tasked with assessing the mixed-delivery system. The group is scheduled to hold its second meeting Oct. 16.
“For that to work, private providers have to want to participate. It has to be worthwhile for them to participate. We have to make it desirable for them to participate, and we have not done so,” Feldmark said.
Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who serves as vice chair of Ways and Means, offered some advice, especially with the House “prioritizing the child care industry next legislative session.”
“We need your voices,” she said. “We need your child care providers to speak to the legislators that represent them. Clearly, no senators are up here, so make sure you meet with the senator to say, ‘This is what’s happening.’ I think that would make a tremendous impact next legislative session.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/State-officials-10-9-2025-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-10-09 20:57:05.459016

(Photo courtesy of the Auditor of State's Office)Three Republican Iowa state senators called on state Auditor Rob Sand, a Democratic candidate for governor, to perform an audit of Des Moines Public Schools in the wake of the arrest of former Superintendent Ian Roberts. Sand replied Thursday that he does not have the authority to perform an audit without the district’s request.
Sens. Jesse Green, R-Boone, Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott and Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, sent a letter to Sand Wednesday calling for the state auditor to investigate the spending and practices of DMPS following the Sept. 26 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest of Roberts.
Since the arrest, multiple reports have found that Roberts, a citizen of Guyana according to court documents, had falsified parts of his credentials and resume in addition to not disclosing his immigration status or previous criminal charges. Roberts had been given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024.

The letter from the three GOP senators said they were “becoming more and more alarmed” by reports of false information disseminated by Roberts about his background, and called for Sand to “take the time to do the job and help both lawmakers and Iowans as we continue to deal with the consequences of Roberts’ deceptions.”
“As senators with duties to pass budgets, implement policy, and hold government accountable, our job includes evaluating the process of retaining individuals to lead public schools and the accountability required to ensure the almost $4 billion of taxpayer funds are managed by people Iowans can trust,” the letter stated.
In a statement responding to the letter, Sand said he agrees with the “descriptions of Ian Roberts’ deceptions and agree that DMPS needs to be more transparent around what happened here.” But he said lawmakers should know the auditor’s office does not have the authority to conduct an audit of DMPS outside of a request for reaudit from a DMPS employee or school board official.
The GOP senators also brought up Sand’s efforts to audit the state’s Education Savings Account program providing public funds for private school tuition and associated costs in the letter. While the ESA program is expected to cost the state roughly $314 million, DMPS, which employed Roberts, received $460 million in fiscal year 2025, according to the release.
“You, as the state’s auditor, who claims to be the taxpayer watchdog while politicizing your office and spending more time campaigning for governor than actually focusing on your job, have a duty to that office and to Iowans to focus more of your time on your current job than trying to get the next one,” the senators wrote in the letter. “Iowa needs the state auditor to take the time to do the job and help both lawmakers and Iowans as we continue to deal with the consequences of Roberts’ deceptions.”
Sand responded that the senators “supported the vouchers law they chose to bring into this, which provides for no audits whatsoever of private schools spending public money, despite the fact that every public school district, including DMPS, is audited every year.”
The auditor’s office released an independent report in February about the ESA program and Odyssey, the company the state contracts with to administer the program, which stated the Iowa departments of Education and Revenue did not provide their office requested documents about whether students receiving ESA funds met the income eligibility requirements. Gov. Kim Reynolds and state department leaders responded by saying the office had not followed the correct procedures for obtaining this information, and that Sand was launching a political attack against the ESA program.
Sand also criticized Republicans, who hold a trifecta of control at the Iowa Statehouse, for passing legislation he said could allow officials to legally hide documents during an audit.
“They all have my number,” Sand said in a statement. “Had they just called me, I could have saved them the embarrassment of the public learning these lawmakers don’t know, or don’t care about, the law. I will still take their calls to save them further embarrassment.”
On Wednesday, Reynolds signed an executive order requiring state government departments use the federal E-Verify and SAVE systems to confirm immigration and citizenship status when granting occupational and professional licenses and confirming state employees’ work eligibility. The Des Moines School Board is also pursuing a lawsuit against JG Consulting, the firm contracted during the search to hire Roberts, for not disclosing information on his immigration, criminal and educational background that should have been flagged during the background check process.

(Courtesy of Offutt Air Force Base)LINCOLN — A federal judge sentenced a former civilian employee of the U.S. Air Force on Wednesday to nearly six years in federal prison on one felony count of conspiring to transmit classified national defense information via a foreign online dating platform in 2022 regarding the Russia-Ukraine war.
U.S. District Judge Brian Buescher sentenced David Franklin Slater of Auburn to 70 months in prison and a year of supervised release. Slater pleaded guilty in July; he was 64 at that time. As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors dismissed two other charges against Slater of willful transmission of national defense information. Buescher also assessed a $25,000 fine, with interest, against Slater. Slater faced up to 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine on the top charge.
According to court records, Slater worked at U.S. Strategic Command in Sarpy County between August 2021 and April 2022. StratCom is essentially the nation’s command and control center for nuclear and conventional strategic deterrence against attacks on the nation and its allies. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Prosecutors said Slater, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, attended classified StratCom briefings on the Russia-led war between February and April 2022. Slater had “top secret” security clearance. Prosecutors accused him of sharing information up to “secret,” a level below top secret.
Slater shared some of the information with an alleged co-conspirator who told Slater she was a woman living in Ukraine. Court documents indicate the woman sought info about NATO plans to help Ukraine, and Slater shared info about military targets and Russian military capabilities.
“You were the first to tell me that NATO members are traveling by train and only now (already evening) this was announced on our news,” the co-conspirator wrote in one March 2022 message, according to Slater’s indictment. “You are my secret informant love!”
In another March 2022 message, she called Slater “my secret agent.” Around April 14, 2022, she thanked Slater for telling her “valuable information” about two U.S. officials going to Ukraine — the same time that then-U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, and U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Indiana, became the first known U.S. officials to visit the country since Russia’s invasion.
The co-conspirator later asked Slater that month whether NATO would have an “unpleasant ‘surprise’” for Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In his July plea agreement, Slater wrote: “I conspired to willfully communicate national defense information to an unauthorized person.”
Prosecutors could not comment due to the ongoing federal shutdown. Slater’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Nebraska U.S. Attorney Lesley A. Woods in July said that access to classified material “comes with great responsibility.”
Said Woods: “David Slater failed in his duty to protect this information by willingly sharing national defense information with an unknown online personality despite having years of military experience that should have caused him to be suspicious of that person’s motives.”

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)The doctor charged with overseeing public health in West Virginia testified Thursday he has no input on religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccination requirements and does not have a personal or professional opinion on whether the state should offer them. 
Dr. Mark McDaniel appeared before Raleigh County Circuit Court at the order of Judge Michael Froble. Froble is overseeing two consolidated lawsuits over the state’s school vaccine law and religious freedom.
McDaniel told the judge he has final review authority for medical exemptions to the school vaccine law. 
“What about religious exemptions?” Froble asked.
“No, I don’t have a purview of that,” McDaniel answered.
McDaniel was appointed West Virginia state health officer in August, filling a position that had been vacant since December, when Dr. Matthew Christiansen left the role. McDaniel told the judge his job is “overseeing public health in West Virginia.”
He further testified that as state health officer, he has not been asked his opinion about whether the presence of children who have been granted religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccine requirements pose a danger to vaccinated children in the state’s schools.
“At this point, I’m just new to the job. I’m really kind of working over the data myself,” he replied to an attorney’s question about his view of religious exemptions. 
The state Department of Health denied an earlier request from West Virginia Watch to interview McDaniel directly. Instead, a spokeswoman for the department provided answers to questions the publication submitted by email, attributing the answers to McDaniel. 
When asked if he agreed with Gov. Morrisey’s statement that there wouldn’t be “any negative public health effect” because of religious exemptions, he didn’t answer the question. McDaniel said: “I agree with Gov. Morrisey’s position that no West Virginian should ever be forced to choose between their religious convictions and access to education.
A spokesman for the health department on Thursday said that McDaniel’s previous statements don’t contradict his testimony and that his testimony aligns with the department’s position.
“Dr. McDaniel’s testimony reflects that, because he was recently appointed, he has not been involved in processing these exemptions, which began with the Governor’s executive order at the beginning of this year,” Gailyn Markham, director of communications for the state Office of Shared Administration wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch Thursday evening. 
In addition to being the state’s acting health officer, McDaniel is the medical director in 10 states for LabCorp, and medical director for the substance abuse recovery facilities Pathways in Kentucky, Clean and Clear Advantage in Parkersburg and New Beginnings in Preston County. He is also medical director for AFC Urgent Care locations in North Carolina and Virginia, he said. 
McDaniel’s testimony was the last in a permanent injunction hearing for the cases. The hearing was held over four days in September and October. 
All states require students to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases, like measles, chickenpox and polio. West Virginia has been one of only five states in the country that have not allowed nonmedical exemptions to the requirements. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey seeks to change that. In January, he issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. His order is based on a 2023 religious freedom law. Morrisey has not rescinded the order, even though state lawmakers earlier this year voted down a bill that would have inscribed the exemptions in law. 
The state board of education earlier this year directed county boards not to accept nonmedical exemptions. The lawsuits before the court have been filed by plaintiffs on both sides of the issue. In the case of Miranda Guzman vs. the state and Raleigh County boards of education, parents are seeking to make the school boards accept religious exemptions. In the other case, parents of children who are at risk of complications if they get vaccine preventable illness are asking a judge to stop the state Department of Health from issuing the religious exemptions.
During a September hearing in the same case, Dr. Cathy Slemp, a former West Virginia state health officer, testified that the state’s compulsory vaccination law, as it’s written without religious or philosophical exemptions, is the best way to protect the state’s public health goals. 
In July, Froble issued a preliminary injunction in the case that allows students who are parties in the case to attend school with a religious exemption.
On Wednesday, Froble granted a motion certifying class action in the case. He said anyone asking the state health department for a religious, philosophical or conscientious objection exemption to the state’s vaccination requirements should be considered parties to the case. There should be no difference between religious and philosophical exemptions, he said. 
During closing arguments in the case Thursday, Chris Wiest, an attorney for Guzman and the other families who want religious exemptions, reiterated their argument that the Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023 applies to the state’s school vaccination law. 
“It does say ‘notwithstanding, any other provision of law,’ which would — any means any” Wiest said. “And it means the [compulsory vaccination law]. And I know the court’s already made preliminary determinations on that. I am unaware of any exception in the [Equal Protection for Religion Act]’s text or its title that would suggest an exception for the CVL.
“So I do think there is a finding that needs to be made that the CVL is subject to EPRA, just like every other West Virginia law,” he said. 
He also argued that the state should not include a mechanism to ensure that people seeking exemptions have sincerely held religious beliefs. Some states and military branches have requirements that people meet with chaplains, for instance. 
The health department’s current policy is to allow families to submit a written statement saying they object to the vaccine along with some demographic information. The state has granted all of the nearly 575 requests for religious exemptions it’s gotten for school year 2025-26, state epidemiologist Shannon McBee testified Wednesday. 
“I think it bears noting that the process of the [Department of Health] is sufficient to establish both sincerity and burden,” he said. “They require a written statement. It’s got to be signed in writing. It’s submitted to the government, potentially going to trigger penalties requiring that person to say that they’ve got a religious belief. And the reality is, if you think about it, no one’s going to request an exemption if it didn’t burden their beliefs, they’d simply go and comply.”
Chris Smith, an attorney representing the state school board, argued that the school’s vaccination law has been on the books for more than 80 years. When it was passed in the 1930s, it was meant to combat diphtheria, which had killed students in nearby states, he said. 
“As you heard from Dr. Slemp, the law works,” Smith said. “West Virginia has the highest level of vaccination rate for students entering the public school system. And one of the reasons that it is so effective at doing its job is that it does not have religious exemptions.”
He noted that lawmakers have pushed unsuccessfully for four or five years to get religious exemptions added to the law. 
“The governor asked them to do it this year; they didn’t do it,” Smith said. “So here we are today. The plaintiffs are using the Equal Protection for Religion Act, which is silent on the vaccination law, to attempt to legislate through litigation. This court should not certify the class.”
He further argued that the EPRA doesn’t amend the vaccine law. Even if it did, he argued, the vaccine law passes strict scrutiny, the legal standard that the government must meet when determining if its action is constitutional. To pass strict scrutiny, an action must be narrowly tailored to achieving a compelling government interest and be the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.
“The state’s paramount interest is protecting its citizens, and that’s doubly true whenever it’s children in the public school system,” Smith said. 
Froble said Thursday he expects to issue a final ruling in the case by the end of November. 
Regardless, the matter is likely to end up before the state Supreme Court. Attorneys for the state board of education have already filed notice it will appeal the preliminary injunction the court granted in July. 
Lawsuits concerning religious exemptions are pending in a handful of counties, including Kanawha, Jefferson and Berkeley, Smith told the judge.

Celsi, who represented Iowa Senate District 16, died Oct. 6 after a months-long battle with an undisclosed illness, according to a social media post from her daughter and statements from state leaders. The 59-year-old West Des Moines resident had entered hospice care Sept. 18. Earlier in the year during the 2025 legislative session, she had missed more than a month of votes before returning after she had a surgery in April.
Iowa Senate District 16 is composed of portions of Polk and Dallas counties, including parts of West Des Moines, Clive and Windsor Heights. Before redistricting, Celsi had first won election to represent Senate District 21 in 2018 to defeat Republican Brian Bales, and won reelection to the seat in 2022. After redistricting, she won in 2024 with 70% of the vote against Libertarian challenger Joshua Smith.
The Senate special election will be the sixth special election in Iowa in 2025.  There have been two other special elections in the Iowa Senate, called after Sen. Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton, passed away in August, and one in January after Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer joined Gov. Kim Reynolds’ administration. Democrats won both elections:  Sen. Mike Zimmer of DeWitt and Sen. Catelin Drey of Sioux City.

(Photo by Jason Cameron/Getty Images)After hitting a roadblock last year, a planned highway crossing through conservation land near St. George has made its way back to the desks of federal land managers. 
The Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, is reconsidering Utah’s application to build a four-lane highway stretching four miles through part of the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area.
Washington County and the state contend the proposed Northern Corridor highway is needed to clear up traffic congestion in fast-growing St. George. Conservation and environmental groups say the route would cut into core wildlife habitat for the endangered Mohave desert tortoise and disrupt scenic views.

They also worry it could set a precedent opening up other public lands to road construction, said Todd Tucci with Advocates for the West, a Boise-based environmental law firm.
“Right now is a time for all people that have dirt under their fingernails and dirt in their boots to stand up for the landscapes that they love,” Tucci said.
To date, no conservation area in the country has been carved up and paved for a highway, Tucci said, but President Donald Trump this week approved a planned mining road in Alaska that would cut partly through the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve.
Utah’s plan dates back more than two decades. It has stalled and started repeatedly since then, with environmental groups suing in 2021 and the Biden administration taking a new look at possible environmental impacts and other potential routes. 
Feds recommend alternative to long-proposed southern Utah highway, angering state leaders

In November 2024, the BLM and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommended a different option – expanding the existing Red Hills Parkway Expressway – which they said would limit the impact on wildlife habitat. The move was cheered by conservation groups and criticized by Utah’s governor and members of the state’s congressional delegation. 
Utah Rep. Celeste Maloy, a former deputy Washington County attorney, said the BLM disregarded local voices in its decision last year.
“Unelected bureaucrats have repeatedly undermined longstanding efforts from state and local leaders and demonstrated an unwillingness to partner with local governments,” Maloy said in a statement last December. “We look forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to review this decision and its compliance with federal law.”
Now the BLM says Utah’s Department of Transportation has reviewed that alternate recommendation and “identified substantial technical and economic challenges.” 
In response, the agency said it’s seeking to find another option and soliciting public feedback. The BLM is taking comments on its website through Nov. 3.

Food banks in the state are preparing for possible interruptions to SNAP and increased demand at their pantries if the ongoing government shutdown is not resolved. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)November is the busiest time of year at Arkansas Foodbank, and the federal government shutdown threatens to create additional need for the nonprofit’s services from the state’s SNAP recipients and federal employees.
The shutdown brings uncertainty about how long food safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can continue paying out benefits to those enrolled across the U.S. In Arkansas, which has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the country, food banks like Northwest Arkansas Food Bank are preparing for an expected surge in demand if the shutdown isn’t resolved in short order.
“If they don’t come to an agreement to where SNAP continues to get funded, then those people who are on SNAP are going to have to go someplace else to find food,” CEO Kent Eikenberry said. “And that’s going to be us.”
“The entire food ecosystem, in terms of hunger relief, is impacted by a government shutdown,” said Claire Tiffin, the director of community engagement for Arkansas Foodbank.
‘This shutdown feels different.’ States might not get repaid when government reopens.

SNAP is funded through October, according to Arkansas Department of Human Services spokesperson Gavin Lesnick, but he said the department is awaiting guidance on November benefits.
Tiffin said Arkansas Foodbank expects there will be interruptions to SNAP payments if the shutdown continues into next month. Any disruptions would come at “just a horrible time of year” when food banks are typically “maxed out” due to Thanksgiving, she said.
Along with the possibility of more demand because of lost SNAP benefits, the state’s food banks are also bracing for thousands of federal employees who will start missing paychecks this month.
If the funding impasse isn’t resolved by those first missed paychecks, Tiffin said, “we are going to be seeing an immediate impact at pantries.”
“So we’re gearing up for it — hoping that it’s a short shutdown, fearing that it’s not going to be — and preparing accordingly,” she said.
Regional population differences
Central Arkansas, where Arkansas Foodbank operates, has more than double the number of federal employees than the Northwest region, according to Census data of federal employees by Congressional district. That doesn’t include federal contractors or military personnel.
That blunts the shutdown’s impacts for Northwest Arkansas Food Bank, Eikenberry said, but it doesn’t mean there won’t be any effects if the government doesn’t reopen in the coming weeks.
Eikenberry said those in need have his organization in their corner.
“The message in Northwest Arkansas is, we’ve been here since 1988. … We’ll figure out a way to get through it,” he said, adding that the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank doesn’t use federal money. “We’re, for all intents and purposes, privately funded.”
Arkansas Foodbank does take advantage of federal food insecurity programs, Tiffin said — 15% of its food comes from U.S. Department of Agriculture programs. But she said the food bank has been working to offset the loss of those resources during the shutdown via emergency fundraisers. This isn’t their first government shutdown, she said, and they’ve used that experience to prepare and explore their options.
But SNAP is crucial, Tiffin said, because for every meal Arkansas Foodbank provides, the federal food programs provides nine.
“We are only a piece of the solution” for food insecurity, she said. “SNAP is the biggest solution and so when we lose that, we lose a lot of coverage for our families.”
 Farmers 
The organizations providing food for those in need aren’t the only ones in the food ecosystem that stand to be affected by the shutdown.
Arkansas’ farmers, already hurting from low commodity prices compounded by rising production costs, have lost access to the expertise they rely on from local USDA offices, said Brandy Carroll, director of commodity activities and market information for Arkansas Farm Bureau. Similarly, Carroll said accessing crop report data, another source of important information for farmers, has posed a problem since funding expired.
‘A dire strait’: 1 in 3 farms could close without aid, Arkansas agriculture leaders tell lawmakers

According to Hunter Biram, an agricultural extension economist with the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture, roughly a third of the aid Arkansas farmers were expecting is on hold due to the funding lapse, and enrollment is paused for some programs such as disaster relief for farms. The Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which provides farmers money for crop losses when prices are low and costs are high, has also run out of money, and farmers can’t get marketing assistance loans.
Biram said it’s “really important” for the government to reopen in order for farmers to get those loans, as well as the economic and disaster assistance they were already expecting.
“Overall, we’re looking at probably about $180 million worth of government assistance for Arkansas crop farms that’s being held up right now,” Biram said. “About a third of what we normally would get is hanging out there.”

“We look forward to electing a strong Republican who will continue fighting for Arkansas families and our shared conservative values,” Chairman Joseph Wood said in the party’s Thursday news release.
The Democratic Party of Arkansas announced Tuesday that it will hold its own primary for the special election.
Rep. Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock, resigned his seat last week to become Arkansas PBS’ new CEO and executive director. The network’s governing board recommended Wing in September to succeed former CEO Courtney Pledger.
Wing is a former broadcaster and owns a production company with his wife. Before his appointment as Arkansas PBS CEO, he had already announced he would not run for a sixth House term in 2026.
Pulaski County’s House District 70 includes portions of North Little Rock and Sherwood, as well as the Camp Joseph T. Robinson military base.
Democrat Alex Holladay of North Little Rock, who lost to Wing by 286 votes in the 2024 election, announced he will run for the seat in the special election. He will face Democrat Cordelia Smith-Johnson of Sherwood, who had already announced her candidacy for Wing’s seat in next year’s general election.
“Given that Democrats have overperformed by 18% in special elections since Trump took office, we feel confident that we can deliver another seat for Democrats in our State House,” Democratic Party of Arkansas Chairman retired Col. Marcus Jones said in a statement Tuesday.
Bo Renshaw of North Little Rock is so far the only Republican to announce candidacy for the District 70 seat.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has yet to announce the dates of the special primary and general election for District 70. State law requires a governor to call a special election to fill a vacant legislative seat within 150 days, unless it’s impractical or too burdensome to do so.
Franklin County resident sues to move up election to fill Arkansas senator’s seat

Sanders received bipartisan pushback in September for scheduling a special election in November 2026 to fill the Senate District 26 seat vacated by the death of Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch.
Sanders responded by moving the special Senate election up to June 2026. The special primary election currently coincides with the midterm primaries on March 31, 2026.
A resident of the Franklin County portion of Senate District 26 asked a Pulaski County judge Monday to move up the special election to December so the district’s voters can be represented in the 2026 fiscal session. Lawmakers are expected to consider funding for construction of a controversial state prison in Franklin County during the session.

Applications will be available at the sessions for those who have asked for one but have not yet received it.
In the updated RECA reauthorization, lawmakers increased the compensation amount from $50,000 to $100,000 for those who developed serious illnesses from nuclear weapons testing in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho and New Mexico. However, those who have already received RECA payments can’t reapply for additional compensation.
The program was also expanded, going from covering only 10 counties in the state to include all of Utah for eligibility. 
People who lived in the state for at least 12 months between 1951 and 1962 and contracted certain types of cancer may be entitled for compensation. Eligible cancers include leukemia — but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia — multiple myeloma, lymphomas (other than Hodgkin’s), and primary cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, salivary gland, brain, stomach, urinary bladder, colon, thyroid, pancreas, breast, esophagus, bile ducts, liver, gall bladder, lung, and ovarian.

Santiago/Getty Images)Firearm-related deaths are up dramatically among middle- and high school-aged youth, according to a new study led by Washington State University researchers.  
The researchers found that, nationwide, high schoolers ages 14 to 18 are at an exceptionally elevated risk for gun-inflicted injury and death compared to children in other age groups in both rural and urban settings. 
They discovered that since 2017, firearms have surpassed motor vehicle collisions as the leading cause of mortality for youth ages 11 to 18, spiking from 1,945 deaths in 2001 to 3,224 in 2022. 
The paper, published in the journal Injury Epidemiology last month, helps fill a key gap in the previous research, study authors said. 
“These findings contribute significantly to our knowledge of what’s actually happening,” said Elizabeth Weybright, associate professor and adolescent extension specialist in Washington State University’s department of human development and the paper’s co-author.
The study is among the first to separate younger children and adolescents into different data sets, focusing on middle schoolers ages 11 to 13 and high schoolers ages 14 to 18. 
While previous research looking at both children and adolescents  is “interesting and informative,” Weybright said, “high schoolers are very different from toddlers.” 
Research on shooting fatalities that combines children and adolescents into one group ignores distinct developmental stages and associated risks, according to Weybright and her fellow researchers. 
“Addressing firearm mortality as a public health crisis requires strategies tailored to developmental stage, injury intent, setting, and cultural context,” they state in the study’s abstract. 
Using federal data spanning 2001 to 2022, the researchers uncovered trends in firearm deaths for 11- to 18-year-olds in rural and urban settings. 
The data showed that firearms are the leading cause of death for urban high schoolers, surpassing motor vehicle collisions. 
Though motor vehicle collisions are still the leading cause of death for rural high schoolers, they are decreasing, while firearm deaths are becoming more common.
Firearm deaths due to homicide have increased by more than 362% among rural high schoolers since 2001, though suicide is still the primary cause of firearm death for both high schoolers and middle schoolers in rural locations. 
Meanwhile, homicides are the leading cause of firearm deaths for urban high schoolers, surging more than 127% from a 2013 low.
The study suggests that adapting firearm safety guidance to different childhood developmental stages could be crucial to saving lives.
“Often, the support and guidance we give parents about safe firearm storage isn’t tailored by youth developmental stage,” Weybright said. “As a child starts to age and have more autonomy, that could be a time to revisit firearm safety practices and provide different types of messaging.”
She envisions a revised, more comprehensive approach when it comes to rural communities, which have seen a significant uptick in firearm-related homicides among youth.
“We talk a lot about youth suicide risk in rural areas and less about the risk for homicide,” Weybright said. “This study highlights that we need interventions for both.”
Washington state lawmakers passed a controversial bill this year that, starting in 2027, will require those interested in purchasing guns to apply for a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol. 
The permit system goes beyond the state’s existing background checks, which also require proof of completion of a firearm safety course.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Wintrow, D-Boise, participated in an online press conference Thursday with U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, as the partial shutdown of the federal government was in its ninth day. 
“I am overwhelmed with calls from people all over the state who are frustrated and afraid about the things that are happening in their health care,” Wintrow said. 
Open enrollment on the Your Health Idaho health insurance exchange, where Idahoans can apply for a tax credit and enroll in a health insurance plan for next year, opens Oct. 15 and runs through Dec. 15. 
Murray warned that unless Congress extends the tax credits originally passed in 2021, thousands of Idahoans on the state’s health exchange will see “a huge spike in their health care costs.” Without those credits, 25,000 Idahoans are likely to cancel their insurance policies — as average premiums are expected to double, Pat Kelly, executive director of Your Health Idaho, previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“But Republicans don’t want to talk about it. And they have refused to do anything about it. In fact, Republicans have chosen to shut down the government rather than work with Democrats on a solution to stop this from happening. So here’s my feeling on this: if Republicans don’t want to level with their own constituents about what is at stake, I am happy to do it,” Murray said.
Wintrow said unless Congress extends enhanced premium tax credits, those credits will expire at the end of the year and thousands of Idahoans would see their health insurance premiums increase or be unable to afford health insurance all together.
“In less than a week … we’ll have open enrollment, and the threats of these increases are serious and skyrocketing,” Wintrow said. 
The federal government began shutting down Oct. 1 after Congress was unable to pass a budget or continuing funding resolution before the new fiscal year began.
“We are talking about families with kids,” Murray said. “We are talking about seniors, retirees who aren’t old enough for Medicare but desperately need health coverage. We are talking about countless farmers, small business owners, and freelancers. If Republicans continue refusing to act, then next week, families across Idaho are going to come face to face with premiums they simply cannot afford.”
 Idahoans share concerns over whether they’ll be able to afford health insurance without tax credits

During the press conference, two retired Idahoans, Bob McMichael of Council and Susan Wood of Boise, said they are worried they won’t be able to afford health insurance if the tax credits are not extended. 
Wood said she bought a health insurance plan on the exchange and received a tax credit of $580, which brought her premium down to $72 a month. But if the tax credit goes away, Wood said she would be looking at an increase of 900% if nothing else changes in her current plan. 
The federal government shut down after a health care clash. In Idaho, the stakes are high.

“This is just a crisis, and we are falling off of a cliff,” said Wood, who worked in the insurance industry before retiring. “It’s an impossible situation that needs to be fixed for the long term. But the immediate solution is for our representatives to work together (in Congress) and approve the advanced tax credit so insurance companies can file and make their new plans with certainty, U.S. citizens can retain their health coverage at a reasonable premium and we can move on with our lives.”
Meanwhile, Republicans blamed Democrats for the shutdown, saying the Democrats are refusing to budge from spending priorities and unwilling to work with Republicans. 
“Democrats, not Republicans, set the expiration date on the Biden administration’s enhanced Obamacare credits,” U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, told the Sun in a statement earlier this week. “These are temporary, COVID-era subsidies.

Seven people have contracted measles in an outbreak involving students at Fairforest Elementary School, which is part of Spartanburg School District 6, and Global Academy, a public charter school, department officials said. The two reported a combined attendance of nearly 1,400 students during the 2024-2025 school year, according to Department of Education data, meaning at least 11% of their joint student body has not received the measles vaccine.
SC health officials urge vaccination as measles spreads in Upstate

In total, the state has reported 11 cases of measles so far this year, the highest number since the disease was eradicated more than two decades ago. All 11 people were unvaccinated, and none had immunity from a previous infection, according to the department.
The department reported its latest confirmed case Thursday, in a Greenville County child. Officials are working to determine whether the child had interacted with anyone at the two schools involved in the outbreak, or if the infection came from a different source, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters.
“What this new case tells us is that there is active, unrecognized community transmission of measles occurring in the Upstate, which makes it vital to ensure that the public have received the recommended measles vaccinations,” Bell said.
Exposed students
Measles symptoms usually start with a fever, cough, red eyes and runny nose, followed by a rash that typically begins on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. The rash can last up to a week.
Severe cases of the virus can cause pneumonia or brain swelling, which can be fatal, especially in young children, according to the public health department
Anyone with symptoms should stay home from school or work and contact a doctor, according to the agency.
The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after a sick person passes through a room, making it possible to get sick without directly interacting with an infected person, Bell said. With that in mind, health officials identified 153 unvaccinated students exposed to the measles at the two schools.
Exposed students are expected to stay home for 21 days, which is how long the virus can stay in a person’s body before they realize their sick, Bell said. Although people exposed to measles are typically not infectious until they begin showing symptoms, a person also might not recognize it’s measles causing their cough, runny nose or red eyes, giving the disease time to spread undetected, she said.
Because the quarantined students received different levels of exposure, it’s difficult to project how many of those might actually get sick, Bell said.
“In a school population, you can imagine, with the moving from room to room, moving through hallways, it’s not easy to identify the specific degree and duration of direct contact that could lead to someone being at higher risk of developing disease than others who still fit the definition of exposure,” she said.
Up to 90% of unvaccinated people exposed to the measles will get the virus, Bell said.



How to get vaccinated
Amid the outbreak, the state Department of Public Health is working to increase access to the measles vaccine using its mobile health clinics, especially in areas with fewer pharmacies and clinics, state epidemiologist Linda Bell said.
In the meantime, vaccines are usually available in doctors’ offices, health departments and pharmacies. Most health insurance plans cover measles vaccines, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
An unvaccinated person exposed to the disease can potentially avoid getting sick or have a more mild reaction to the virus if they receive a dose of the vaccine within 72 hours of exposure, Bell said. The department did not have any information about whether any of the public school students exposed to the virus in the Upstate have taken advantage of that window to receive a vaccine.
The measles, mumps and rubella shot is typically administered during childhood — a first dose at one year to 15 months of age and a second dose between 4 and 6 years old. But unvaccinated adults can receive it as well. The only exceptions are pregnant women and people with certain autoimmune diseases, according to the CDC.
Those who received two doses during childhood do not need any additional boosters, since the vaccine is 97% effective at protecting against the disease, Bell said.
Anyone unsure of whether they’ve received the vaccine should check with their doctor. If vaccine records are unavailable, “there’s no harm in getting another dose,” according to the CDC.



Low rates of immunity
South Carolina requires all children enrolled in school, both public and private, to be up to date on vaccinations, though there are exemptions granted for religious or medical reasons.
Spartanburg County, the center of the outbreak, has one of the lowest vaccination rates among school children in the state, according to health department data provided to the SC Daily Gazette.
A little less than 90% of K-12 students at the county’s 94 public schools submitted completed vaccination forms this year.
That’s the third lowest rate of any county in the state, DPH data show. Only Jasper County, at 82%, and Fairfield County, at 89.4%, have a lower rate of valid immunization certificates, according to the data.
The department does not break down data by school district or type of vaccine.
The overall rate of students coming into school with all their immunizations has dropped in recent years, from more than 98% statewide a decade ago to 94% during the most recent school year, according to agency data.
Health officials strive for a vaccination rate of about 95%, which is high enough to keep the virus from spreading, Bell said.


At the same time, the rate of students receiving religious exemptions has risen, from less than 1% in 2014-2015 to more than 3.3% during the last school year — or about 22,000 more unvaccinated students statewide. These exemptions have been steadily climbing for years, but they increased significantly when students returned to school following the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the data.
The qualifications for these exemptions have not changed, but for the first time this year, parents could access the forms for religious exemptions online instead of needing to visit their local health department to get a copy.
The one-page form requires parents to certify they have read all information, provided by the department, on the health risks associated with not vaccinating their child. The form also tells parents that their child can be sent home from school if there is an outbreak. A parent or guardian must then get the form notarized before submitting it to the school nurse.
More than 8% of Spartanburg County’s 58,000 students received a religious exemption during the 2024-2025 school year, by far the most of any county in the state, according to DPH data.
Schools respond
Three of the confirmed cases involved students at Fairforest Elementary, which had about 830 students last year — the most recent data available. All students in the district who have not received the vaccine are expected to attend class virtually and complete assignments at home, district spokeswoman Cynthia Robinson said in an email.
“We want to reassure our families that no additional measles cases have been reported at any other schools within Spartanburg County School District Six,” Robinson said in a statement. “Our top priority remains the health, safety and education of our students and staff.”
Global Academy, which had 565 students in kindergarten through eighth grade last school year, declined to comment.
The Department of Public Health does not release the age, sex, identity or specific location of people who contracted the virus out of privacy concerns, Bell said.
Parents with children at the schools did receive emails informing them there was an outbreak and telling families what they should do to prevent further spread of the disease, Bell said.
“We really rely on these families to comply with our guidance, to make sure that even if they’re excluded from school, they’re not out and about in the community,” she said. “Compliance is very important with supporting our prevention of ongoing spread in the community.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/measles-vaccine-1024x719.jpg,,,2025-10-09 18:58:42.832697

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) accused the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of predatory marketing tactics for cannabis in a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025. (Screenshot from senate.gov) Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) urged United States Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) over cannabis sales that he alleged target young people and involve illegal transportation of a controlled substance.
During a recent Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing  Tillis told Bondi  that the tribe’s marketing of recreational marijuana grown and sold on its land reminds him of the tobacco industry’s marketing tactics. He presented posters with advertisements from the Great Smoky Cannabis Company, operated by Qualla Enterprises, LLC, which is owned by the EBCI.
Tillis singled out a promotion for pumpkin spice-flavored cannabis products among other Halloween offerings. “This worries me because this is a money-making enterprise. It kind of seems like it’s preying on younger people.”
Because of the principle of tribal sovereignty, federally recognized tribes like the EBCI are able to exercise their own authority over regulation of the cannabis industry. In 2024, the tribe opened its first cannabis dispensary, allowing North Carolinians to legally purchase recreational marijuana on its lands — which becomes an illegal substance should they take it off EBCI land.
“Now, it’s illegal in North Carolina and Tennessee and Georgia and South Carolina to buy pot, but apparently, you can go order it on an app and ride over there to the boundary and get it,” Tillis said Tuesday. “I assume they’re not delivering it outside of the boundary, because I think that would be illegal.”

Bondi said she is “not familiar with that establishment” but promised to have her team look into the app and the cannabis company’s commercial activities. She said “based on federal law,” transporting marijuana  through a jurisdiction where it’s banned would be illegal.
In a statement Thursday, EBCI Principal Chief Michell Hicks criticized Tillis for misrepresenting the tribe’s cannabis industry, asserting that its operations are “fully compliant with federal and tribal law.”
“Senator Thom Tillis knows full well that the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians operates squarely within the law. Yet once again, he has chosen to ignore that truth to advance his own political agenda,” Hicks said. “To suggest the EBCI would endanger children through marketing or sales practices is inaccurate and it is offensive to the values that guide our tribe.”
Tillis’s remarks follow a March joint letter from his office and Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) demanding law enforcement agencies “uphold current federal and state laws” around marijuana. That letter was not addressed to the EBCI itself, Hicks said, because “his accusations cannot withstand scrutiny.”

Hicks said Tillis’s claims are motivated by frustration over the EBCI’s opposition to recognition for the Lumbee Tribe, which has sought federal status promised by President Donald Trump during the 2024 campaign through a bill sponsored by Tillis.
Speaking to Bondi, Tillis said he has “no problem” with marijuana sales, but stressed that “we’ve got to get it solved at the federal level,” observing that even Republican-majority states like North Carolina and Bondi’s home state of Florida are trending toward legalization. His issue, he said, is with “unsafe and inconsistent practices” like those he charges the EBCI with.
He noted that billboards in Charlotte advertise one of the largest dispensaries in the United States and asked Bondi about the legality of them shipping cannabis grown on their farm to the dispensary through non-tribal land.
“I can’t find any legal way to get this pot that is grown here to the dispensary that’s in another non-contiguous area of the boundaries,” he said. “I’m just trying to figure out how the Eastern Band of the Cherokee are legally transporting what they’re growing at scale here.”
Tillis focused the rest of his questions for Bondi on the deployment of the National Guard in major American cities, which he said he is having a “real struggle” with. He said law enforcement failures should be addressed through state and local elections, not federal intervention.
“I reject any notion that Charlotte’s on that list, by the way, so whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican, bring it on,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tillis-Oversight-Hearing-1024x768.png,,,2025-10-09 18:58:42.832697

Game and Fish officials say they would have been out of bounds pursuing rigid safeguards for mule deer, or other big game species, at a 3-square-mile state-owned site south of Cody. 
The post Wyoming finalizes State Shooting Complex lease without formal environmental review or wildlife stipulations appeared first on WyoFile .","A lease to develop a 3-square-mile state-owned tract in the Absaroka Range foothills has been finalized without any mandatory measures to mitigate impacts on mule deer, which use “crucial” habitat that overlaps the site throughout the year. 
The incursion into deer range and other designated wildlife habitat comes from the Wyoming State Shooting Complex, a subsidized public-private venture set in motion by successful 2023 legislation. Before a 12-member legislative task force voted in July 2024 to locate an event center, long-range targets and other infrastructure on the 1,956-acre property in Park County, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department issued a memo that effectively recommended the complex go elsewhere because of wildlife conflicts. 
State wildlife officials, however, called the review “internal department correspondence” and not an “official project letter,” even though it was printed and signed on Game and Fish letterhead and addressed to an outside legislative task force. 
Fifteen months later, the 75-year lease for the Wyoming State Shooting Complex was finalized by the State Board of Land Commissioners, which met last week in Cheyenne. In the intervening months, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department was never asked to complete a formal review of the project’s wildlife impacts, and so that assessment does not exist. 
“We do rely on the permitting agency to request a formal environmental review,” Game and Fish Director Angi Bruce told WyoFile.

Alternatively, developers will often seek an environmental review, Bruce said. In the case of the Wyoming State Shooting Complex, the request came from neither party. In the Game and Fish director’s view, it’s not the state agency’s role to step in and formally vet a project’s wildlife impacts without a review being requested. 
“We have not done that before,” Bruce said. “At the end of the day, this is a legislative action that passed and is now in state law. We’re going to respect that.”
The permitting agency for the Wyoming State Shooting Complex is the Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments. 
State land leases for extractive activities, like oil and gas drilling, typically trigger project reviews and standard wildlife-friendly stipulations, according to Cody Booth, the office’s lands management program supervisor. 
On state lands administered by his office, there is a standard oil and gas stipulation for crucial big game winter range — like the Wyoming State Shooting Complex site, where it’s designated for mule deer. The stipulation states that developers “shall” avoid human activity in crucial range for big game species from Nov. 15 to April 30. Variances require the director’s approval, consultation with Game and Fish and plans that “provide similar resource protection and mitigation.”

But surface-disturbing activities on state lands permitted via a “special-use lease” are regulated more loosely, Booth said. That’s due to the wide variety of projects that require a special-use lease, which is a “catch-all bucket” for permanent changes to the land ranging from a commercial shooting complex to a trail network, he said.
“We have to take these [leases] on a case-by-case scenario, and we’re not able to develop those same standard stipulations,” Booth said. “There’s not stipulations in the same sense as an oil and gas lease, but there could be comments or recommendations from Game and Fish.” 
Because the Office of State Lands and Investments didn’t ask for a project review from its sister agency, Game and Fish’s formal recommendations don’t exist in writing.  
But Booth said the State Shooting Complex’s developers have been in talks with wildlife managers.
“It’s our understanding that the lessee is working diligently with the Game and Fish,” he said, “and on a variety of wildlife matters.” 
An event center associated with the Wyoming State Shooting Complex has been tentatively slated where the yellow star is located on this map. The large facility will include an information center, retail shop, ATV and firearm rental, administrative offices, classrooms, shooting area, archery and air rifle range and more. (Park County)
Additionally, he pointed out that there’s a provision in the State Shooting Complex lease that requires developers “to observe state and federal laws and regulations for the protection of fish and wildlife.” 
The specific concessions being made to minimize harm to crucial mule deer range and core sage grouse habitat in the southern third of the site were not available before this story was published. 
Glenn Ross, who chairs the Wyoming State Shooting Complex Joint Powers Board, could not be reached for an interview Thursday. But previously, he told WyoFile that Game and Fish’s wildlife impact concerns were considered from the get-go and an earlier Park County site north of Cody was abandoned because it overlapped an elk calving area.
“Our planning with our site has been making every attempt to be wildlife friendly,” Ross told WyoFile last summer. 
There was no discussion about impacts to wildlife habitat when the State Board of Land Commissioners — comprised of Wyoming’s top five elected officials — met last week to finalize the complex’s lease. The 75-year lease went through without any major controversy, though Secretary of State Chuck Gray did oppose an amendment that closed the entire 1,956-acre state land site to the general public. 
“This is just a little too heavy handed for me, all 2,000 acres,” Gray said. “I think there is a path, maybe, to get a little more of a balance there.” 
The site design for the Wyoming State Shooting Complex is nearing completion, according to the Powell Tribune. Its joint powers board met Thursday morning to potentially approve the design, the newspaper reported, and a public meeting to show off the new design has been scheduled for 5:30-7:30 p.m. Oct. 15 at the Park County Courthouse.

For months residents of the village in Newbury have relied on trucked-in water from New Hampshire. With winter approaching, residents might soon need another option.

Residents of Wells River are still grappling with uncertainty about their water supply after the village well was shut down in July as a precautionary measure following an oil spill that contaminated the surrounding area last January. 
Since the village well was turned off, the nearly 500 residents who depended on it have been relying on water from nearby Woodsville, New Hampshire, which has been hauled across the Connecticut River by trucks carrying about 30,000 gallons of water per day, according to Erik White, one of the village’s trustees. But those trucks will no longer be able to climb the hill to deliver water to the storage tank during winter months.
The possibility of going without water has alarmed residents, but White said the trustees are doing everything they can to prevent that from happening.
“We’re working through it just as fast as we can, assuring the people of the village of Wells River: we will not run out of water,” he said, adding that it would still help if people conserve water as much as possible.
White said the village trustees will present state officials with an action plan by October 15 to determine the next steps.
The first option, according to White, would be to install a new tank at the bottom of the hill that the trucks could reach during colder weather. The new tank would then be connected to an existing transmission line to bring water to the storage tank on the hill. 
Another option would be to turn the well back on. However, White said the trustees would prefer to finish the cleanup process before using the well again. If they do need to use the well, they would like to install and employ a granular activated carbon treatment system, which would filter the water in case of possible contamination from the oil spill, he said.
Matthew Hunt, community operations supervisor with the state’s Drinking Water and Groundwater Protection Division within the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, said that the testing conducted has never shown contamination from the oil spill in the well while it was in use. The state recommended that the village turn the well off in July so that the withdrawal of water wouldn’t move the contamination toward the well while cleanup efforts continued.
“That was an excellent precautionary measure, and it has so far prevented the well from becoming contaminated,” Hunt said.
The challenge for the village now, White said, is making sure they have enough money to build the new systems needed to provide water and continue the cleanup. So far, the village has relied on money provided by Union Mutual — the insurance company that covers the property where the oil spill occurred — to pay for cleanup costs and for bringing in water from New Hampshire.
White said the insurance company can provide up to $2 million. While he thinks there should still be enough money left to install a new tank, he said the village might have to look for other funds for the granular activated carbon system, which could also take more time to implement.
Max Saylor and Matt Moran, who work with the department’s Waste Management and Prevention Division, said the state contributed to the initial cleanup efforts through the Petroleum Clean-Up Fund, which provided $50,000. The remaining costs should be covered by the responsible party, they said.
White also mentioned the village had received a federal grant before the oil spill to explore building a second water source. They have started to evaluate locations for a potential new well, but the approval and construction process could take over a year, he said.
“That’s something which is not going to happen before the winter time,” said Hunt, with the DEC’s drinking water and groundwater protection division. 
“We’re focused right now on making sure that there are measures in place such that the system can function throughout the winter, and then we’ll look at more mid-long range permanent solutions next year,” he said.

(Courtesy photo, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper and Dan Armstrong)The Environmental Protection Agency has signed off on Montana’s plan to discard numeric water quality standards and adopt a measure that was passed by the 2025 Legislature allowing state officials to revert back to an older system, which many groups criticize as being insufficient to protect the Treasure State’s already struggling waterways.
In 2014, Montana adopted numeric water quality standards, which has been hailed by scientists and conservation organizations as the scientific gold standard which is most likely to ensure clean water throughout the state. In summary, it’s a system where nutrients, pollutants and other water quality issues are measured by sampling results reflected numerically.
However, the Montana Legislature had been thwarted by federal authorities for years as it tried to overturn the numeric standards in favor of something less rigorous. But with a change in presidential administration, state officials through the Montana Department of Environmental Quality have convinced the Trump administration to revert to “narrative standards,” which doesn’t require the same standards of water testing, making it more challenging to gauge or compare the health of the waterways.
Conservation groups and scientists said this marks a step backwards for Montana’s waterways at an already critical time. This summer, rivers in the Big Hole Basin faced hot temperatures, low water flows and a critically low number of fish. Meanwhile, development in nearby Gallatin County has caused repeated algae blooms and pollution.
Groups like the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper said these new regulations will allow polluters to skirt water quality laws in the absence of clear measurable, objective scientific testing. Several different environmental groups said they’re considering the next steps in legal action, but regional EPA administrator Cyrus Western said that the EPA does not prohibit narrative standards, and that House Bill 664 satisfies federal clean water standards.
Rep. Bill Mercer, R-Billings, was the lead sponsor of the bill. The Montana House of Representatives passed the legislation, 69-to-30, with 12 Democrats joining all the Republicans in support of the bill. In the Montana Senate, only two Democrats jointed with all Republicans to support the measure, 32-18. Derek Harvey of Butte and Sara Novak of Deer Lodge were the only Democratic support in the Senate.
By most accounts, narrative standards are considered more lenient and flexible, while critics of numeric standards say that the measurements are too rigid and may not pinpoint the source of the pollution.
Upper Missouri Waterkeeper said it is reviewing the decision by the EPA and has vowed to “take necessary actions to defend Montana’s vital clean water resources against unscientific decision-making that’s both contrary to federal law and will risk the future health of our valued waterways.”
The Waterkeeper also alleges that Montana’s DEQ has ignored or stalled implementation of the Clean Water Act, a federal law governing clean water as it’s issuing discharge permits without numeric standards so that large industrial and municipal entities could discharge pollution without consequence. A cursory look of that provision in state law shows few remedies for those companies or individuals who pollute.
The Waterkeeper also said the penalty provision of the new law has never been “meaningfully implemented or enforced,” raising fears that even if pollution rises, the state will struggle to punish bad actors. The Waterkeeper also referred to a recent study which showed that the state’s fisheries, streams and rivers generate around $1.3 billion annually for Montana’s economy.
“This is another gift to polluters and developers at the public’s and environment’s expense. There is no scientific or legal basis for abandoning numeric nutrient standards that prevent nutrient pollutions in our rivers and streams. The State of Montana and Gov. Greg Gianforte are throwing away the measuring stick used to determine when water quality is being degraded,” said Guy Alsentzer, Executive Director of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dsp_25-0239-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-09 18:58:42.832697

Vermont’s Republican Gov. Phil Scott on Thursday criticized President Donald Trump’s deployment of national guard troops to Chicago, Illinois, and Portland, Oregon, against the will of officials there — and said he thinks Trump’s actions violate the U.S. Constitution.
“From what I’m seeing, I just think it’s unnecessary. It further divides and threatens people,” the governor said at a press conference in Waterbury. “We need stability right now in this country — we don’t need more unrest.”
As of that afternoon, Trump had called up 500 guard members from Illinois and Texas to the Chicago area, some of whom were seen at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility west of the city’s downtown. Trump also ordered 200 members of Oregon’s national guard to deploy into Portland, Oregon, but that plan was in a holding pattern following two rulings from federal judges. The status of the Chicago deployment was not entirely clear, either, with its own legal challenge pending in federal court.
“I don’t think our guard should be used against our own people. I don’t think the military should be used against our own people. In fact, it’s unconstitutional,” Scott said. “Unless, of course, there’s an insurrection, much like we saw Jan. 6 a few years ago,” he said, referring to the attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Trump in 2021.
Trump has said the deployments to both Democratic-led cities are necessary to crack down on crime, though data shows rates of violent crime in Chicago and Portland have not been getting worse in recent years. The president has also said the deployment is meant to protect ICE’s operations in those cities from protestors.
Scott indicated that he would reject a similar request to use Vermont’s national guard, if Trump made such an ask. The governor has declined two requests from the White House to use Vermont’s guard in recent months — one to aid immigration enforcement in Vermont, and another for Trump’s crackdown on Washington, D.C. 
On Wednesday, Trump said on social media that Chicago Mayor Brandon Jonson, and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, should be jailed “for failing to protect” ICE agents there.
Scott said Thursday of Trump’s threat to jail a sitting governor that the president “uses words in those kinds of ways all the time,” but if Trump were to make good on his threat, Scott would be “on the forefront” of pushing back against the president’s actions.
“I just think it’s wrong on many, many different levels,” he said of the jailing threat.

A ‘clean’ funding extension
The governor’s comments came several days after he faced criticism from the state’s Democratic Party leadership over a letter he sent to top U.S. senators urging them to come to a deal that would have avoided a federal government shutdown. Scott sent the letter to U.S. Senate Democratic and Republican leadership on Sept. 29, two days before Congress’ deadline to pass a funding bill.
Since then, both parties have dug in their heels. Democrats, including all three members of Vermont’s Congressional delegation, say they won’t agree on a plan to reopen the government unless Republicans agree to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire. Without the subsidies, millions are estimated to lose health coverage.
In the letter, Scott urged the Senate leaders “to pass a bipartisan, clean funding extension” that would keep the government’s lights on temporarily while lawmakers worked out a longer-term deal. A “clean” extension generally means a short-term funding agreement that keeps federal spending at or around its current levels and does have politically-motivated policy changes attached. 
In a statement Monday, May Hanlon, head of the state’s Democratic party, said Scott’s letter was advocating for a resolution to Congress’ funding stalemate that stripped away health care. State officials have estimated 45,000 people in Vermont could lose coverage from the lapse of the subsidies and recent changes to Medicaid eligibility and procedures. Both are currently written into federal law.
“The proposal he would support codifies deep health care cuts that put Vermonters’ lives at risk,” Hanlon said. “Performative neutrality in the face of clear harm is not leadership.”
But Scott pushed back on that assessment at Thursday’s press conference. 
After a reporter asked about Hanlon’s critique, Scott pulled out a paper copy of his letter to the senators and read it in its entirety, “just so you understand how we got to where we are today and how words are sometimes twisted,” he told the gathered press. 
He contended that he meant for his letter to call for a “clean” resolution that, also, included an extension of the subsidies. That’s because he used the word “bipartisan,” he said, referring to how the subsidies are a Democratic demand. 
“My intent was, continue to do what we’re doing today, and work on the budget that needs to be passed separately,” Scott said. “But, don’t harm people in the meantime.”

A company that has for years sought to store nuclear waste in New Mexico announced this week that it was withdrawing that plan, citing an “untenable path forward for used fuel storage in New Mexico,” according to a spokesperson.
Florida-based company Holtec, in partnership with the local Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance, has been seeking state and federal permission since at least 2018 to store spent nuclear fuel in Southeastern New Mexico. In May 2023, it received a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to “receive, possess, transfer and store 500 canisters holding approximately 8,680 metric tons of commercial spent nuclear fuel for 40 years.”
But earlier that year, the Legislature had passed Senate Bill 53 banning state agencies from granting permits, contracts or leases to build a high-level nuclear waste storage facility, including the New Mexico Department of Transportation and New Mexico Environment from issuing permits for construction and operations.
In a statement Thursday to Source New Mexico, Holtec spokesperson Patrick O’Brien suggested the statewide pushback was behind the decision to abandon its plans, known as the HI-STORE project, in the state. 
“After discussions with our longtime partner in the HI-STORE project, the Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance, and due to the untenable path forward for used fuel storage in New Mexico, we mutually agreed upon cancelling the agreement,” O’Brien said in an email. “This allows for ELEA to work to redevelop the property in a manner that fits their needs and allows Holtec to work with other states who are amenable to used fuel storage.”
Some New Mexico elected officials cheered the announcement, including Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo), who sponsored SB53. 
In a statement Thursday to Source, the governor said she is glad Holtec heard the state’s “strenuous objections,” citing the state law, and withdrew its plans. 
“We stand firm in our resolve to protect our state from becoming a nuclear dumping ground,” she said. 
State laws protect New Mexico despite SCOTUS nuclear storage ruling against Texas, experts say

In a statement on social media late Wednesday, her office noted New Mexico is already “doing its part” regarding nuclear waste storage at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. 
The announcement comes despite a June United States Supreme Court ruling favorable to companies like Holtec. The court ruled 6-3 that Texas and other parties lacked standing to challenge the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s decision to provide a permit to another company with a proposed facility about 40 miles away in Texas. 
At the time, local environmental groups, including the state’s chapter of the Sierra Club, decried the ruling because it removed their legal capacity to intervene in the NRC’s permitting process. Holtec, at the time, called the ruling “a significant win for the nuclear industry” that “reaffirms our license in NM.”
Still, longtime anti-nuclear advocate Don Hancock told Source in June that the state’s anti-waste protections, as well as what he described as bad economics for the company, made him skeptical New Mexicans would see truckloads of radioactive material anytime soon. 
“I think they know they cannot proceed with the site in New Mexico,” he said June 18.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/holtec-international-lrg-1024x577.gif,,,2025-10-09 17:59:07.582807

A Pew research survey found that 46% of Vermonters aren’t part of a religion, one of the highest rates of unaffiliated in the nation. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Fewer Vermonters report religious affiliation in nationwide survey.","Doc Bradley grew up in rural Oklahoma and finished his doctorate in Las Vegas before joining the University of Vermont as a professor of politics and religion. When he began teaching here, he was surprised to see that his students were unfamiliar with Christian concepts, like the Trinity or salvation, which seemed well-known elsewhere.
“I had to actually spend a couple of weeks explaining these and the purpose of these, because it’s just not ingrained in the culture,” he said. 
His observation was backed up by recent data from Pew Research Center. It recently published the results of its Religious Landscape Study — one of the nation’s largest surveys of religious beliefs, identities and practices — which found 46% of Vermonters have no religious affiliation, the second-highest rate in the nation.
The number of Vermonters who reported belonging to a religion also fell 9 percentage points between 2014 and the most recent 2023-24 survey. 
Almost all of that decline came from a drop in Christians, while the percent reporting they were part of another religion like Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism or Islam remained stable. 
There are some caveats to the data for Vermont. The state-level survey had an error margin of 7 percentage points, making it hard to draw conclusions about religious groups beyond Christianity. Pew surveyed more than 35,000 people nationwide, including 373 Vermonters, between July 2023 and March 2024.
The survey was also based on self-reported religious identity. Mary Jo Neitz, a sociology researcher at the University of Missouri who has studied religious life, cautioned that the way people describe themselves may have changed over time. 
Twenty years ago, someone who was “baptized Presbyterian, but they haven’t been in a Presbyterian Church for 30 years,” would have called themselves Presbyterian on a survey, she said. “But now I think those people will say, ‘I’m no religion.’” 
However, the decline in Vermont parallels a decadeslong national decline in Christianity found in Pew’s survey and other research. 
Why the shift? One factor seems to be what demographers call “cohort replacement:” More religious older people are dying off and being replaced by less religious younger people, Boston University professor emerita Nancy Ammerman said.
That’s being compounded by younger generations seeing religion more negatively because of its association with conservative politics and scandals, she said.

“Parents are not necessarily taking their kids to church or synagogue, and if you’ve grown up without a religious tradition, and all you see in the news about religion is some right-wing politician or some scandal of abuse in the church, that’s not exactly what you want to do with your Sundays,” she said. 
From very religious to nonreligious
There was a time when Vermont was one of the most religious states in the nation, Bradley said. 
New England and New York were the center of a major religious movement during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century, he said. Vermont also produced key religious leaders like Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, and William Miller, the founder of a prominent religious movement at the time known as Millerism.
In the 19th century, Protestant congregations were the focal point of New England communities.
“As Europeans came here, among the first things that happened was that they would establish a congregation … and so many New England towns have a Congregationalist church sitting right at the center of the town,” Ammerman said. 
Churches were also the center of the community in a broader sense. 
“If the community needed to gather, needed to deliberate about something, that’s where they went,” Ammerman said. 
Religion continued to play a major role in Vermonters’ lives as immigrants brought Catholicism to the state in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, she said. Catholicism remains the largest Christian domination in the state; 18% of Vermonters say they are Catholic, according to Pew data. 
But the wave of Evangelical Protestantism in the mid-20th century did not make its way to Vermont to the same extent that it did further south, Bradley said. The counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s instead made it more acceptable to not be part of a religious group. 
He said researchers often liken the United States to a marketplace of religious ideas. 
“We see religious groups competing with each other for parishioners, but they have to be in an area where they’ve got willing customers,” Bradley said. “And I think one of the things you see not just here in Vermont, but in a lot of New England, and to a certain extent in the Northwest as well, is you just don’t have a customer base.”
As a political researcher, Bradley has noticed that religion appears to play less of a role in Vermont politics, particularly when it comes to campaigning. 
“If I’m a politician running for office up here in New England, and I say I’m an atheist, or I say religion doesn’t matter in politics, that’s much more accepted up here,” he said. 
The Pew survey found 81% of Vermonters believe people do not need to believe in God to be a moral person, compared to 68% nationwide. Therefore, Vermont politicians do not need to demonstrate their religiosity to claim moral legitimacy like they would elsewhere, Bradley said. 
In fact, “it might actually be somewhat detrimental to you here, election-wise, because (of) this perception that religion is now a tool of the right,” he said.
Yet that perception may not quite reflect a more nuanced reality. Conservative Christians are the “backbone” of the Republican Party, but they’re actually a relatively small percentage of the national population, Bradley said. 
And in Vermont, Pew data indicates some Christians do have liberal beliefs. While 45% of Vermonters said they were Christian, 84% of Vermonters said homosexuality should be accepted, one of the highest rates in the nation. That suggests that some Vermont Christians embrace pro-LGBTQ+ views. 
More than 80 churches in Vermont describe themselves as LGBTQ+ affirming on gaychurch.org, a resource for finding LGBTQ+ friendly churches. 
Bradley said it’s not uncommon to pass churches in Vermont hanging rainbow pride flags. 
“If I want to bring people into the pews … at least in Burlington, I’m not going to get up on the dias and stand there and say homosexuality is a sin,” he said. 
Belief beyond belief
At first glance, there’s a puzzle in Pew’s data about Vermont. Although 46% of Vermonters say they have no religion, only 16% say they are specifically atheist or agnostic. So who are the remaining 30%? 
“They’re just people who aren’t affiliated — it’s not that they don’t believe,” Ammerman said. When you drill down into Pew’s questions about beliefs and spirituality, many Vermonters say they do believe in a soul, an afterlife or something spiritual beyond the natural world. 
In a state filled with the beauty of nature, Ammerman said she wouldn’t be surprised to hear Vermonters say, “‘I don’t need a church. I just go out in the woods.’”
Yet that category of spirituality without religion leaves a potential gap: The role that religious institutions play in social and civic life, particularly in rural communities. 
In Missouri, Neitz conducted research on rural churches that found that they often served as critical points for services as varied as providing winter coats to children and health care access.
She’s now part of a research team looking into the ways communities replicate the cultural impact of religious institutions through a secular lens. One example she gave was Death Cafes, a movement of people gathering to openly discuss death and dying. 
“If you were a religious person and you wanted to go to the Death Cafe, I don’t think they would turn you away,” she said. “But I think it’s really founded by people who are looking for a community in that circumstance.” 
There’s also been a surge in people connecting with religion or spirituality through social media, particularly since the Covid pandemic, Bradley said. Charismatic religious leaders have increasingly found an audience through the internet instead of, or in addition to, traditional religious services. 
“People discovered that they didn’t actually have to be in a church for salvation, and that they could have salvation through the internet or through fellowship at home,” he said. 
He likened it to the rise of preaching through the radio in the 1930s or the rise of televangelism in the 1960s and 1970s. 
“When you do have a new media source come up, you usually see an explosion of religiosity using that” medium, he said. 
Some early research suggests that Gen Z, particularly Gen Z men, are becoming more religious even if they’re not attending church in person, Bradley said. Conservative Christians and Christian nationalists often tailor their online presence to appeal to young men, he said. 
At the same time, there’s been a rise in the online popularity of New Age, pagan and Wiccan beliefs. Although only 1% of Vermonters described their religion as New Age, Bradley said many of the rituals of New Age practitioners — like witchcraft, tarot or astrology — have simply been absorbed into mainstream society. 
“You see a lot of people today who are strong Christians, who also look at their horoscope, who also think about psychics or that power,” he said. 
One thing seems certain: Religion and its connection to politics will be a part of the national conversation for a long time yet. 
“It’s kind of impossible to separate religion out of politics here in America in its current state,” he said. 
“This is one of the least researched areas, and scholars are sometimes kind of afraid to get into it because it can cause so much controversy,” Bradley said. “Of course, my classes fill up like crazy.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Part of the Big Hole River closed to anglers due to low streamflows has been reopened by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
Section 2 of the river — from the North Fork of the Big Hole River to Dickie Bridge — was lifted on Wednesday. It is the only section of the river currently open for fishing, FWP said in a press release.
“The existing closure upstream of the North Fork remains in place as well as the spawning closures downstream of Dickie Bridge that took effect Oct. 1,” the FWP release said. “Annual fishing closures began Oct. 1 for sections of the Big Hole, Ruby and Beaverhead rivers to protect trout during spawning seasons.”
Significant attention has been put on declines in fish populations on the Big Hole River and the larger Jefferson River Basin. Both the state and various nonprofits are working to study and address the issue.
The reopening criteria for Section 2 reopening is water running at 140 cubic feet per second, a measure of how much water is in the river. Low streamflows closed the entirety of the Jefferson and Big Hole rivers earlier this year.
FWP will sometimes wait to get seven consecutive days of flows meeting the reopening criteria during the late summer or early fall when irrigation withdrawals might change flows, FWP spokesperson Morgan Jacobsen said.
Those criteria are spelled out in the Big Hole Drought Management Plan.
“However, if we have low water temperatures, a favorable forecast, it’s late in the fall and most irrigators have shutdown for the year, or we’re confident flows will not change much before an impending spawning closure, we may consider reopening sections sooner seven consecutive days,” Jacobsen wrote in an email.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BigHole14-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-10-09 17:59:07.582807

Federal records collected by the Iowa-based animal welfare group Bailing Out Benji show the animal dealer’s license for Stonehenge Kennels in West Union, which had long been held in the name of repeat violator Steve Kruse, is now in the name of an individual named Christine A. Snakenberg.
As a result of that change, the West Union kennel now has a clean record of regulatory compliance — although Lee County property records indicate the land and buildings where the kennel is located are still owned entirely by Kruse.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Snakenberg and Kruse for comment.
For decades, Kruse has operated Stonehenge Kennels, a dog-breeding facility that the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals calls “one of the largest puppy-mill operations in the United States.” At times, the kennel has had as many as 700 dogs on site, according to federal inspection records.
Over the years, Kruse has been cited for numerous animal-welfare violations, including throwing a bag of dead puppies at an inspector, but has continued to operate and be relicensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Last year, the ASPCA sued the USDA, alleging the agency had failed to provide adequate oversight and enforcement of federal regulations related to Kruse’s operation. In November 2024, the USDA filed a motion with the court seeking dismissal of the case based on jurisdictional issues.
The court, however, never ruled on that motion and the case has been at a standstill for nine months. On Wednesday, with the motion to dismiss still pending, U.S. District Judge Jia M. Cobb issued an order noting that the matter might now be moot since Kruse’s three-year license, issued in August 2022, had recently lapsed.
In order to rule on the November 2024 motion to dismiss, Cobb wrote, she now would like briefings from the USDA and ASPCA on the potential mootness of the case based on Kruse’s lack of a license. The judge’s order makes no mention of Snakenberg’s license at the West Union kennel, which was issued on Sept. 12, 2025 — 10 days after Kruse’s license was canceled or lapsed.
Puppy laundering alleged by ASPCA
As part of its lawsuit, the ASPCA has alleged Kruse is part of a puppy-laundering scheme that makes use of other USDA licensees. The APSCA claims the USDA “improperly approved” the licenses of two of Kruse’s Iowa associates, Brian Lichirie and Wuanita Swedlund, despite “full knowledge of the relationship between the parties.”

That lawsuit alleges that despite the Animal Welfare Act’s clear prohibition against issuing more than one license to a dog dealer, Lichirie and Swedlund each held their own license while operating kennels populated by dogs owned by Kruse.
Such arrangements are prohibited by the USDA since they can result in puppy laundering — the process of routing dogs from a serial violator to a different licensee with a relatively clean record, in order to facilitate sales to retailers in jurisdictions that ban the sale of dogs sourced from questionable operators.
The ASPCA claims the USDA wrote to Kruse nine years ago, in 2016, to inform him that federal law required him, Lichirie and Swedlund to operate under a single license. When Kruse failed to take corrective action, the ASPCA claims, the USDA continued to renew his license and never took any steps to revoke the licenses of either Lichirie or Swedlund.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeks a court order that would force the USDA to void all current licenses issued to Kruse or his associates.
Inspectors cite animal-welfare violations
According to the ASPCA, the USDA’s own inspection reports detail “horrific treatment of breeding dogs kept caged in Kruse’s massive West Point, Iowa operation, which typically holds more than 700 dogs.”
The inspectors’ reports document observations related to dogs limping and suffering from open, bleeding wounds; dogs with untreated eye infections or severe dental issues; painful fur matting; and a lack of veterinary care.
The USDA reports also allege Kruse poured hot sauce on one dog’s open wounds to keep the dog from licking them and housed other dogs in cages so small they restricted the animal’s freedom of movement. The dogs also had fecal matter on their coats and in their food bowls, the inspectors alleged.
Last month, noting the recent lapse in Kruse’s license, the ASPCA said it was not yet clear what has happened to the hundreds of dogs in his care and what the change in licensing status would mean for Kruse’s associates.
“What is clear is that a broken system kept Kruse running and that system is in desperate need of reform,” said ASPCA spokesperson Maureen Linehan. “The ASPCA is committed to working through the courts and Congress to end the practices that have allowed commercial dealers to harm dogs for so long.”

One of the state’s largest organizations supporting the LGBTQ+ community is closing its doors due to lack of state and federal funding.
After 26 years, the Pride Center of Vermont will “pause operations” on Friday, the board of directors announced Thursday.
This includes closing its trans program, the SafeSpace anti-violence hotline, HIV testing and harm-reduction services. 
“While we are pausing regular operations, we are exploring every opportunity to continue supporting our program participants, particularly SafeSpace survivors and Health & Wellness participants, and will be communicating with them directly to ensure continuity of support,” Pride Center of Vermont said in a press release Thursday afternoon.
Two people who worked at the Burlington-based organization confirmed that employees were laid off Thursday morning and informed that the organization would close by 2 p.m. Friday.
In its release, the board apologized for the short notice to staff and acknowledged the harm it has caused employees, program participants and the broader pride community it serves.
“This was not a decision anyone wanted to make. It comes after months of difficult conversations and a shared realization that we cannot adequately serve our community without first restructuring and assessing long-term sustainability,” the release states.
It is not a permanent closure, the release said, and the board is trying to raise approximately $350,000 needed to revive operations. 
“If you’ve benefited from our work, believe in our mission, or simply want to stand up for equity and community, please consider giving today,” the release states.

She says the shutdown impacts the ability to prepare for, respond to and recover from a flood in the Kansas City metro area. (Kansas Reflector screen capture)TOPEKA — A Missouri and Associated Rivers Coalition official says the federal government shutdown leaves the Kansas City metro area vulnerable to flooding.
Sarah White, a coalition board member, said the coalition works closely with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Environmental Protection Agency to bring flood protection, water use and water quality projects to the Kansas and Missouri river basins.
“Our flood response and preparedness relies on all levels of government, local, state and federal,” White said. “With the shutdown, our federal partners may not be available, which exposes our community for flood risk and also slows the response times for cleanup.”
White, who talked to reporters at a virtual news conference Thursday about the effect of the shutdown, said the absence of federal support could impact the inspections of dams, levees and environmental compliance, and delay permits for critical projects.
She noted that two of the metro area’s worst floods happened during the fall. Flash flooding in September 1977 killed 25 people and severely damaged the Country Club Plaza. In October 1998, flash flooding along several creeks caused 11 deaths, mostly as vehicles were swept away.
White appeared at the news conference with U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas; Tim DeWeese, director of the Johnson County Mental Health Center; Haley Kottler, of Kansas Appleseed; and Keely Schneider, executive director of Workforce Partnership in Kansas City, Kansas. The spoke about consequences the federal government shutdown would have on Kansas families.
Nine days into the shutdown, Congress remains at an impasse. Republicans need Democrats’ support to pass a stopgap funding measure to reopen the government, but so far have refused Democrats’ demands to restore health care subsidies that were cut as part of the so-called “big, beautiful bill” over the summer.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, says the only way forward to end the government shutdown is to find a bipartisan solution. (Kansas Reflector screen capture)
Davids said more than 25,000 federal workers in Kansas were affected by the shutdown. She said small businesses rely on federal contracts, farmers face uncertainty with agriculture programs, and people who rely on Social Security and Medicare are struggling to access basic services.
“Kansans are frustrated, and rightfully so,” Davids said. “They want solutions and not more partisanship. A shutdown erodes trust. A shutdown stalls progress. A shutdown delays action on things that matter the most, like lowering costs, keeping families safe and improving our roads and bridges.”
She said a bipartisan solution would be required to end the shutdown — “it’s math.” And she said Affordable Care Act premiums will rise 70% if not restored.
“My top priority right now is getting the government back open as quickly as possible, but Congress can chew gum and walk at the same time, so I am also working to make sure that Kansans don’t get hit with skyrocketing health care costs,” Davids said.
Kottler, who directs anti-hunger advocacy at Kansas Appleseed, said she was concerned that a prolonged shutdown would have an impact on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC.
She said more than 200,000 Kansans use SNAP short-term. Funding is in place to keep the benefits going for now, she said, but the longer the shutdown, the greater the uncertainty.
“Families already living on the edge will have to face impossible choices,” Kottler said. “No parent should be glued to the news to see if they to know if they will still have critical assistance. No senior should have to worry about politics that could take food off their plates, and no Kansas community should have to shoulder unnecessary burdens because families are left in limbo.”
DeWeese said the shutdown is threatening access to mental health services as local providers, such as the Johnson County Mental Health Center, depend on federal programs and grants. When those funds are delayed or uncertain, he said, providers may be forced to scale back services.
“When people lose income, when their housing is at risk, or they lose food assistance due to the shutdown, the likelihood of them experiencing a mental health crisis increases,” DeWeese said. “At the same time, the ability to access care becomes even more limited. This creates a dangerous cycle of instability and unmet need.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-09-133841-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-09 17:59:07.582807

Sam Garrison fields questions from reporters after being elected speaker-designate on Oct. 9, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Rep. Sam Garrison, selected Thursday to become the next speaker of the Florida House, is playing down estimates that the state could lose billions of dollars over the next few years for Medicaid.
Instead, Garrison touted Florida’s decision to not expand Medicaid access to low-income adults as a wise choice and reiterated his opposition to making the safety-net program available to low-income childless adults.
“I think we’re seeing the wisdom of the decision that was made,” Garrison said, referring to the House’s steadfast refusal to expand Medicaid under the federal health care law often referred to as Obamacare. 
“I mean, these Medicaid issues have been worked through the state House for a number of years. Speaker [Daniel] Perez has been very solid on this, very firm, on his commitment on this. We’re going to be fiscally responsible. That’s our No. 1 responsibility.”
The federal One Big Beautiful Act cuts nearly $1 trillion over a decade to Medicaid, the health care safety net for the poor, elderly, and disabled. On Wednesday, Florida Medicaid director Brian Meyer told members of a House Health Care Budget Subcommittee that Florida will lose $3.8 billion in Medicaid funds because of changes in the law championed by President Donald Trump
Specifically, beginning in 2028, Florida will have to begin reducing its directed payment program (DPP) — supplemental payments to hospitals — by 10% annually, eventually capping the payments to no more than 110% of Medicare rates.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Medicaid serves the vulnerable and is jointly administered by the state and federal government. Medicare is run by the federal government only and is for people aged 65 and older. Medicare reimbursements are far more generous than Medicaid reimbursements.
House Republicans selected Garrison, R-Fleming Island, Thursday as speaker designate; his two-year term as speaker will span the 2027 and 2028 legislative sessions, which is when the DPP cuts start to take effect.
Garrison, now chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, served as chair of the health care spending panel under former House Speaker Paul Renner and is keenly aware of Medicaid financing and helped to expand the direct-payment program.
In his acceptance speech — in which warned about being complacent — Garrison opined, “It takes commitment to master the intricacies of health care systems and Medicaid.”
Aasked by reporters about the looming DPP reductions, Garrison said: 
“Medicaid in the state of Florida is obviously a massive issue. There are a ton of people who rely on that service. We need to make sure that the money we are spending — and we are spending a lot of money on Medicaid — is getting to the people who need it, and we’re using those dollars as efficiently as possible. That’s a focus of the Speaker Perez. It’s been a focus of [House Budget Committee] Chair [Lawrence] McClure. It’s going to be a focus of [mine].”
 What is DPP?

Florida relies on Medicaid managed-care plans to deliver health care to the majority of its beneficiaries. DPP provides funding for hospitals and physicians providing inpatient and outpatient services to Medicaid managed-care enrollees.
DPP helps bridge the gap between the actual cost of caring for Medicaid patients and the amount the facilities are reimbursed for caring for the patients.
Florida does not fund its DPP program with state general revenue dollars. The required state match needed to draw down federal matching Medicaid dollars comes from a local government special assessment charged solely to hospitals. The state uses the revenues generated to draw down additional federal Medicaid funding. 
State-directed payments are used to boost payments at private, public, and cancer hospitals.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Thursday marked a new day for the Oklahoma State Board of Education, with two new board members and a new state superintendent at its meeting table.
The mood was lighter, and the board’s meeting room was, too. Window blinds were open in the usually crowded, cavelike corner of the Oklahoma State Department of Education. No line of protesters stretched to enter the building. 
Portraits of the Oklahoma Educators Hall of Fame, which former state Superintendent Ryan Walters had removed, again lined a hallway leading to the meeting space. Walters resigned from office Sept. 30, and former CareerTech center administrator Lindel Fields has been appointed to finish his term. 
In Walters’ absence, the board’s conversation centered on various school needs and accreditation issues. There was no talk of culture-war topics, which Walters made a frequent discussion point. 
Board member Mike Tinney said he noticed “less tension” in the room. 
“It seemed like everybody was just lighter, happier, more ready to get down to business,” Tinney said after the meeting.

Walters’ relationship with the board became publicly acrimonious during his final months in office. Fields, though, already has established trust with the board members, Tinney said.
Thursday’s meeting was Fields’ first as state superintendent, a position that leads both the board and the state Education Department. New board members Brian Bobek, who served on the board from 2019 to 2022, and Wes Nofire also joined.
Much of the board’s action Thursday centered on suspensions and revocations of teaching licenses. Tinney and other board members complained last month during Walters’ final meeting that too many of these cases had not been resolved quickly enough. 
After a lengthy executive session in private, the board agreed to not to revoke the teaching license of Edmond Public Schools teacher Regan Killackey and Ardmore City Schools teacher Alison Scott, whom Walters had targeted after taking issue with their social media posts about President Donald Trump.
However, the board voted to continue revocation proceedings for former Wewoka Middle School Principal Cody Barlow, who was acquitted of child molestation charges, and former Haworth Public Schools teacher Jonah Davis, whose second-degree rape charge was dismissed in McCurtain County District Court. 
Board members decided it would be moot to dismiss the revocation case against former Ringling High School football coach Philip Koons, whose highly publicized criminal charge was dropped. Koons’ teaching license has expired, and he will have the opportunity to reapply for certification, said Fields’ chief of staff, Tom Newell.
Three other teachers had their revocation cases withdrawn, and two more received a formal reprimand in lieu of their teaching certifications being suspended. Eight others voluntarily surrendered their certifications.

The board voted to suspend the teaching licenses of six educators, including a man charged with committing a double homicide. 
It also vacated the license revocation of Rick Dillinger, an Elk City Public Schools agriculture teacher, and scheduled his case for a new hearing. Dillinger never received proper notice of his original revocation hearing and therefore was unable to respond and present a defense, according to the board’s agenda.
These cases impact people’s lives, so addressing them was a top priority for Thursday’s meeting, said Tara Thompson, a spokesperson for the state Education Department. 
A lengthy list of other procedural items also were approved, such as waivers granting districts flexibility with their textbook funds, library media centers and alternative education programs.
“There’s catching up to do on just about everything right now,” Thompson said after the meeting.
Other matters that the board traditionally would have accomplished before October are still delayed, particularly a vote on accreditation for the 2025-26 academic year. A school or district’s accreditation status outlines whether it committed any deficiencies in the previous year.
The board on Thursday considered assigning 16 school districts the status of “accredited with warning” for failing to correct deficiencies identified in prior years. Ultimately, board members tabled the matter until their next meeting Oct. 23.
There was one exception, though. 
Bobek proposed approving the “accredited with warning” status for Western Heights Public Schools. “Accredited with warning” is an improvement for Western Heights, which has been under the more serious status of “accredited with probation” since 2021.
The rest of the board agreed with a unanimous vote.
“I want to applaud that district,” Bobek said during the meeting. “This is the first time they’re moving up. I applaud their leadership for what they’ve done.”

(Photo courtesy of the North Dakota Aeronautics Commission)Air travel at three rural North Dakota airports supported by a federal program will continue despite the government shutdown.
The U.S. Department of Transportation secured an additional $41 million on Wednesday to keep the Essential Air Service program operating through Nov. 2. The program, which was set to run out of funding Sunday, supports air travel from Dickinson, Jamestown and Devils Lake.
“As of right now, all passengers can be assured for the very near future that air service will continue at all of our airports in North Dakota,” said Kyle Wanner, director of the North Dakota Aeronautics Commission.
The Essential Air Service program was designed to help rural communities connect to a larger region and provided money to airlines on routes that tend to have fewer passengers, he said.
“Having air service within these communities is essential for businesses to want to come into these locations and for these communities to grow,” Wanner said. 
North Dakota rolls out low-interest loans to aid federal workers during shutdown

If the government shutdown continues past Nov. 2, Wanner said he expects SkyWest, an airline headquartered in Utah that provides service to North Dakota’s rural airports, will continue operations.
In a statement to the North Dakota Monitor on Wednesday, SkyWest said it will work with each community in the event of a longer-term government shutdown.
“It is our intent to honor our service commitments, including those under the federal EAS program who rely on SkyWest’s reliable air service as an essential economic lifeline,” the airline said in a statement.
Katie Hemmer, director of the Jamestown Regional Airport, said commercial airline service in Jamestown would not exist without the federal program.
“It really is in its title, essential,” Hemmer said. “It’s what creates this connection for all rural areas, not just North Dakota.”
Airline carriers that use Essential Air Service program subsidies have a 90-day reimbursement window for expenses that provide a cushion for any funding lapses, Hemmer said.
She said she also worries about Jamestown’s Transportation Safety Administration employees being forced to work without pay during the shutdown. However, she said she is grateful to see the state is stepping in with its Furloughed Federal Employee Relief Program to offer low-interest loans to those who lose wages during the shutdown.
“Especially in North Dakota, we have such low unemployment and it is very difficult to keep entities like TSA staffed,” Hemmer said.
Air traffic control staffing steady, but stress during shutdown worries DOT

In a statement, Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said the near lapse in funding for rural air service is  another reason Senate Democrats should reopen the government.
“Thankfully, the Trump administration was able to secure additional funding to sustain the EAS program for now,” Hoeven said. “We appreciate the EAS carriers, including SkyWest, for their commitment to maintain their service to the Dickinson, Jamestown and Devils Lake communities while they navigate this uncertainty.”

The national nonprofit released a map and report Thursday compiling how many children under the age of 5 across the U.S. rely on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) — a program that provides free food and infant care staples to participants, and one of many federal initiatives impacted by the ongoing federal government shutdown.
According to the report, there are nearly 50,000 children in Iowa under 5 who rely on WIC, representing close to 27% of the state’s population in this category. In the U.S., the report states just under 5.3 million children, or around 29% of the population, are WIC aid recipients.

“Trump and Congressional Republicans have driven America headfirst into a government shutdown. It is poor women and children who will feel the impacts first and worst,” said Food & Water Watch Managing Director of Policy and Litigation Mitch Jones in a statement. “Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley need to put food back on the table for struggling families by passing a bipartisan spending bill that protects food access.”
Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture stated that as of May, nearly 63,000 people in Iowa were signed up for WIC. The Iowa Hunger Coalition in an online post stated WIC has the highest risk of reducing or halting services “more than any other federal nutrition program.”
States do have the ability to use their own funding to keep WIC going for their residents, according to Stateline reporting. The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services did not respond Thursday to questions about allocating funding to WIC in Iowa.
On Sept. 30, just before the shutdown began, National WIC Association President and CEO Georgia Machell said in an online release the program had enough funds to run for “one to two weeks,” but the fact that the shutdown began at the start of the new fiscal year means the program could “rapidly” go through its remaining funding.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X this week that President Donald Trump’s administration will use revenue from tariffs to provide additional funding to WIC, but gave no details as to how much funding would be provided, how soon it would come and for how long it would stretch.
The National WIC Association stated in an Oct. 7 press release that while the aid is welcomed, it is not a permanent solution to sustain the program and questions still need to be answered about how it will work. A statement from Machell in the release said WIC recipients “need long-term stability, not short-term uncertainty.”
“There is no substitute for Congress doing its job,” Machell said in the Oct. 7 statement. “WIC needs full-year funding, not just temporary lifelines. It’s imperative that leaders in Washington come together and act immediately to ensure that millions of families can continue to access the critical nutrition, care, and support they count on every day.”

,DC,2025-10-09 21:10:40+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Former governors, state AGs weigh in on Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/former-governors-state-ags-weigh-trumps-deployment-national-guard-troops,,"President Donald Trump’s novel use of National Guard troops for law enforcement purposes has reopened a debate over states’ authority to control police powers, as dueling briefs from current and former state leaders filed in Illinois’ lawsuit against the president show.A bipartisan group of former governors said Trump’s federalization and deployment of National Guard members to Chicago to control “modest” protests upended the careful balance between state and federal powers. At the same time, a group of 17 current Republican attorneys general told the court they supported the administration’s move that they said was necessary to protect immigration enforcement officers.Both groups submitted friend-of-the-court briefs in the suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division brought by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson to block the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops to the nation’s third-largest city. Trump on Wednesday called for the arrest of Johnson and Pritzker for not assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, a provocative demand that raised further concerns about his administration’s relationship with state leaders.The bipartisan group supported Pritzker and Johnson’s call for a restraining order to block the deployment, while the Republicans said the restraining order should be denied.Democratic attorneys general back Oregon In another case, in which Oregon is challenging Trump’s order to deploy troops to Portland, Democratic governors or attorneys general in 23 states and the District of Columbia argued in support of the state’s position.Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was among those siding with Oregon, said Wednesday he did so to “put an end to the dangerous overreach of power we are seeing with Donald Trump’s Guard deployments.”The brief was also signed by Democratic state officials from Washington state, Maryland, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Kansas and Kentucky and the District of Columbia’s attorney general.Former govs say deployment robs state authorityThe federalist structure of the U.S. government, which bestows powers to both the federal and state governments, leaves broad police power to the states, the bipartisan group wrote. Sending military forces to conduct law enforcement would unbalance that arrangement, they said.That group includes Democratic former Govs. Jerry Brown of California, Steve Bullock of Montana, Mark Dayton of Minnesota, Jim Doyle of Wisconsin, Parris Glendening and Martin O’Malley of Maryland, Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, Christine Gregoire, Jay Inslee and Gary Locke of Washington, Tony Knowles of Alaska, Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, Janet Napolitano of Arizona, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado, Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, Steve Sisolak of Nevada, Eliot Spitzer of New York, Ted Strickland of Ohio, Tom Vilsack of Iowa and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania.GOP former Govs. Arne Carlson of Minnesota, Bill Graves of Kansas, Marc Racicot of Montana, Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey also signed the brief.“The present deployment of military resources, based on an assertion of nearly unfettered federal authority, is unlawful,” they wrote. “The president’s assertion of authority to deploy military troops on domestic soil based on his unreviewable discretion, and without the cooperation and coordination of state authorities, threatens to upset the delicate balance of state and federal authority that underlies our constitutional order.”The Trump administration misunderstands the section of federal law that Trump has relied on to federalize National Guard troops, the group said. The administration’s claim that only the president can decide if the conditions are met for National Guard units to be federalized “not only undermines state sovereignty but also deprives governors of a critical public safety tool,” they wrote.“If federalization of the National Guard is unreviewable, a president motivated by ill will or competing policy priorities could divert Guard resources away from critical state needs, including natural disasters or public health crises,” they continued.States need ICE enforcement, GOP govs sayThe group of current Republican attorneys general argued their states are harmed by the protests in Chicago and other cities that impede federal ICE officers from doing their jobs.The attorneys general are Brenna Bird of Iowa, Austin Knudsen of Montana, Gentner Drummond of Oklahoma, Alan Wilson of South Carolina, Steve Marshall of Alabama, Tim Griffin of Arkansas, James Uthmeier of Florida, Chris Carr of Georgia, Raúl R. Labrador of Idaho, Todd Rokita of Indiana, Lynn Fitch of Mississippi, Catherine Hanaway of Missouri, Michael T. Hilgers of Nebraska, Marty Jackley of South Dakota, Ken Paxton of Texas and John B. McCuskey of West Virginia.They described the protests in Chicago as acts of violence that require a strong response.“Rather than protest peacefully, some of those protests became violent, threatening federal officers, harming federal property, and certainly impeding enforcement of federal law,” they wrote. “President Trump’s deployment of a small number of National Guard members to defend against this lawlessness is responsible, constitutional, and authorized by statute.”The attorneys general added that their states had been harmed by immigrants in the country without legal authorization who had settled in their states, which they said gave the president a public interest purpose in calling up troops to assist. “The President’s action of federalizing the National Guard furthers the public interest because it allows ICE agents to continue to perform their statutory duties of identifying, apprehending, and removing illegal aliens, which is the only way to protect the States from the harms caused by illegal immigration,” they wrote.",,,,2025-10-09 17:59:07.582807

Hundreds of individuals from the cannabis industry came out in opposition to the proposal last week, gathering on the Capitol lawn and lining the halls of the building as lawmakers worked to finalize the state budget.
While the policy won support from both sides of the aisle, its detractors were similarly bipartisan as some lawmakers warned that an additional 24% tax on wholesale marijuana could carry a host of issues, from smothering small businesses to expanding the black market, and even opening the state up to a potential constitutional challenge. 
Although Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer put her pen to the new tax law on Tuesday, the future of the law has already been challenged, with the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association filing a complaint the same day, arguing the law improperly alters the law initiated by voters when they agreed to legalize marijuana in 2018.

Navigating the new tax
Under the new policy, which is scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, the first sale or transfer between a marijuana business and a retailer is subject to a 24% tax. If a retailer has cultivated or processed its own marijuana, the Michigan Department of Treasury will collect a tax based on the wholesale price on the total amount of marijuana the retailer cultivates and processes for sale. 
Denise Pollicella, an attorney at Omnus Law who largely works with clients in the cannabis industry, said the details on how the tax will be administered – including the tax rate for companies who produce their own retail product – will be fleshed out by the Department of Treasury as the law takes effect. 
She noted that the tax applies to products in the recreational adult-use industry, not CBD, hemp or medical marijuana. 
However, Pollicella emphasized that the tax will touch each part of the industry, as marijuana businesses raise their prices to compensate for the additional tax.
If the price of recreational marijuana increases significantly in order to cover the price of the tax, there will come a time when it is significantly less expensive for consumers to get their marijuana on the black market, Pollicella said
“One of the biggest complaints and concerns of the cannabis industry since 2018 is that once marijuana was legalized in Michigan, law enforcement basically either stopped altogether trying to enforce unregulated marijuana trafficking, or they were stopped from enforcing it because there weren’t enough teeth left in the laws to allow prosecutors to actually prosecute it,” Pollicella said. 
The unregulated market in Michigan never went away, Pollicella said, though it has shrunk and will continue to shrink provided customers have access to a better alternative – such as safe and accessible marijuana. 
“Those are the two things we have always fought for. Safe and accessible, meaning, it’s been lab tested so you know it’s not laced with fentanyl or cat hair or mold, you know, it’s not gonna make you sick,” Pollicella said. “And then that it’s accessible, so that a person who really wants to try it or use it can go into a well-lit commercial facility in a commercial district of their municipality, in the daytime and have a safe experience and access a wide variety of marijuana products.” 
In an email to the Michigan Advance, Danny Wimmer, a spokesperson for the Department of Attorney General said their office has faced “serious problems” in prosecuting illegal, large-scale marijuana growing operations in the years since recreational marijuana was legalized in Michigan.

“The criminal statutes protecting Michigan residents from these practices are squarely outdated,” Wimmer said, calling the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act insufficient in punishing illegal grow operations and incompatible with the state’s current legal marijuana landscape. 
The department is also aware that international criminal organizations are travelling to Michigan specifically to set up shop due to the state’s lax laws on illegal cultivation, Wimmer said. 
Alongside concerns about the black market, Pollicella also pointed to the tax burden borne by marijuana businesses. 
“If you put more of a tax burden on these companies, and they’re not allowed to renew their licenses, they’re going to start going out of business,” Pollicella said. “If there are no more businesses in this industry, who in the heck are you going to collect the taxes from?”
Because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, marijuana business owners are barred from taking advantage of tax breaks, save for the cost of goods. Pollicella explained that while that exception helps grow facilities and processing facilities, retailers are taking it on the chin. 
Federal law also bars marijuana businesses from receiving bankruptcy protections and insurance rates are often triple what other businesses are charged, Pollicella said. 
Additionally, the state already charges a 10% excise tax which is collected at the retailer alongside the state’s 6% sales tax.

“The retail facilities are the ones on very thin margins right now,” Pollicella said. “I already have a lot of clients who are small operators – one or two shops, maybe five – they don’t have the economy of scale, they’re not operating at a big enough scale to withstand this. I mean, they’re already either closing or, you know, planning to close after the first of the year.”
On top of the taxes the industry already pays to the state and their licensing fees, Pollicella said marijuana businesses also face burdensome regulatory fees and fines that can range up to $100,000. 
“It’s extraordinarily expensive to be in this industry and have a license,” Pollicella said. “The fact that the House and Senate passed this bill either knowing what kind of burden the industry is already under, or not having the curiosity to find out what kind of burden this industry is under was not responsible.”
The impact
Jerry Millen owns the Greenhouse of Walled Lake, the first licensed medical and recreational marijuana dispensary in Oakland County. The shop caters to a more adult clientele, Millen said, with the average age of 44. 
“We cater to seniors. We have a lot of 80 and 90 year olds that come in every day,” Millen said. 
In an interview with the Advance on Tuesday, Millen pushed back on the notion that the new tax is only hitting “stoners” and “weedheads,” emphasizing the medicinal uses for marijuana. 
“I see seniors every day that can’t sleep or have arthritic pain. I work with cancer patients,” Millen said. “I’ve seen this product as a medicine for 15 years now, and I wouldn’t have believed it myself. I didn’t when I first started, until I saw and I met these people.”

Millen slammed the 24% excise tax as a money grab from the state, which will appear as price gouging to customers who are unaware of the tax.
Imagine shopping at a dispensary with a 16% tax on marijuana on your receipt, and then going in the next, with a 40% tax on your bill, Millen said. 
“You’re gonna lose your mind,” he said.
However, the 24% tax won’t appear on the receipt, as the cost is hidden behind the retailer, Millen said. 
Kevin May, part owner of Glacier Cannabis, a craft cannabis cultivator in Manchester, Mich., said there’s no way for wholesalers to eat that cost, leaving dispensaries to pick up the tab and pass the cost along to the customer. 
Pollicella, Millen and May all agreed, when it comes to the new tax, the customer is the one who will feel the impact. 
“That’s not because the growers or the dispensaries are making another penny, they’re still not making anything. It’s still a struggling industry that way. Because it’s already oversaturated, people are about to go out of business,” May said. 
Although patients with a medical marijuana card do not have to pay the 10% tax on marijuana sales at the dispensary, Millen said many people have gotten rid of their card following the legalization of recreational marijuana in the state. He warned that a 24% increase in price could bar some medical marijuana patients from getting what they need. 
While Millen said his older clientele are not the type to turn to the black market, a resurgent black market creates concerns for those who are underage. 
“Even the people that are against marijuana should have a problem with this, because at the end of the day, marijuana is legal, it’s going to be sold,” Millen said. “But now that the black market can resurge, that means your kids are probably going to get a hold of some black market products that are going to be unsafe. So you should be going against this tax too.”
The new tax will also cost people jobs, Millen said, with “mom and pop” growers, processors and dispensaries in threat of going out of business.

While there are roughly 47,000 cannabis industry jobs in the state, Pollicella said there are easily another 40,000 that help support the industry, including accountants, attorneys, tax preparers, real estate developers and whole banking divisions. 
Although May and Pollicella disagreed with the notion that the tax would wholly decimate the industry within the state, both agreed that it would likely result in a consolidation of the industry. 

“There are some people in this industry who are wealthy, but I will also say this: a majority of the people in this industry haven’t even made their money back yet,” Pollicella said, emphasizing that the tax increase will cost people their livelihood during an uncertain time when people are already struggling to find jobs. 
While there will be people laid off in the short term, May said those people will still be able to find jobs as successful companies pick up real estate and work to fill the holes left in the market. 
Though some opponents of the tax raised concerns that an increase of prices could drive away customers in communities on the border of the state, May disagreed, noting that people who buy their weed in Michigan have enjoyed the cheapest prices in the nation. 
In border states like Ohio, prices are still high, the product is not as high quality and it’s sold in strange quantities, May said. 
“I still believe the border stores are going to boom,” May said. “If you’re weak and you’re not operating properly and you’re having a hard time with your costs staying in line, you’re going to have a real big issue now.”

Brockman reportedly hospitalized as calls mount for his resignation,Christine Zhu,,,,,https://ncnewsline.com/2025/10/09/nc-rep-brockman-reportedly-hospitalized-as-calls-mount-for-his-resignation/,Brockman was scheduled to appear in front of the Guilford County District Court at 2 p.m. on Thursday. Court documents say he was hospitalized and his appearance has been delayed until Friday.,"Rep. Cecil Brockman (Photo: ncleg.net)Rep. Cecil Brockman’s court appearance in Greensboro has been postponed after he was reportedly hospitalized, according to court documents.
Brockman was scheduled to appear in front of the Guilford County District Court at 2 p.m. on Thursday. Court documents say he was hospitalized and his appearance has been delayed until Friday.
The 41-year-old Democrat who represents Guilford County was arrested Wednesday by the State Bureau of Investigation and charged with two counts of indecent liberties with a child and two counts of statutory rape of a 15-year-old victim, according to a Guilford County magistrate’s order issued Wednesday.
The order accuses Brockman of trying to “use his status” as a state lawmaker to get information about the victim while the victim was in the hospital.
Brockman is being held without bond.
The lawmaker has claimed indigence for the purpose of legal representation. The county public defender’s office told NC Newsline no attorney has been appointed yet, and it may be days before one is.
Brockman’s legislative assistant declined to comment.
Meanwhile, a growing bipartisan chorus of elected leaders called for Brockman’s immediate resignation.
Former governor and 2026 U.S. Senate candidate Roy Cooper is the latest to call for Brockman to step down, saying the charges are “disturbing and disqualifying.”
Democratic Gov. Josh Stein described the charges as “extremely serious and deeply troubling.”
“While the legal process has yet to play out, it’s clear he cannot effectively serve his constituents and should resign immediately,” Stein said in a statement.
Other Democratic lawmakers like House Minority Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) and Rep. Bryan Cohn (D-Granville, Vance) also issued statements urging Brockman to resign.
“As we continue to learn more about the allegations against Rep. Brockman this morning, it has become clear that he is unable to continue serving in the House of Representatives,” Reives said.
“Let me be clear: the allegations alone are grave enough to demand accountability,” Cohn said in a statement.
Brockman, who is in his sixth term in the House, has sometimes played a pivotal role in moving Republican-penned legislation.
The N.C. House GOP is one seat shy of a three-fifths supermajority. Brockman is one of several House Democrats who occasionally vote with the Republicans or are absent during key votes on veto overrides.
He has been criticized by fellow Democrats in the past, and narrowly fought off a primary challenge in 2024.
Across the aisle, Republicans including House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) joined in on requests for Brockman’s resignation.
Hall described the charges as “shocking and extremely serious.”
“Given the evidence that’s publicly known, he should resign immediately so these charges do not distract from the work of the North Carolina House.”
The option to expel
Should Brockman choose not to resign, his fellow N.C. House lawmakers could vote to expel him. It’s a rare occurrence, but not unheard of.
The last time a House member was expelled was in 2008, when former Rep. Thomas Wright (D-New Hanover) refused to resign despite facing criminal charges of mishandling of nearly $340,000 in campaign and nonprofit funds. Wright maintained his innocence.
After a unanimous finding of probable cause by the bipartisan House Ethics committee, the House voted 109-5 to expel Wright. He was the first member to be expelled in more than a century, and was convicted and sentenced to prison a few weeks later.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Brockman_featured.jpg,,,2025-10-09 17:59:07.582807

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the weeks since the launch of the Memphis Safe Community Task Force, one thing has become increasingly clear: there was never a concrete public safety strategy laid out — but there is a communications strategy. Or, at least, there’s been an effective narrative machine that benefits from the absence of one.
From the very beginning, there was no public briefing that outlined how success would be measured, which agencies would lead which components, or how different arms of law enforcement and government would coordinate their work. There was no press push to demand these details either. I asked these questions directly but never received an honest or concrete response.  That vacuum left room for a dangerous sleight of hand: letting daily press releases become the story instead of the actual outcomes on the ground.
Now the U.S. Attorney General’s Office can release arrest numbers every day — neat numbers designed to sound like progress. “Five hundred and sixty two arrests and 144 illegal guns seized…” Local law enforcement saying, “1800 traffic tickets written…” The DOJ has gone as far as to state publicly that they do not have a breakdown of the numbers.  
Nevertheless, headlines are produced. Press conferences are staged. The story is repeated.
But since this information is not being disaggregated, we don’t know who’s being arrested. We don’t know for what. We don’t know if those arrests have any actual relationship to violent crime trends. We don’t know what happens to those cases after the flashing lights fade. And we don’t know what other resources — violence prevention dollars, intervention programs, community-based safety strategies — are being displaced or defunded while the spectacle of “tough on crime” gets the spotlight.
This is classic Copaganda: emphasizing the appearance of action through law enforcement activity without ever proving its efficacy or necessity.
The numbers game
Without a concrete plan, the “numbers” become a kind of substitute policy. Arrest totals are presented as if they represent community safety. But high arrest numbers don’t automatically translate into lower crime. We’ve seen this before — here and in cities across the country.
Without context, arrest stats tell us nothing about whether the approach is working. They don’t tell us whether arrests are concentrated in Black neighborhoods. They don’t tell us whether most arrests are for serious violent offenses or low-level infractions. And they certainly don’t tell us if the communities most impacted feel any safer. But the headlines keep circulating because narrative control isn’t about telling the whole story; it’s about keeping the loudest story on repeat.
Media complicity
Local media hasn’t done a good job of contextualizing what’s happening. Instead of interrogating the data or asking tough follow-up questions, most outlets are simply relaying the daily numbers as if they’re facts that speak for themselves.
But numbers don’t speak for themselves. Numbers are framed. Numbers are used. Numbers are weaponized. Figures don’t lie. But liars do figures. 
If you strip away the headlines and the blue lights, what we have is not a comprehensive public safety strategy. It’s a public relations campaign with police power at its center. And the more these numbers are amplified without interrogation, the harder it becomes for the public to separate what’s true from what’s simply loud.
Political silence
Too many elected officials have been quiet. Not necessarily because they agree with what’s happening — but because few are willing to push back publicly on law enforcement narratives for fear of being labeled “soft on crime.”
But pressing for transparency isn’t being soft on crime. Asking for disaggregated data isn’t obstruction. Demanding a clear strategy isn’t being anti-police. It’s about accountability.
If our local leadership isn’t willing to insist on concrete metrics and transparent reporting, then the Memphis Safe Task Force will continue to operate in a kind of unchecked PR loop: action, press release, headline, repeat.
Accountability or spectacle
What should have happened from the beginning — and still can happen — is a clear articulation of strategy and accountability:

Disaggregated reporting: Break down arrests and stops by type, charge, location, demographic, and outcome.
Defined goals and timelines: Tell the public what “success” actually looks like.
Independent evaluation: Don’t let the same agencies driving the operation grade their own work.
Transparency about resource allocation: How much is being spent on enforcement versus intervention and prevention?

Public safety isn’t about how many people are stopped, searched, or arrested. It’s about whether communities are safer, healthier, and more stable. It’s about whether the root causes of harm — poverty, unemployment, lack of mental health resources, disinvestment — are being addressed with the same urgency as press conferences.
Right now, what we have is not a safety plan. It’s a spectacle. And as long as it remains a spectacle, the real problems will remain unaddressed — even as the numbers get louder.

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)More than 2 1/2 years after Florida dropped its association with a bipartisan national voter database, Secretary of State Cord Byrd said Wednesday that the state has formed agreement with “multiple states” to share that voter information.
“Most of our transient people are coming from Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, the states close to you,” Byrd told the House Government Operations Subcommittee. “So we’ve entered into memorandums of understanding in data sharing.”
How many states Florida has such MOUs with isn’t clear, but the Phoenix has learned that Florida has such agreements with at least four states: Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, and West Virginia.
Byrd announced in March 2023 that after 3 1/2 years, Florida was terminating its membership in the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), then a consortium of 30 states that shared data with each other to keep voter rolls accurate. The Sunshine State was one of several mostly conservative-led states to announce withdrawal, and it took place on the same day that President Donald Trump called on all Republican governors to leave ERIC.
“All Republican governors should immediately pull out of ERIC, the terrible Voter Registration System that ‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up,” the president posted on Truth Social. “It is a fools game for Republicans.”
Byrd said at that time that Florida had dropped out of ERIC because the organization was unwilling to address issues of election integrity, saying that the state had tried to back reforms to increase protections for personal information of Florida’s citizens, “but these protections were refused.” He also cited concerns about “ERIC’s potential partisan leanings.”
But on Wednesday, Byrd said the problem with ERIC was that it banned member states from sharing information about non-U.S. citizens.
“That’s a big red flag,” he said. “So we want to look at everybody who has the potential to be an illegal voter, whether they’re a citizen or a non-citizen … so that was one of the big red flags to me.”
Byrd added that the memorandums of understanding that Florida has signed with other states “don’t prohibit us from identifying non-citizen voters who may be registered.”
One of those MOUs formed an alliance with Alabama, as part of the Alabama Voter Integrity Database (AVID). The Sunshine State is one of nine to coordinate voter information with Alabama. Other (red) states to do so include Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.
AVID’s website notes that the program relies on state records, the U.S. Postal Service’s national change of address file, and the Social Security death index. However, those data-sharing agreements include driver’s license information.
According to the ERIC website, its shared data include voter registration and motor vehicle information. ERIC also obtains death data from the Social Security Administration and the National Change of Address Program from the U.S. Postal Service.
Another state that Florida has formalized a data sharing agreement with is Ohio.
Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced partnerships with Florida, Virginia, and West Virginia, according to a September 2023 press release. Each state “will implement state-specific data sharing and security protocols to allow for the secure exchange of voter information, giving both states in the agreement the ability to analyze records for evidence of cross-state voter fraud and duplicate voter registrations.”
The Phoenix has also been able to obtain memorandums of understanding signed in 2023 between Byrd and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and between Florida Department of State general counsel Joseph S. Van de Bogart and West Virginia’s then-deputy Secretary of State chief-of-staff Chuck Flannery.
“We have to tailor each MOU to each state, but we are entering into those agreements,” Byrd said.
He added that without a national voter database housed with the federal government, “we are doing what we can with the states that we have the most likely issue with voters moving in and out of state frequently to ensure that we’re catching people who are registered in more than one place.”
A spokesperson for the Florida Department of State promised Wednesday to look into how many states have such MOUs with Florida, but had not provided such information by late Thursday afternoon.

Norton Jameson Annex at the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — There are fewer parolees on the run in South Dakota today than at any point since 2010, the Board of Pardons and Paroles heard Thursday.
In recent years, there have been around 3,600 people on parole supervision in the state at any given time. In early 2022, nearly 500 of them were classified as “absconders,” meaning they’d lost touch with their parole officer.
The current numbers are 3,705 parolees, including 92 absconders. 
Parole officers create specialty unit to target parolees in hiding

The low number is a high water mark for parole officers, said Kayla Stucky, assistant director of parole services for the Department of Corrections.
“It’s a big deal,” said Stucky. “We can’t really have a potluck because we’re spread out all over the state, but we’re all pretty excited about it.”
Stucky began working with parolees in 2014, and she told the board she’s never seen fewer than 100 absconders. The last time the number was lower than that was in 2010, she said, and there were about 1,000 fewer total parolees at the time.
The number of absconders who parole agents can reasonably expect to catch is even smaller, Stucky said. About 75% of the absconders are Native American, she said, and about half of those absconders are on reservation land and outside state jurisdiction. 
“That leaves roughly 30 absconders that we can apprehend,” Stucky said.
Multiple changes behind drop
There are a host of reasons for the dramatic drop. In late 2022, the state began to pull together a team it would later dub the Absconder Apprehension Unit, a group that collaborates more closely than parole agents had in the past with entities like the Minnehaha County Sheriff’s Office and the U.S. Marshals Service.
In a press release issued five hours after Stucky’s presentation, the Department of Corrections said U.S. Marshals have captured 250 people across the U.S. in the two years since the partnership began.
State officials: Specialty parole unit helps trim fugitive parolee numbers in half

Policy changes have also played a role, Stucky told the board. Agents now use a checklist to determine who qualifies as an absconder based on their overall pattern of behavior. Are they ducking calls? Have they quit their job? Have they recently broken up with their partner and moved out?
“Just because a person misses an office visit doesn’t mean we need to issue an attempt to locate,” Stucky said. 
Board Vice Chair Kirsten Aasen homed in on that factor on Thursday. She wanted to know how much of the change could be tied to a change in absconder criteria.
“That’s the easy way to eliminate absconders,” Aasen said. “You just don’t call them that anymore.”
Stucky said the change is less about classification and more about the way agents work with parolees. In the past, parole agents would issue an absconder warrant for people who didn’t show up and couldn’t be found for seven to 14 days. If that person showed up at the office as an absconder or on some other violation, they’d be taken to jail.
Agents are now able to detain parolees in the office, Stucky said, because of a policy change. While detained in an agent’s office, they’ll fill out job applications or work on problem-solving or other life skills exercises. They’re sometimes asked to come back the next day for a few hours. They do, Stucky said, because they’re less worried about getting locked up again.
“It’s so much more beneficial than sending them back to jail,” said Stucky.
Changes to state law
Aasen was pleased to hear that “at least on paper, parole officers are working with” parolees more closely. She also wanted to know about a change to the state’s drug ingestion law. Until July, failed drug tests could draw felony charges. Now, the first two offenses are misdemeanors.
“It always made sense to me,” Aasen said, that parolees who use drugs would hide if they knew they’d fail a drug test.
The law hasn’t been in effect for long enough to tell what difference it might make, Stucky said. But she did proffer that the change might help agents work with people who struggle with addiction and point them in the right direction.
“It gives us a little more leeway, because it’s a misdemeanor,” Stucky said.
Board Chair Myron Rau said he suspects another factor could soon come to influence the makeup of the parole population. A 2024 bill dubbed “Truth in Sentencing” requires people convicted of certain violent crimes to serve between 85% and 100% of their sentence before being eligible for release.
Rau said that’s going to keep certain people off the streets for longer.
“We had to break that news to a guy this week who was in that category,” he said.

A group representing thousands of residents from Altadena and surrounding areas said Edison’s proposed payouts exclude some residents and underpay others.




Weeks after Southern California Edison announced initial details of its compensation program for survivors of the deadly Eaton Fire, residents are pushing back. In an open letter to the company released this week, a group representing thousands of people from Altadena and the surrounding areas laid out their concerns with the program.
In the letter and at a press conference today, they said they are most frustrated that the maps Edison uses to determine eligibility exclude some impacted residents from the program and that the company’s payout offers incorrectly assume that residents will receive the full value of their property insurance policies. They are also worried about the fact that children will receive less compensation than adults and that the company is not offering to pay for testing in local schools for toxins released by the fire. 
“We’re trying to prevent a situation where the most vulnerable people take way less than they should be getting,” Joy Chen, executive director of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network, said in an interview with CalMatters.
Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford did not address specifics about the criticisms, providing a written statement that the company’s program “offers a streamlined approach to quickly and fairly provide compensation to eligible community members affected by the Eaton Fire.”  He added that “we will update the program as needed” based on concerns shared by community members.
The concerns about Edison’s plan mirrors similar criticism three years ago of how Pacific Gas & Electric paid survivors of two fires that its equipment was responsible for, the Mosquito and Dixie fires.
The Eaton Fire, which is believed to have started by Altadena, killed 19 people and burned more than 14,000 acres of Los Angeles County in January. While state authorities have yet to release an official cause of the fire, the leading hypothesis is a reenergized transmission line Edison owned. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the utility last month for reimbursement of the cost to rehabilitate 8,000 acres of national forest the fire burned, alleging Edison was responsible for the blaze. 
Edison announced a program this summer to rapidly compensate the thousands of survivors of the fire in exchange for survivors waiving their right to sue the utility over the blaze. It released more specific details about the coverage in recent weeks, hosting several “community input workshops” in late September to collect feedback on the program’s current structure. 
Unanswered questions
But residents said the format of the workshops – a structured set of questions asked by proctors who were not experts on the compensation program – was too limited to adequately capture the breadth of their concerns.
Chief among them is who can participate. Edison’s program limits compensation to structures marked as damaged or destroyed on the “Damage Inspection Notification Summary” map created by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, as well as those in the perimeter map of the fire. The survivors’ network said this excludes many community members who were affected and that geographic restrictions should be lifted in favor of a system that focuses on actual damages. 
Rebuilding quickly is another concern. Many survivors, the group’s letter said, are hindered by “the gap – the difference between what insurance pays and what it actually costs to rebuild.” Edison’s program, the network argued, does not go far enough to close this. Instead, the utility deducts the full value of someone’s relevant insurance policy from what it will pay out, even if the insurer has not paid out the full amount, limiting what the network said is fair compensation.
And the funding available through Edison for temporary housing – capped at 10% of a home’s value before the fire over 42 months – isn’t enough to rent similar accommodation in nearby areas, the group said.
“They’re covering what insurance covers and not covering what [insurance companies’] don’t,” Chen said. But unlike opt-in insurance policies with known limitations, “we never agreed to be victims of Edison’s fire.”
Edison, the letter said, should also revisit how children are treated. Under its current offering, children would receive much less compensation than adults. Non-economic damages for smoke damage survivors, for example, is $20,000 for adults and $5,000 for children. And testing for toxins at nearby schools is not included under the current plan, something Chen said is important given the age of the community’s homes. 
“Most of Altadena’s houses were built before 1976, and that means there’s lead and all this toxic contamination that are in our houses [and] our schools,” she said.
Edison’s Monford said the money for the compensation program comes from multiple sources. The first $1 billion will be from Edison’s customer-funded insurance, followed by the state’s wildfire fund, which covers damages from fires started by the three large investor-owned utilities’ equipment.
Pacific Gas & Electric had a similar program for two fires that its equipment was responsible for – the Mosquito and Dixie fires – and it also faced concerns about not paying enough to make survivors whole were raised.
Resident Ed Meyers’ Altadena home was deemed a total loss after the fire, as was he and his wife’s pet store in town. They plan to rebuild their home to match how it was before the fire struck. But where the money will come from and how long that will take is not clear. 
“There’s a lot to think about,” Meyers said. “Will I have enough money in the short term to rebuild? How quickly will I need additional capital to rebuild? Can I get another loan versus taking what Edison’s paying out? I’m looking at my age, if I take money now and I can’t get any money later, is that what I want to do? I’m almost 60.”

(Photo by Andrew Fraieli for Colorado Newsline)U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet said in a press call Thursday that Republicans in Congress are making life harder for working Americans by refusing to negotiate with Democrats on health care. 
For the sixth time, Republicans voted down a proposal from Democrats to fund the government and extend enhanced premium tax credits on Wednesday, Bennet said. Insurance providers will send notices of increased premiums to those who purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act in the coming weeks. Bennet said 80% of Americans support extending the credits because of that anticipated increase in cost. 
“They understand that without them, many families will lose their health coverage and be forced to make a decision no one should have to make, whether to go to the doctor for care or not,” Bennet, who is running to be Colorado governor in 2026, said. “This fight is critical for families all over our state. The Republicans need to come to the table, and (President) Donald Trump needs to come to the table and negotiate in good faith.”

The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. According to KFF, insurance providers have cited the expiration of the tax credits as a reason for premium increases. 
Members in the Senate failed to reach an agreement on a short-term government funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, before the end of the fiscal year, meaning many major federal government operations shut down starting Oct. 1. Other Democrats from Colorado in Congress also called on Republicans to negotiate on health care Wednesday. 










We need to extend these health care credits, and we need to reopen the government.


– U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet


Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Wednesday he and other GOP lawmakers are willing to talk with Democrats about the tax credits, but only after the government reopens. Colorado Republicans in the House including U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Windsor and U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton say the government is shut down because Democrats want to fund health care for people who are in the country without authorization, a notion U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat, rejected Wednesday.  
Back pay for federal workers
Extending the tax credits is an easy compromise, Bennet said, because some Republican senators have told him they don’t want to explain to their constituents why health insurance premiums are doubling or tripling. 
“There’s nothing that’s going to change between now and the end of the year except the American people’s lives are going to become much, much harder,” Bennet said. “Let’s settle this now and let’s settle this on a permanent basis, and then let’s give the American people the assurance that they need.”
Federal workers are legally entitled to back pay for their work during a government shutdown, Bennet said, and that is something that “shouldn’t even be up for negotiation.” Trump has said he wants to lay off federal workers and withhold their back pay, and Bennet said the president has shown he is willing to violate the law. 
Bennet’s office is still working to address constituent concerns with federal agencies that remain open.
“We need to extend these health care credits, and we need to reopen the government,” Bennet said. “We need to pay our troops. We need to keep our airports running. We need to get federal workers back on the job to process small business loans and housing applications.”

Rico, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/09/death-penalty-used-more-this-year/,"Thirty-four men have been executed in the U.S. this year. Eight other executions are scheduled by year's end, including one next Wednesday in Mississippi.","Thirty-four men have died by court-ordered executions in the U.S. so far this year, and eight others are scheduled to be put to death by year’s end, including five in the next eight days.
The total for 2025 already far exceeds the number of executions carried out last year — 25 — and could be the highest since 2012, when 43 inmates were put to death, though still far below the modern peak of 98 executions in 1999.
The increase in executions is largely being driven by four states — Florida, Texas, Alabama and South Carolina — that have carried out 76% of this year’s court-ordered killings.
“This is not an uptick of executions nationally — this is really down to just a few states,” said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.
Chief among them is Florida, which has already carried out 13 executions after performing just one last year. The increase comes as President Donald Trump has urged governors to expand their use of the death penalty.
“Gov. DeSantis is scheduling all of these executions with complete autonomy and in complete secrecy,” Maher said.
Ron DeSantis’ office has not responded to questions about why the governor is increasing the pace of executions now and whether Trump’s policies are playing a role.
Executions have been carried out this year in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
All but one of those states — Arizona — are run by Republican governors.
Here’s a look at the executions scheduled for the rest of the year, by state:
Indiana
Roy Lee Ward is set to die by lethal injection early Friday in the state’s third execution since resuming capital punishment last year.
Ward, 53, was convicted in the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne.
Attorneys said Ward is remorseful and has exhausted his legal options after many court battles.
Missouri
Lance C. Shockley is scheduled to be executed on Tuesday.
Shockley, 48, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl Dewayne Graham outside his home in Carter County in 2005.
Authorities said Graham was killed because he was investigating Shockley for involuntary manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident.
Florida
Samuel Lee Smithers is set to receive a lethal injection Tuesday evening.
Smithers, 72, was convicted of killing two women whose bodies were found in a rural pond in 1996. Authorities said he met his two victims — Christy Cowan and Denise Roach — on different dates at a Tampa motel to pay them for sex.
Norman Mearle Grim Jr., 65, is scheduled to be put to death on Oct. 28. He was convicted of raping and killing his neighbor Cynthia Campbell, whose body was found near the Pensacola Bay Bridge in 1998.
Smithers’ and Grim’s executions would be Florida’s 14th and 15th death sentences carried out in 2025, further extending the state’s record for executions in one year. Since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the state’s previous record was eight in 2014.
Mississippi
Charles Ray Crawford is scheduled to be executed Wednesday for kidnapping and killing a college student in 1993.
Crawford, 59, was sentenced to death for fatally stabbing 20-year-old community college student Kristy Ray after abducting her from her parents’ home in northern Mississippi’s Tippah County. Crawford told officers he had blacked out and did not recall killing her.
Texas
Robert Roberson had been scheduled to receive a lethal injection on Oct. 16, but his closely watched case was paused Thursday by Texas’ top criminal court.
Roberson, 58, had been set to become the first person in the U.S. put to death for a murder conviction tied to a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.
Prosecutors at Roberson’s 2003 trial argued that he hit his 2-year-old daughter Nikki Curtis and violently shook her, causing severe head trauma that led to her death.
But Roberson says he never abused the girl. A bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers believe Roberson is innocent and have sought to get him a new trial.
Roberson’s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died from complications related to pneumonia. They say his conviction was based on flawed and now outdated scientific evidence.
Arizona
Richard Kenneth Djerf is set to be executed Oct. 17 by lethal injection for killing four members of a family in their Phoenix home.
Djerf, 55, had pleaded guilty to four counts of murder in the 1993 killings of Albert Luna Sr., his wife Patricia, their 18-year-old daughter Rochelle and their 5-year-old son Damien.
Prosecutors say Djerf blamed another Luna family member for an earlier theft of home electronic items at his apartment and became obsessed with revenge.
Alabama
Anthony Todd Boyd is scheduled to be executed by nitrogen gas on Oct. 23.
A judge sentenced Boyd to death for his role in the 1993 killing of Gregory Huguley in Talladega. Prosecutors said Boyd taped Huguley’s feet together before another man doused him with gasoline and set him on fire over a $200 cocaine debt.
Boyd has long maintained his innocence, saying he never participated in the killing.
Tennessee
Harold Nichols is scheduled to be executed Dec. 11.
Nichols, 64, was convicted of rape and first-degree felony murder in the 1988 death of 21-year-old Karen Pulley in Hamilton County. Authorities said he broke into Pulley’s home, raped her and hit her in the head several times with a board.
Nichols had been scheduled to be killed in August 2020, but the execution was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/28173714/Death-penalty-protest-1.jpg,,,2025-10-09 16:57:35.642726

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Nearly seven in 10 U.S. adults in a national survey said President Donald Trump relied on executive power more than previous presidents, and a majority of individuals who reached that conclusion believe his use of federal authority wasn’t good for the country.
Overall, 69% of people who participated in the survey by Pew Research Center said Trump was depending more on executive authority than predecessors at the White House. Among respondents holding that position, 49% attached negative outcomes to Trump’s approach. Twelve percent said the president’s deployment of executive power was beneficial to the United States.
“There is a percentage of Republicans who aren’t so pleased with Trump’s actions,” said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka.
Beatty said Pew’s national snapshot of political sentiment didn’t separate out views of Kansans, but revealed a broad picture of disenchantment. He speculated the group of people uncomfortable with Trump’s flexing of executive power included voters who assisted with the election of Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids in Kansas’ 3rd Congressional District.
“The very ones that help Davids get elected in the 3rd District. The very ones the Kansas Republicans apparently want to redistrict,” Beatty said.
GOP leaders in the Kansas Legislature are seeking signatures of two-thirds of House and Senate members to call a special session in November to redraw the state’s four congressional district boundaries so it would be difficult for Davids to win in 2026. The GOP effort has been viewed by Davids as an attempt to disenfranchise voters, including Republicans in her district anchored by Johnson County.
Pew said 21% of 3,455 adults taking part in the Sept. 22-28 survey held the position Trump’s use of executive power in his second term was comparable with other presidents and 2% were convinced he was less reliant on that power than predecessors.
Eight of 10 Democrats told Pew that Trump pushed the power of the presidency beyond the level of recent presidents and the result was detrimental to the country. A mere 1% of Democrats said Trump’s use of presidential authority would improve the United States, Pew said.
Republicans in the survey were more divided as 49% said Trump was trying to exert more presidential power. A majority of these Republicans, however, said the outcome was useful to the nation. Pew said 24% of GOP-leaning individuals said the result would be bad for the country.
“What I’m seeing here is a flip,” said Michael Smith, professor of political science at Emporia State University. “In recent years, Republicans had been much more united than Democrats. This survey indicates that this has flipped.”
Pew described itself as a “nonpartisan fact tank” dedicated to informing the public about issues, attitudes and trends through polling, demographic research and content analysis. It is a subsidiary of the Pew Charitable Trust, which is the research center’s primary funder.
The new survey explored questions about whether Trump “definitely or probably” used his office improperly since taking office in January. Sixty-six percent said Trump had abused his power to “punish those who say things he does not like” and 62% were of the opinion he encouraged federal investigation of political opponents.
Sixty-four percent said the president definitely or probably didn’t set a high moral standard as president, Pew said. Sixty percent said Trump hadn’t improved the United States’ standing in the world. And, 59% said the president hadn’t improved the way government worked.
Pew said results showed Republicans and Democrats were more likely in 2025 than in 2019 to conclude Trump was striving to enrich himself, friends or family while serving as president. Here are comparison numbers: 89% of Democrats said Trump has enriched himself in 2025, up from 84% in 2019; and 31% of Republicans reached that conclusion in 2025, up from 23% in 2019.
In another section of the new survey, 51% of Americans said Trump relied to heavily too on issuance of executive orders. Twenty-seven percent were comfortable with the volume of executive orders signed by Trump, while 16% were unsure.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PC052596-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-09 16:57:35.642726

Bob Menendez and his wife Nadine at one of several dinners he and his friends treated the couple to during what prosecutors say was a wide-ranging bribery scheme that started in 2018. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York)A star government witness who admitted to bribing former U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez was sentenced to house arrest Thursday as recompense for aiding the prosecution and admitting guilt to federal charges.
A U.S. District Court judge in New York sentenced Jose Uribe, who was one of three businessmen indicted for his role in the bribery scheme, to six months of home detention with three years of supervision, to run concurrently. He will be subject to location monitoring and barred from obtaining new credit during that time.
He was also ordered to pay $866,947 in restitution and consented to pay a $292,000 money judgment stemming from his offenses. His attorney, Daniel Fetterman, did not immediately return a request for comment.
The sentencing comes more than two years after Menendez was first indicted for his role in the scheme.
Uribe pleaded guilty to seven counts of bribery, obstruction, wire fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy as part of an agreement to exchange his testimony for prosecutors’ recommendation of a lenient sentence.
Together, the charges he faced carried a maximum penalty of 95 years’ imprisonment.
Uribe admitted in court to purchasing through a proxy a Mercedes-Benz for Nadine Menendez, the senator’s wife, in exchange for Bob Menendez’s intervention in a growing criminal investigation against a friend and Uribe’s own insurance firm, which was operating illegally. Nadine Menendez was sentenced to 54 months in prison for her role in the bribery scheme last month.
Uribe’s testimony also helped secure convictions for Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, the other two businessmen charged over the bribery scheme. Hana was sentenced to eight years in prison, while Daibes received seven. The two were also fined more than $1 million.
Bob Menendez is currently serving an 11-year sentence.

For a lot of people, it’s an annual tradition.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Apple and peach picking season remains fruitful, despite drought.","How about them apples? Nick Cowles of Shelburne Orchards says, despite the drought, he’s been having a good season. Photo by Briana Brady/Shelburne News
This story by Briana Brady was first published in the Shelburne News on Oct. 9, 2025.
Even on a Thursday morning, if the sun is shining, Shelburne Orchards is busy. Kids run in and out of the trees. A group of teens hangs out at a table near the cider doughnut operation. Parents look over the wares at the store.
“Once the orchard is open for the season, it’s a public place,” owner Nick Cowles said.
Despite the drought, Shelburne Orchards is doing well. That’s partly because the orchard, which has 8,000 apple trees and seven varieties of peaches, is largely a pick-your-own operation. While the lack of rain might mean apples are dropping from the trees earlier than expected, it’s also given the orchard beautiful sunny weekend days when people are happy to spend their time wandering through the trees.

Cowles, a tall, friendly man in a white cowboy hat, took over the orchard from his father 50 years ago. For a while, he ran it just like his dad had. About 80% of the operation was picking and packing apples to sell to supermarkets and wholesalers. However, around 2000, something changed.
Around that time, Cowles took a trip out to Colorado. While he was there, he visited some orchards, connecting with one owner in particular who gave him a piece of advice that helped make Shelburne Orchards what it is today.
“He wanted to look on a map to see where my orchard was. And he’s like, ‘Oh my God, you’re right on the lake.’ And, ‘Oh, my god, Burlington. How big is Burlington?’ He said, you have the perfect place to have people come to you,” Cowles said.
So, Cowles switched things around. He started hosting a festival featuring local farmers — he’d ask everyone to bring a dish to sell made from the food they grew, and he hired musicians to come and play.
Even though now the festival has faded away, it helped launch Shelburne Orchards as a pick-your-own experience. Cowles still has musicians there every weekend day, including special programming for children on Sundays, offers tractor-pulled wagon rides into the orchard, and often brings in food trucks.
Now, retail sales, which include the store and pick-your-own, makes up 95% of the business, according to Cowles. The only store he sells to is the local market in Shelburne. The season is less about picking and packing, and more about bringing people in to enjoy the orchard and leave delighted by their bag of hand-picked apples and full of cider doughnuts.
For a lot of people, it’s an annual tradition.
“There’s an unusual amount of people who come here to buy doughnuts to send to their kids that just went to college,” he said.

Switching to a pick-your-own model also cleared out some space at the orchard — they no longer needed a packing room — so Cowles decided to start making brandy. Now, in a room behind a wrought iron gate worthy of a fairy tale with an apple at its center, Cowles keeps his distillery barrels. The oldest one, he said, is from 2009. He plans to open it when his grandson turns 21.
The brandy operation is one more way the orchard may be set up to ride through a drought. Unlike other products, apple brandy can be made with dropped apples — apples that fall from the tree before they’re picked, which happens more when there’s less rain.
“The trees are stressed now, and we’re more than halfway through harvest. At this point, apples are dropping early, so there’s a lot of apples on the ground, which is painful, because they can’t be used for cider,” Cowles said.
The distilling process, however, kills any bacteria.
In addition to concerns about droughts or floods, as the weather has trended warmer because of climate change, Cowles has also been planting peaches along with the apples. While when he began doing it 20 or so years ago, frost would kill about two out of every three crops, now, he gets a good harvest of cold-hardy peaches most years.
Now that he’s in his 70s, he said he’s moving toward a kind of retirement — he’s never going to actually retire, but he’s giving himself permission to focus on the parts he loves the most, like making the brandy. His daughter and her husband have come into the business, and he’s ready to let them carry the operation.
“This is such a beautiful place to be, and so much part of this business is the payoff of getting to be here and work,” he said.
He’s still going to make the brandy, still going to prune trees and put his hands to work doing carpentry projects. He’ll also likely still be setting up surprises in the orchard. In true Wonderland fashion, Cowles has created little scenes in parts of the orchard like his “apple room”, where people can enter through a door between two trees, and then follow the arrows until they reach a little table beneath an umbrella next to a standing fireplace.
Leaving the apple room on Sunday, three small children zoomed past Cowles into the orchard. Then, one stopped. He pointed up at Cowles and exclaimed, “I recognize you!” before he kept running.
More than fifty years in, if apples will still grow in Vermont, Shelburne Orchards will keep on picking.

In Boston’s South End early Sunday morning, a police cruiser responding to a large gathering was surrounded, struck with fireworks ""from all angles,"" and later set ablaze.","GOV. MAURA HEALEY on Wednesday issued a stern warning to participants in what she called “illegal street meetups,” pledging “zero tolerance” for the growing wave of coordinated drag racing and mass car rallies that erupted across Massachusetts over the weekend.
“Do not engage in that behavior,” Healey said during a press conference at the State House. “If you do it, we’re going to find you and we will hold you accountable to the furthest extent of the law.”
Healey said she has directed State Police Colonel Geoffrey Noble to ensure troopers “work directly with local chiefs and departments in combating this and holding perpetrators accountable.”
When pressed by a reporter on whether State Police weren’t already providing that support, Healey replied, “Oh gosh, of course, of course… no the State Police in all these instances, responded and continue to work closely with law enforcement. I just wanted people to know that I’ve specifically asked Colonel Noble to work operationally.” 
She declined to share details, because, “This is a law enforcement matter.”
The governor’s remarks followed a weekend that saw police responding to “street takeover” events in at least seven communities, according to the Boston Globe. In Boston’s South End early Sunday morning, a police cruiser responding to a large gathering was surrounded, struck with fireworks “from all angles,” and later set ablaze. Officers deployed Tasers and unholstered weapons to disperse the crowd, arresting two Rhode Island men.
Julian Bowers, 18, and William Cantwell, 19, were arraigned Monday in Roxbury District Court. Both face multiple charges including malicious destruction of property and assault and battery on a police officer. Cantwell, who also faces unrelated charges in Rhode Island, was held Monday on $1,000 cash bail; Bowers was held Monday on $500. Both were ordered to stay out of Boston except for court appearances.
In Randolph, more than 100 people swarmed police cruisers, setting off fireworks on their hoods. In Hyde Park, a spectator was injured by a car performing stunts. In Middleborough, an officer was nearly struck by a stolen Dodge Charger. In Fall River, police said an ambulance was blocked from reaching a call due to street racing crowds near the waterfront. Five people were arrested, and one suspect admitted learning about the gathering through an Instagram flyer, the Globe reported.
Healey tied the incidents to a broader pattern of online coordination and out-of-state participants.
“Whether you’re in Massachusetts or you think about coming to Massachusetts — you are not welcome to engage in that conduct at any time, in any place, anywhere in this state,” she said.
The response from Healey comes as she faces criticism from Republican challengers in the 2026 gubernatorial race, who are making public safety a centerpiece of their campaigns.
Republican candidate Brian Shortsleeve, one of three contenders in the GOP primary, seized on the weekend’s events to argue that Healey’s leadership has enabled a breakdown in law and order.
“Maura Healey once famously said, ‘America is burning, but that’s how forests grow,'” Shortsleeve said in a statement. “Thanks to that warped and permissive mindset, forests will soon be sprouting up all over Massachusetts because we are dealing with chaos in our streets.”
Shortsleeve accused Healey of “tying the hands of law enforcement” and prioritizing politics over safety. “This isn’t leadership, it’s lawlessness,” he said, vowing to “restore order, back our police, insist on bail reform… and make Massachusetts a place where people feel safe again.”
GOP gubernatorial candidate Mike Minogue said Healey should have anticipated the weekend’s events. 
“A fundamental responsibility of the Governor is to ensure safe and secure communities,” campaign spokesperson Erin Maguire said. “The Governor should have anticipated this violence based on the rioters own materials promoting a ‘Week of Rage’ and empowered the over 4,000 Boston police and State Troopers to do their job and keep these criminals locked up.” 
Republican challenger Mike Kennealy criticized the governor and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s “alarmingly high tolerance for violent crime, and respect for criminals.” 
“Their rhetoric and policies continue to embolden criminals while undermining law enforcement,” Kennealy said.
Healey rejected the notion that her administration is not doing enough and said Massachusetts is already taking aggressive steps. 
“We have zero tolerance for this in the state,” she said. “Not going to happen here. And if you do it, you’re going to be punished. I’m serious.”
Healey also pushed back against the idea of federal intervention after the reports of violence, as President Donald Trump has sent the National Guard into Democrat-led states in recent months. 
“He shouldn’t… He absolutely shouldn’t,” she said. “There’s simply no reason for any guard to come anywhere near Massachusetts.”
Calling Trump’s approach “political theater,” Healey said the state and local police are capable of managing the issue. “Crime happens. I’m talking about a particular trend that I’m seeing here. The important thing is we’re responding, we take action.”
The governor did not comment on whether she is coordinating with Attorney General Andrea Campbell on a legal response in the event of a National Guard deployment, saying only, “I’ll let the AG speak to that.”
Street takeovers — sometimes involving hundreds of people — are often planned through social media. Organizers use lookouts in high-visibility vests to block intersections, while drivers perform stunts like drifting and donuts.
Healey urged residents to assist authorities: “See something, say something. Call 911.” She cited the example of an ambulance in Fall River that was forced to reroute because streets were blocked, calling it a violation of public safety and basic quality of life.
“These kinds of car meetups and drag racing are counter to that,” Healey said. 
Her direct message to would-be participants: “No more. No more. You will be held accountable.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/68e69dc5533d3.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-09 16:57:35.642726

Nigel Edge of Oak Island was charged in a mass shooting that killed three people in Southport and injured others. The local district attorney said at Edge’s first court appearance that Edge has a traumatic brain injury and mental health issues, WECT reported. 
Improved access to mental health care will help communities feel safer and offer more help to people with serious mental health challenges, he said Thursday. 
“Here in North Carolina, we’ve recently suffered two prominent tragic reminders of just how important it is that we do everything in our power to get treatment to people who need it with serious mental illness,” Stein said at a press conference Thursday at mental health provider Integrated Family Services in Greenville. 
Most people with mental illnesses do not harm others, Stein said, but “we know that some can.”
Too many people have dangerous obsessions, exhibit threatening behaviors, and pose a risk to others, he said. 
The new law includes a provision requiring arresting officers to transport people to hospitals for mental health exams when those arrested are repeat offenders who have previously been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, NC Newsline has reported. 
Stein signed the crime bill last week, but criticized it for not funding new mental health treatment. 
“It’s important to get mental health treatment to people when they have their first interactions with law enforcement, provide mental health treatment to people who are incarcerated, and help people once they are released,” Stein said. 
Mobile crisis teams of mental health specialists should be expanded statewide, he said, and the state needs to tackle staffing shortages that prevent admitting more patients to psychiatric hospitals. 
State hospitals have enough staff for only 550 of the 900 hospital beds available, he said.
“Let’s make these jobs much better paid and more attractive so that we can ramp up the state’s capacity to meet the needs of our people,” Stein said. 
Stein also once again called on the legislature to increase funding for Medicaid. 
Medicaid is the largest payer of mental health treatment costs. But in North Carolina, the safety net program has cut payments to health care providers because, according to Stein, the legislature did not provide enough funding to make it through the year without reducing payment rates. 
The legislature considered bills to provide more Medicaid funding, but did not pass one.

(Photo courtesy of the Consortium for Cultivating Human And Naturally reGenerative Enterprises)A study conducted by agronomists at Iowa State University found that the slurry left over from turning farm waste into fuel could be a valuable soil amendment. 
The study, which analyzed 12 years of data on a commercial-sized farm, found that the byproduct of anaerobic digestion can restore soil organic carbon in active cropland and potentially reduce the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.
Fernando Miguez, an agronomy professor and co-author of the study, said the anaerobic digestion systems already work to manage manure and contribute to the production of renewable natural gas, but the study shows that these systems can also improve soil health on a farm.
“So there’s a lot of pluses, a lot of wins in this kind of system,” Miguez said.

The study was conducted at Sievers Family Farms, a beef cattle, corn and soybean operation near Stockton. Miguez said the Sieverses had been applying their digestate — the byproduct from their anaerobic digestion system — to their fields for a number of years when he learned of the practice.
“We were interested in what was going on with his soils,” Miguez said about the start of the research. “We know that it can be beneficial, but we wanted to see what was going on.” 
Digestate, which is the waste product of the anaerobic digestion of manure and corn stover, can be separated into solid and liquid forms, both of which were applied to Sievers’ fields. 

Anaerobic digestion is the process of bacteria breaking down organic material, like manure, corn stover or even food scraps without oxygen. This process creates a methane-rich gas that can be used for electricity, heat, vehicle fuel and more. According to Iowa State University, there are about 20 on-farm anaerobic digestion systems in Iowa. 

Applying manure to a field is not a new practice for farmers, but Miguez said the digestate, because it has been through anaerobic digestion, has more stable carbon in it compared to the liquid manure typically applied to a field, which means a greater percentage of carbon stays in the soil. 
According to the study, fields applied with digestate gained on average 714 pounds of carbon per acre per year. Over the time of the study, the fields had an average 9% increase in soil organic carbon. 
But fields with lower starting levels of soil organic carbon benefitted more from the addition of digestate. On average, the carbon in these fields increased 47% over the span of the study. 
The process of agriculture typically removes organic carbon from the soil. Practices like cover crops and reduced tillage try to retain soil organic carbon, but Lisa Schulte Moore, the director of ISU’s Bioeconomy Institute and co-author of the study, said it’s “very difficult” to build soil organic carbon while the land is in row-crop production. 
“It’s remarkable to see soil organic carbon increase that much over 12 years in a corn cropping system,” Schulte Moore said in a news release from ISU. 
Bryan Sievers, who owns the farm with his wife Lisa Sievers, said in the release that the study quantifies the in-the-field observations he has seen on his property. 
“It validates what we have long believed – that we’re seeing enhancements in the health of our soil which has translated into improved yields,” Sievers said. “Now we can start to assign a monetary value to these best management practices. And that’s what I’ve been seeking all my life in farming.”
Miguez said the measurements of soil carbon show the digestate is improving soil health over time, but the next step in the research is to see how the addition of digestate impacts yields and other soil nutrient metrics. 
Miguez said the research team has run nitrogen trials at the farm, but hasn’t yet analyzed the data to know how the digestate is impacting soil nitrogen levels. 
This data would be important because it could be a way for farmers to add nitrogen to their soils without the cost of synthetic fertilizers. Farmers like Sievers, who have an anaerobic digestion system on their farms, could also potentially market and sell the digestate to other farmers. 
Miguez said the research also indicated the digestate created increased levels of phosphorus in the soil, which Miguez said leads researchers to believe that digestate could be produced with different properties that could then be matched to the nutrient needs of a certain field. 
The study did not analyze the impact that digestate application has on water quality, though Miguez said it is something he would like to study. 
Anaerobic digestion is still a relatively new practice in Iowa, but many farmers are attracted to the technology’s ability to manage manure, and provide an additional revenue stream if the farmer is able to sell fuel generated by the breakdown of materials. 
“I hope people recognize that there’s a potential for: one addressing the management of manure … addressing the production of renewable natural gas … the potential to process food waste, and we can also show that we can improve soil health and reduce the reliance on synthetic nitrogen fertilizer,” Miguez said.

(Shepard Fosdyke-Jackson/U.S. Navy)Anchorage Mayor Suzanne LaFrance grew up outside the city during the Cold War. And the specter of nuclear conflict and an attack on the area’s military infrastructure loomed over her childhood.
“The Soviet Union felt pretty close,” she said. “I remember feeling a sense of fear, like: ‘We’re going to be the first ones in the line of fire. We’re this target.’”
The Cold War ended and the Soviet Union collapsed without an attack on Alaska. And for the next three decades, the state’s elected leaders grasped for arguments to justify continued federal investment in the major military installations in Anchorage and the Fairbanks area.
But now, amid twin, allied threats from Russia and an ascendant China, Alaska is again becoming a priority for U.S. military leadership. They see the state not just as a base from which to send out American forces to overseas conflicts, but also a place that could be the site of actual warfare.

The new focus on Alaska was underscored by the August summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin — as well as by visits to the state the same month by top military officials who came to observe large-scale drills, including one called Northern Edge.
The Northern Edge exercises take place every two years. But this year’s version was reimagined to simulate a conflict taking place specifically in Alaska — a change from prior iterations that had not contained as much of a geographic focus, officials said.
In the past, the exercises were “high-end training that occurred in Alaska,” said Rick Goodman, the U.S. Air Force brigadier general who directed this year’s edition of Northern Edge. “Now, this is high-end training that is occurring that is about Alaska, from Alaska.”

Goodmaan added: “The threats are growing.”
“Two critical regions”
The Northern Edge exercises have been taking place for decades. But this year, the military aligned with a second set of drills called Arctic Edge.
The two exercises brought together more than 5,000 troops to train not just in Anchorage but in rugged and remote sites across the state — from the Aleutian Island port of Dutch Harbor to the Bering Strait hub town of Nome to a high-altitude lake, where a naval unit practiced “diving scenarios.”

Among the top brass in Alaska to observe were Adm. Christopher Grady, who was then vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Adm. Samuel Paparo, the Navy’s top Indo-Pacific leader; and Adm. Kevin Lunday, who leads the U.S. Coast Guard.
What policymakers and experts describe as the military’s renewed focus on Alaska marks a sharp change from the immediate post-Cold War era.
In an interview, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski noted that two decades ago, the U.S. Department of Defense was threatening to close the major, Fairbanks-area Eielson Air Force Base — sending its 2,800 troops to Nevada, Louisiana and Georgia and placing the installation in “warm” storage.
Today, Eielson hosts two squadrons of cutting-edge F-35 fighter jets, with a recent federal investment of some $600 million in infrastructure supporting the planes. The military is also now exploring whether it could reopen a naval base on the remote Aleutian island of Adak, which was closed in 1997.

“We just kind of melted into the landscape, and everybody thinks about Alaska as remote and far away,” Murkowski said. “Now, things like the Chinese spy balloon a couple of years ago, things like the Trump-Putin visit — people were like, ‘Wow, I had no idea Alaska and Russia were so close. I had no idea of the geostrategic significance.’”
She added: “They don’t think about the fact that we bridge two pretty critical regions.”
The designs of the recent exercises show how the military is thinking about Alaska amid America’s growing tensions with China and Russia. And that thinking also ties into the state’s unique and tricky position in the military’s command structure.
Geographically, the protection of Alaska falls under the responsibility of U.S. Northern Command, or Northcom, a military unit headquartered in Colorado that’s charged with homeland defense.
But most of the specific forces stationed at Alaska bases — the fighter jets, the cargo planes and the thousands of soldiers — technically report to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, or Indopacom, a Hawaii-based unit expected to play a key role in any conflict with China.
The overlapping commands have long fueled concern among defense experts about competing priorities: How will the military manage to maintain and defend Alaska’s essential infrastructure if, for example, many of the jets and other assets based in the state are ordered to report to a Pacific conflict by Hawaii-based leaders?

This year’s drills were geared toward that exact type of scenario, as they brought together forces under both the Indopacom and Northcom umbrellas, according to Goodman, the general running Northern Edge.
The military, he said, needs to make sure “there is no such thing as a seam between Northcom and Indopacom — in a realistic scenario, that we’re able to both defend the homeland in this key geographic location in Alaska, in the Arctic, as well as project power.”
Alaska as “next-best alternative”
One element of the Arctic Edge drills hinted at the potential for a conflict in the Pacific to involve not just Anchorage- or Fairbanks-based resources dispatched to a far-off location, but for fighting to actually transpire within the state’s borders.
As part of the exercise, members of multiple military branches simulated the quick construction of a backup port near Anchorage — working from the assumption that Anchorage’s main port, which handles both military and civilian cargo, was unavailable.
The scenario didn’t specifically envision why the port was unusable, officials said.

But it’s clear that Alaska’s military infrastructure would hold strategic significance in a Pacific conflict in a way that would likely make it a target for China, according to David Ochmanek, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense who’s now a senior researcher at the RAND think tank.
In the event of a conflict over the contested island of Taiwan or elsewhere in the Pacific, the state’s bases are effectively part of America’s second line of attack against China, Ochmanek said. That’s because closer U.S. bases in Japan and Guam would likely be overwhelmed by China’s initial attacks — leaving the Alaska bases, and installations in Hawaii, as the likely origin of surviving bombers and jets that could hit Chinese assets.
While China’s current capacity to reach Alaska with missiles is not well understood, it’s fairly clear that China’s military is increasingly interested in finding ways to put Alaska’s bases at risk — and that they’re capable of achieving that over time, Ochmanek added.
“It would be a mistake to assume that those bases will be in sanctuary for the indefinite future,” Ochmanek said. “The Chinese are going to make darn sure that we can’t make effective use of those closer-in bases. But they understand that we’re posturing Alaska and Hawaii as the next-best alternative to generate bomber missions. And they’re increasingly interested in finding ways to suppress that.”
Murkowski, the U.S. senator, said she prefers to see her home state not as a potential target but as a region that’s well-defended, thanks to the presence of so many fighter jets and troops.
Alaskans can regularly witness those jets conducting practice maneuvers above Anchorage and Fairbanks. But Murkowski said that Alaskans who live and work outside the state’s military bases can miss the huge numbers of people and complex choreography that goes into large-scale troop and aircraft movements and exercises.
“Most people have no idea that it’s happening,” she said.
Murkowski got a close look at that capacity when she flew out from Anchorage’s Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier during the Northern Edge drills.

Murkowski donned a helmet, life preserver and goggles to fly, she said, 200 miles across the Gulf of Alaska in a twin-rotored Osprey aircraft — peering out over an open ramp that looked onto the “wide ocean.” She was greeted on deck by an honor guard, then watched as Navy personnel coordinated the takeoff of a dozen fighter jets, communicating solely through hand signals because of the roar of the engines.
“In Anchorage and around Fairbanks, we get used to seeing the jets when there’s exercises. You hear them overhead. But you have no appreciation of what you’re seeing,” she said. “The heat and the fire and the noise and just everything that resonates from the power of those jets taking off is nothing short of incredible.”

Vickkburg National Military Park is an exception.,"Most of Mississippi’s national parks and monuments are closed to visitors because of the federal government shutdown.
An exception is the Vicksburg National Military Park, which initially closed when the shutdown began Oct. 1 but entered an agreement to reopen the next day with donations from the nonprofit Friends of Vicksburg National Military Park. 
While the visitor center, USS Cairo Gunboat & Museum, tour roads and restrooms are all open to visitors, the park is running on limited staff.
Operating the park during the shutdown costs $2,000 a day, said Bess Averett, executive director of Friends of Vicksburg National Military Park.
“We are not a massive nonprofit, so we do have limited resources,” Averett said. “So far, the public has been very generous.”
Keeping the park closed would make it vulnerable to vandalism, relic hunting and more problems, she said. It also would mean turning away visitors, hurting the local economy.

The military park is the most visited attraction in Mississippi, according to the local tourism office, Visit Vicksburg.
The federal government shut down after Congress failed to pass a budget for the new federal fiscal year. During a shutdown, essential services continue, including air traffic control and emergency response, but many federal employees are furloughed.
Mississippi Today reached out to most of the national park sites in Mississippi and went to the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home in Jackson to check if they were open. The calls went to voicemail, the emails either bounced back or went unanswered by the time of publication, and the Evers Home was empty.  
The Emmett Till Interpretive Center and the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument, both in Sumner, are closed. 
Visitors can still access the islands on Gulf Islands National Seashore in Ocean Springs, the Sun Herald reported. However, the Davis Bayou Area appeared to be closed. 
All of Mississippi’s barrier islands are “pretty much shut down,” said Ronnie Wentzell, who works for the privately run Ship Island Excursions.
“When I say it’s shut down, it’s only the fact that there’s no security people, there’s no park rangers on none of the islands or going to the islands,” Wentzell said.
The ferry service is still taking people to Ship Island. However, Fort Massachusetts is closed and there are no public accommodations. 
Kim Foster, a spokesperson for Natchez Trace Compact, wrote in an email, “I am happy to report that the Natchez Trace Parkway and many (not all) of its sites remain open during the shutdown.”

The parkway is open for travel, with a closure that is unrelated to the shutdown, between milepost 181 and milepost 204, roughly French Camp to Mathiston. Most sections of it are open, but some historic sites and trails are closed “for restoration or maintenance.”
Mississippi Today emailed the National Park Service press office, which responded with a statement that national parks would be “as accessible as possible” during the shutdown.
“Critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response,” the statement said.
The National Park Service is keeping most national parks partially open during the shutdown. However, more than two-thirds of its employees are furloughed. 
The National Parks Conservation Association is calling on Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to close all national parks, arguing that keeping them open is a danger to visitors and the parks themselves.
According to the National Park Service contingency plan, limited staff will remain to perform “exempted activities,” such as law enforcement and fire suppression.

Trails, park roads, lookouts and open-air memorials “will generally remain accessible to visitors.” However, there will be no updates on road or trail conditions. Websites and social media will only be updated for emergencies. Parks that collect fees under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act can use those fees to provide basic visitor services.
Parks that don’t have accessible areas won’t operate and will have minimal staff.
“As part of their orderly shutdown activities, park staff will post signs notifying visitors that only basic or no visitor services, maintenance, or other management activities will be conducted, and emergency services will be limited,” the plan read.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/07022258/military-park.jpg,,,2025-10-09 15:58:36.889984

(Photo: Getty Images)Editors note: This story mentions suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.
Ava Smithing remembers vividly her first interaction with social media. She was 12 years old when she downloaded Pinterest to look at recipes and style videos. But because the app knew Smithing was a young girl, they started to show her bikini advertisements.
“I started to look at these bikini advertisements for longer than other things that I would be shown. They made me feel anxious, because I didn’t look like the women in those photos,” Smithing shared Wednesday with the North Carolina Child Fatality Task Force Intentional Death Prevention Committee.

When Smithing hovered over a post too long, the app’s algorithm made decisions about what to show her more of. A process called collaborative filtering compared what Ava viewed with what other users were viewing. Soon the app was serving up the pre-teen a steady stream of content on extreme exercising, dieting and eating disorders.
“All of a sudden, this really intense eating disorder content became the only thing that I was seeing online,” Smithing said. She worked with her therapist to report the ads that made her uncomfortable, yet the content in her online feed largely remained the same.
Smithing, now 24, said what’s problematic is when social media platforms collect data to show impressionable users things that they do not want to see for an extended period of time.
“You have young people who have this happen to them with hate speech or political conspiracy theories. Or in the case of this task force, you have young people who have this happen with self-harm. Eventually the algorithms lead them to a rabbit hole of only seeing suicide content,” she warned.
That prospect is especially worrisome for this committee. The number of child suicide deaths has increased by 23% over the past 10 years, according to the state Division of Public Health.
A study published in JAMA this summer from Columbia and Cornell University researchers found that youth with high or increasingly addictive use patterns on social media and mobile phones had a two to three times greater risk of suicidal behaviors and ideation, and worse mental health.
Smithing and the Young People’s Alliance are encouraging legislators to pass Senate Bill 514, the Social Media Control in IT Act. The bill would combat social media addiction by requiring social media platforms to respect the privacy of user’s data and prohibit minors’ data from being used for algorithmic purposes.
The legislation has not moved since April. But the Alliance is hopeful that an endorsement from the North Carolina Child Fatality Task Force could push the bill over the finish line in 2026.
On Wednesday, Rep. Donna White (R-Johnston) and Sen. Sydney Batch (D-Wake) pledged to work together and urge their colleagues to pass SB 514 in the short session.
But even as they agreed to try to rein in social media algorithms, they learned of a new threat on the horizon: chatbots.

A majority of teens use text-based chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini for homework help. But increasingly teens are turning to this technology for emotional support.
Associate Professor Celeste Campos-Castillo works in the Department of Media & Information at Michigan State University.
Campos-Castillo believes there is nothing wrong with artificial intelligence or AI encouraging a student to work on an assignment. But the technology can become problematic as chatbots are developed to have more human-like characteristics.
“These chatbots present an image and a conversational style meant to give the chatbot a personality. The personalities could be fictional characters from TV or movies or celebrities, or characters custom built by the user,” she explained.
“Together, these text-based and character-based chatbots are sometimes referred to as AI companions,” Campos-Castillo told the panel. “They make people feel like they’re talking to an assistant, a friend, romantic partner – or in other words, like they’re talking to a companion.”
Campos-Castillo pointed to three documented cases over the past two years in which chatbots were linked to death by suicide among adolescents.
Sixteen-year-old Adam Raine ended his life on April 11, 2025. His parents later discovered that their son had extended conversations with ChatGPT about his suicidal thoughts. Matthew and Maria Raine have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI.
Matthew Raine testified at a congressional hearing in September that ChatGPT went so far as to offer to write the suicide note.

The technology had no morality built into the code, Raine told a Senate committee.
Campos-Castillo said for teens going through a period where friendships are changing, it can be quite appealing to talk to a chatbot about their problems.”The popular chatbots are designed to always agree with you, and if the chatbot makes people feel like they’re always right, then people are going to be much more likely to return to it,” she said.
But, she added, they don’t want chatbots or AI companions to reinforce feelings of loneliness that lead to withdrawal from other humans.“[It] can turn harmful if a person tells a chatbot that their friends don’t get them, their parents don’t get them, that they feel alone in the world.”
Smithing says the Young People’s Alliance believes more policy work is urgently needed to provide guardrails around this emerging technology.
“We believe that their ability to harm stems from their ability to form codependent relationships. The harm can come from how they are using the relationship that they developed with the minor to manipulate that minor, to tell them that what they’re doing is the right thing,” said Smithing.
The Young People’s Alliance is also increasingly concerned about the prevalence of AI therapists.
Smithing said AI therapists do not have to comply with patient privacy and data protection laws. “They can share the information that children share with them in these therapy sessions with data brokers and advertisers out the wazoo.”
She suggested it’s not hard to imagine a scenario in which a young person tells a generative AI therapist they feel insecure because their acne is flaring up, or that they feel ugly. Then their social media feed is flooded with dozens of advertisements for skincare products.
“It’s going to point out that I have insecurities. That’s going to make it worse.”
For some members of the legislative committee, it was their first time hearing about the rapidly emerging technology.
Senate Bill 624 could be a first step in addressing the licensing, safety, and privacy of AI Chatbots in North Carolina. The bill was introduced in March but promptly bottled up in the Senate Rules Committee.
Smithing hoped it wouldn’t stay bottled up much longer.
“When I go to my therapist, I tell my deepest, darkest secrets and I’m so grateful that HIPAA exists and that my therapist is not allowed to share that information with anyone else,” said Smithing.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2193072141-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-09 15:58:36.889984

The testimony, which was delivered during the fourth day of Diamantis’ ongoing criminal trial, was meant to button up federal prosecutors’ claims that Diamantis solicited bribes from contractors in return for steering millions of dollars in work on local school projects to those firms. 
The prosecution’s three witnesses on Thursday testified in rapid fashion, and all of the testimony focused on a singular theme: Diamantis instructing local officials to hire specific firms.
The jurors first heard Walter Willett, Tolland’s school superintendent, describe how Diamantis told Tolland officials to hire Construction Advocacy Professionals to oversee construction on the Birch Grove Elementary project.
Then came Melvyn Colon, the chairman of Hartford’s School Building Committee, who explained to jurors how Diamantis instructed the city to hire Construction Advocacy Professionals to help with the Bulkeley High School Project.
And finally, the jurors heard Jack Butkus, a project manager with ARCADIS, who said Diamantis threatened to withhold state money from the Weaver High School project in Hartford unless the city re-hired Acranom Masonry for a $3 million contract.
All three witnesses said they did not feel like they could challenge Diamantis’ hiring preferences because of the immense control he had over state funding for schools. 
“I didn’t feel like I had any practical choice,” Willett told prosecutors. 
“We were between a rock and a hard place,” Butkus added. 
And Colon emphasized that Diamantis had a “forceful and prickly personality.”
Two executives with Acranom and Construction Advocacy Professionals told the jury earlier this week that they provided Diamantis with bribes, in the form of cash, checks and a job for his daughter.
But the testimony from Willett, Colon and Butkus was meant to show what the two contractors got in return. 
Diamantis’ defense attorney, Norm Pattis, used his cross examination of the witnesses to raise doubts about whether Diamantis was acting corruptly and to suggest that he was simply doing his job. 
On the Birch Grove Elementary project, Pattis argued that Diamantis hand-picked contractors for that project because he needed to act quickly to rebuild the crumbling foundation in that school.
And in Hartford, Pattis argued that Diamantis wanted Construction Advocacy Professionals selected for the Bulkeley project because it was a woman-owned business. 
“There’s nothing wrong with hiring a woman, is there?” Pattis asked at one point. 
Justifications
Colon told the jury that Diamantis discussed hiring Construction Advocacy Professionals on the Bulkeley High School project before Hartford ever solicited bids for that job.
And he said that Construction Advocacy Professionals was eventually picked for that role even though other companies offered to do the work for less money.
The federal prosecutors also showed the jury an email in which Colon told other Hartford officials that Diamantis was “willing to pay extra to get his person on board.” Colon confirmed that “person” was Antonietta DiBenedetto Roy, the owner of Construction Advocacy Professionals. 
During that testimony, Diamantis leaned forward in his seat to view the email on a computer monitor in front of him. 
When the Hartford school building committee eventually hired Construction Advocacy Professionals in 2019, Colon said, they tried to justify their decision by pointing out the company’s status as a woman-owned business.
But he said the company was actually selected solely because of Diamantis.
During cross examination, Pattis tried to pick apart Colon’s testimony, but the defense attorney didn’t always get the answers that he was looking for. 
At one point, Pattis asked if it was normal for the Hartford school building committee to lie about why they were hiring a specific company. 
Colon said it was not normal, and that he lied in the case of CAP because Diamantis’ demand to hire the company was not a legitimate reason to pass over other qualified businesses.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1006_SR_KostaTrialDay1_141-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-09 15:58:36.889984

The funds include $4.5 million for five agencies that provide cold weather shelters and $3.5 million to 11 nonprofits to staff drop-in centers across the state. The funds fall short of a $9 million goal that had been put forward, but advocates said they are still working to recoup the additional $1 million during an anticipated special legislative session.
Matthew Morgan, executive director of the Hartford-area nonprofit Journey Home, thanked Gov. Ned Lamont and the legislature for the funds, which he said are “literally life saving investments that allow us to care for our most vulnerable. That demonstrates that Connecticut is investing in the values that we as a state represent.” 
But Morgan added that there are still worrisome challenges in the months ahead. 
“While I believe that this investment will avoid a mass loss of human life, we are still extremely concerned that we saw a 45% … increase in unsheltered homelessness over the past year and are worried that we may not be able to offer shelter to everyone who needs it this winter without additional investment in shelter and housing resources,” Morgan said.
Sarah Fox, the CEO of the CT Coalition to End Homelessness, was also measured in her remarks.
“We are gravely concerned about impending federal cuts and what we are going to see in the future,” Fox said. “But I also know that together we can have impact. Together, we can save lives.”
The event came as Connecticut lawmakers are trying to revive an ambitious housing bill that Lamont vetoed earlier this year. The bill aimed to improve the affordability and accessibility of housing and tackled issues like zoning, transit-oriented development, parking, homelessness and fair rent commissions. Lamont referenced that bill on Thursday.
“We had a bill in the legislature last year. I’d love to see if we could bring it back and get it passed,” he said. Regarding the $8 million for emergency shelters, Lamont said: “Look, this is a down payment on what we got to do to make sure that in this cold weather, we can provide a little bit of extra support.” 
Speaking from a West Hartford warehouse for gently used furniture that has been donated to people moving into new homes, Lamont also encouraged people to donate used furniture to Journey Home.

“Help people get started. It’s a show of respect and dignity to help them get going.” 
Speaking after the press conference, Fox said the additional $1 million will help address the uptick in unsheltered homelessness across the state. Asked if she was hopeful the funding would come through, Fox said no.
“But I appreciate where the state’s at, and I think we can work together to get where we need to go.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5192-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-09 16:57:35.642726

The award, known as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation’s “genius grant,” recognizes people who have “demonstrated extraordinary creativity, significant accomplishments and potential for future breakthroughs in their fields.”
McLellan has been hailed for his work on viral proteins that has transformed vaccine development and helped protect the health of millions of people around the globe.
That research also earned him the McArthur Fellowship this year, said Laurie Lauzon Clabo, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs at Wayne State, in a statement.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Dr. McLellan’s work exemplifies the impact of scientific innovation and the tremendous, life-saving impact of research,” Clabo said. “We are proud but not at all surprised to have a Wayne State graduate recognized with one of the world’s most prestigious honors.”
McLellan earned a bachelor’s degree in chemistry with an emphasis in biochemistry from Wayne State in 2003.
McLellan’s past research has focused on engineering viral proteins, which helped lay the foundation for modern COVID and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccines. His current work is helping to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine, which also is exploring how structure-based vaccine designs can be used for non-viral bacterial infections.

Additionally, McLellan’s post-doctoral work helped design a protein that became a basis for the first successful RSV vaccine. The same structure-base approach, Wayne State said in a news release, has been applied to studying the common cold coronavirus and the dangerous Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS.
During the 2020 COVID pandemic, which saw the novel virus rise to infect hundreds of millions around the world, McLellan’s lab was able to swiftly develop stabilized versions of the virus’ spike protein, a critical component of all future COVID vaccines.
McLellan was inducted to the National Inventors Hall of Fame earlier this year after receiving other prestigious awards for his work since 2020.

Andy Beshear is joining Democratic state officials in a legal action against President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in U.S. cities and calling on Republican governors to also speak out against what Beshear called “political stunts.”

“I wish I could say it’s silly, but it’s scary and it’s dangerous,” Beshear said Thursday. “You don’t just get to order the National Guard into some place because you think the crime is too high or to pick a fight with a blue mayor or a blue governor.
“This is something that no other president has ever done. And there’s a reason. It’s unlawful and it’s wrong. And I’m going to do everything I can to stand up to it.”
Beshear is part of a coalition of Democratic governors and attorneys general from 23 states and the District of Columbia who on Wednesday filed an amicus brief supporting Oregon’s court challenge to Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in Portland.
Beshear also said he’s disappointed in the bipartisan National Governors Association for its official silence on Trump’s deployment of troops into places where the governors and mayors don’t want them. “If this organization is meant to stand up for governors, it needs to,” Beshear said Thursday during his regular media briefing.
Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and JB Pritzker of Illinois earlier this week threatened to leave the National Governors Association unless it takes a stand against what Newsom called an “unprecedented assault” on states’ rights.
Beshear also said he is “really disappointed in my fellow Republican governors that know how wrong this is. … It is un-American and every governor should be standing up against it.”
Beshear, who will be said the Trump administration is falsely claiming troops are needed to quell insurrections and that National Guard members are endangered when they are ordered into situations for which they are not trained. 
“It’s one of the hallmarks of our country that we don’t have military running around on our streets. You don’t get off an airplane and see military standing there with a machine gun. This is not who we are. We don’t militarize our communities. It’s one of the tenets of our very founding.”
Over the summer, Trump ordered National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. A federal judge in September ruled that deployment violated a federal law against military members conducting domestic law enforcement.
Since then, Trump has also sent National Guard troops to Chicago, Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon, in what he says is an effort to combat crime. However, elected officials in Illinois and Oregon have argued against this move and have filed legal challenges over it. Tennessee’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee has welcomed the deployment.

In addition to financial aid the funding also will cover more in-depth training for students considering an in-demand career in the healthcare industry.
USC Beaufort plans to use the Health Resources and Services Administration grant-funded stipends to recruit students to its nursing program who could go on to work in hospitals, urgent care clinics and nursing homes in the Bluffton and Beaufort communities, popular with retirees.
The grant will aid 64 students annually for four years.
The school, in a statement, said the grant will also help students land jobs upon graduation, with a focus on placing students in underserved and rural areas.
“With this significant grant, USCB is well-positioned to help meet South Carolina’s future nursing needs,” said Professor Lynne Hutchison, director of the project. “We are taking a multi-pronged approach to recruit diverse nursing students, train and retain them to graduation, and promote their entry into the healthcare workforce.”
SC spending $30M to tackle nursing shortage predicted to be nation’s 7th worst

The Palmetto State is forecast to have the seventh-largest shortage of registered nurses in the nation by 2036 — with a predicted 13,600 vacancies, leaving more than 1 in 5 positions unfilled — according to a federal Health Resources and Services Administration report.
The challenge is compounded by an aging population. The South Carolina Institute of Medicine and Public Health predicts that by 2030 more than 1 million of the state’s residents will be aged 65 or older.
USC Beaufort Provost Kim Dudas said the school is adding courses specifically to train students on how to care for the area’s aging population.
“This grant is a significant victory for the Lowcountry and for the future of our nursing workforce,” said Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. “South Carolina faces a growing shortage of nurses, and this grant provides the resources, training, and long-term support needed to keep more nurses on the frontlines of care.”
Mace, who represents South Carolina’s coastal 1st Congressional District supported the grant application by USC Beaufort, which she said boasts a 100% NCLEX-RN pass rate.
Just this fall, USC Beaufort nearly doubled the size of its nursing program through a new partnership with Beaufort Memorial Hospital.
Starting in 2022, the school, along with Beaufort County and the city of Beaufort, chipped in to build a $2.8 million training center for students and hospital employees.
The center, which includes two large classrooms and four clinical simulation labs designed to replicate hospital rooms, was funded through local dollars, as well as state and federal funding passed down to each of the partners. Artificial intelligence-powered manikins simulate patients for students to train on. They blink, cough and answer questions about symptoms. Students can draw the manikins’ blood, check breathing and chest issues, check for abnormal pupils and practice guiding the manikin “patients” through labor and delivery.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
A retired children’s court judge and member of a task force re-vamping the state Children’s Code warned a legislative committee Thursday that increased criminal penalties for young people won’t work. 
John Romero Jr.’s lecture was among six presentations Thursday regarding juvenile justice before members of the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee. The committee is one of several legislative committees mulling ways to address juvenile crime in New Mexico at the 30-day legislative session beginning in January
Recent, high-profile crimes allegedly involving young people contributed to a renewed push for legislative action, including harsher penalties. Republican lawmakers, for example, sought to lower the age of adult criminal responsibility from 15 to 14 for certain crimes during the special legislative session earlier this month. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also chastised the majority-Democrat Legislature in March, at the conclusion of the 60-day legislative session, for failing to take up juvenile crime bills, in particular. 
But Romero told the committee to look more closely at evidence showing that longer criminal sentences are less effective in deterring crime than swift, certain justice. And he said lawmakers seeking to reduce crime would miss the bigger picture if they focused solely on young people. 
New Mexico Legislature March 22: A somber conclusion

In fact, he noted a 2024 Legislative Finance Committee report found the biggest demographic involved in violent crime is men aged 24 to 42. 
“I don’t see a lot in the media about that and the clamor to change the criminal justice code — not the delinquency code — and deal with those violent offenses in a different way,” he said.
The LFC report looked only at Bernalillo County, which it argued was the driver of statewide crime, and found an increase of 38%  in juvenile crime cases between 2023 and 2024. Of those cases, 34% were cases involving juveniles with firearms.
Still, it notes that, even with the increase, adult men aged 24 to 42 commit “the majority” of violent crimes. 
After serving as a Child Court judge, Romero served on the Children’s Code Task Force that released a report in June 2024, along with an addendum in January. The report issued an array of findings about juvenile justice, including for police, prosecutors, judges, lawmakers and the state child welfare agency. 
Based on those findings and a renewed legislative push, Romero criticized news media for what he said was a repeat of the “superpredator” phase in the 1990s, where young people, particularly young Black men, accused of crimes were derided as “radically impulsive” and “brutally remorseless,” he said.

Alme, a former U.S. Attorney for Montana during President Donald Trump’s first administration, was confirmed in a 51-47 vote. Democrats and Republicans have fought for more than a decade about confirmation votes and the filibuster barrier of a 60-vote threshold to approve presidential appointments.
Democrats blocked many of President Donald Trump’s appointments, but Republicans changed the rules in the Senate this fall to speed up the nomination process. Both parties have mounted similar rule changes to push through nominations during the last 10 years, the AP reported.
Trump took to social media this summer to criticize Senator Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is the Senate Judiciary chairman and oversees that process. Grassley has been on the committee since 1981.
Trump took aim at a so called “blue slip” process, which allows home-state senators to approve or block some nominees.
In late September, Republicans in the U.S. Senate moved to confirm 48 positions. Earlier this week, they moved through 107 more, which included Alme.
“For nine months, Senate Democrats engaged in historic obstruction of law enforcement, placing an unprecedented hold on all 93 U.S. Attorney nominees,” Grassley said in a statement. “Even as our nation reeled from horrific mass shootings, attacks on federal facilities and a devastating political assassination, Democrats have continued to deny American communities their top federal law enforcement officials.”
Alme is the former head of the Montana Department of Revenue and was also in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Montana between 2003 and 2010. A Great Falls native, Alme grew up in Dillon, Victor and Helena, graduating from Miles City. He holds degrees from the University of Colorado and Harvard University.
His appointment received heavy praise across the state.
“Kurt has already done an incredible job in his interim capacity and we are thrilled to see his final confirmation by the U.S. Senate,” Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy said in a joint press release. “Kurt will crack down on drug trafficking and crime, protect our indigenous communities, and uphold the rule of law, and we look forward to seeing the continued impact that he will have on our great state.”
The Montana County Attorneys Association and the Montana Sheriff’s and Peace Officers Association both praised the appointment. Several organizations and people — including the Montana Nonprofit Association, Director of Montana Department of Corrections Brian Gootkin and former Missoula County Attorney Kirsten Pabst — sent letters in support of Alme to Daines and Sheehy.
His appointment received bipartisan support as well. Rep. Shelly Fyant, an Arlee Democrat who used to lead the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribal Council.
“I saw the work the U.S. Attorney’s Office did focusing on reducing methamphetamine and opioid related overdoses and violent crimes, which not only plague the Flathead Indian Reservation, but reservations throughout Montana and the Nation,” Fyant wrote in a letter to Daines and Sheehy. “Mr. Alme’s hands-on approach was greatly appreciated as he frequently visited Montana reservations and met directly with Tribal leaders about specific drug abuse and trafficking, public safety and Missing & Murdered Indigenous Persons (MMIP) issues.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/kurt_alme_7714_high_res_0.jpg,,,2025-10-09 14:58:22.815437

The project — the largest single manufacturing investment in AstraZeneca’s history — will include one facility focused on drug production for chronic diseases and another dedicated to antibody-drug conjugates, a key component of cancer treatment. An estimated 3,000 additional indirect jobs are expected to result from the investment.
The British biopharmaceutical giant said the Virginia sites will produce small molecules, peptides and oligonucleotides used in its weight management and metabolic portfolios, including oral GLP-1, baxdrostat and oral PCSK9 products. The second facility will manufacture antibody-drug conjugates for AstraZeneca’s oncology pipeline.
“With our $4.5 billion investment in Virginia, we are not only building a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, but also driving life sciences innovation and economic growth,” said AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot in a statement. 
“This new facility will create thousands of jobs and strengthen America’s national security and health sovereignty. We have found in Virginia an amazing team that moves at incredible speed to build a better future for this commonwealth and the American people.”
The company will build its new facilities at the Rivanna Futures Site in northern Albemarle County, which previously received a $9.7 million grant from the Virginia Business Ready Sites Program to prepare infrastructure for large-scale employers. AstraZeneca said it chose Virginia for its strong talent pool, proximity to research universities and “pro-business environment.”
Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who announced the deal Thursday, called the investment a milestone for Virginia’s growing life sciences sector.
“AstraZeneca’s $4.5 billion investment is the largest single manufacturing investment in the company’s history and a game-changer for American drug manufacturing,” Youngkin said. “It took just 33 days from our first conversation to partnering on this project — that’s moving at Virginia speed.”
Youngkin credited the Virginia Talent Accelerator Program and the Virginia Business Ready Sites Program for helping the state secure the deal. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership worked alongside Albemarle County and the General Assembly’s Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission to bring the project to fruition.
To support the investment, AstraZeneca will be eligible for a special appropriation of up to $191.3 million, contingent on state legislative approval, tied to the creation of 500 jobs at its chronic disease facility. A second grant from the commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund will support the cancer-therapy facility.
Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura said the deal highlights Virginia’s competitive advantages in biotech and advanced manufacturing.
“AstraZeneca has never shied away from the hardest challenges: cancer, obesity, heart disease, and more,” Segura said. “Their $4.5 billion investment in Virginia is a powerful vote of confidence in what our Commonwealth has to offer.”
Local officials hailed the project as a big win for Albemarle County.
“AstraZeneca brings transformative investment to Albemarle County, creating high-quality jobs with competitive wages for our local workforce,” Board of Supervisors Chair Jim Andrews said. 
The investment is also drawing bipartisan praise from state and federal lawmakers representing the region.
 “I am excited to welcome AstraZeneca to Albemarle County and Virginia’s Fifth District,” said U.S. Rep. John McGuire, R-Goochland. “This investment will create 600 new high-paying jobs that focus on chronic disease care and prevention, which makes a positive impact both economically and in Americans’ health.”
State Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, called the investment “life-changing” for the region and a model of how state and local partnerships can drive growth. 
Del. Amy Laufer, D-Albemarle, said the project’s proximity to the University of Virginia and Piedmont Virginia Community College will open opportunities for research collaboration and workforce training.
AstraZeneca currently employs more than 18,000 people in the United States across 19 research, manufacturing and commercial sites. In 2024, the company contributed $5 billion directly to the U.S. economy and supported an estimated $20 billion in total economic impact.
The company’s Virginia operations will be supported by the Virginia Talent Accelerator Program, a workforce training initiative ranked No. 1 nationally by Business Facilities and Area Development magazines. 
All training services will be offered at no cost to AstraZeneca, aligning with international best practices to develop a skilled biopharmaceutical workforce.
Once operational, the Albemarle facilities are expected to play a central role in AstraZeneca’s plan to invest $50 billion across the United States by 2030 — a strategy aimed at strengthening domestic manufacturing and advancing research in chronic and rare diseases.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle) The Indiana Supreme Court dismissed the latest disciplinary case against Attorney General Todd Rokita, closing the matter after he and state disciplinary officials agreed he “really meant it” when he accepted responsibility for professional misconduct nearly two years ago.
In a published order issued Thursday, the high court justices granted a joint request from Rokita and the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission to dismiss the case as moot, saying the two sides had resolved their dispute.
Included in the agreement was a joint statement, in which Rokita “reaffirms what he attested to” in a 2023 affidavit accepting responsibility for violating professional conduct rules — which he confirmed that he signed voluntarily. 
The statement also aimed to “clarify any real or perceived confusion” stemming from the Republican attorney general’s later public remarks.
Rokita’s office did not immediately reply to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s request for comment on the dismissal. 
Story continues below.
25S-DI-29
 
The case, filed in January, accused Rokita of contradicting his earlier discipline by denying wrongdoing in a press release and media interviews after the court publicly reprimanded him in November 2023. 
That earlier reprimand stemmed from comments Rokita made about Indianapolis physician Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who performed an abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio.
In that case, Rokita admitted in a sworn affidavit, to violating two professional conduct rules in exchange for a public reprimand. A third count was dismissed.
The Indiana Supreme Court approved the agreement, publicly reprimanding the Republican attorney general. Bernard was also disciplined before the Medical Licensing Board for discussing the procedure publicly.

Although he agreed not to contest the charges, the conflict resumed after Rokita issued a news release and gave interviews suggesting he had not actually done anything wrong. He said he had “evidence and explanation” for what he said on air, but chose not to fight the complaint any further to save “taxpayer money and distraction.”
The commission filed a new complaint in January, accusing Rokita of misleading the court and misrepresenting his acceptance of responsibility in the earlier disciplinary case.
The commission said Rokita acted with “a deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth” and has since opposed his request to dismiss the new charges.
The attorney general consistently maintained the professional conduct proceedings were the result of a politically charged and unaccountable disciplinary process.
Rokita attempted to get the new complaint dismissed, but the state supreme court ruled in July to let it go forward. At the time, justices said the issue “seems to boil down primarily to whether (Rokita) really meant it when he told us he was accepting responsibility.” They encouraged both parties to “get back on the same page.”
According to Thursday’s order, Rokita and the disciplinary commission “have successfully done just that.”
Public records show taxpayers had spent nearly $500,000 on Rokita’s legal defense in the matter as of late June.

,DC,2025-10-09 18:23:43+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump threatens 'permanent' cuts to Democratic programs on day nine of shutdown gridlock,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-threatens-permanent-cuts-democratic-programs-day-nine-shutdown-gridlock,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday he’s prepared to cancel funding approved by Congress that he believes is going toward programs supported by Democrats, though he didn’t share any additional details during a Cabinet meeting. ""We’ll be cutting some very popular Democratic programs that aren’t popular with Republicans,” he said. “They wanted to do this, so we’ll give them a little taste of their own medicine."" Meanwhile, on day nine of the government shutdown, members of the U.S. Senate for the seventh time failed to advance either a Democratic or Republican stopgap spending bill, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said partisan tensions in his chamber are so intense he is reluctant to bring members back until a resolution is found. “This gets personal. Emotions are high. People are upset. I'm upset,” Johnson told reporters at a morning press conference.Layoffs, denial of back pay also threatenedTrump has signaled throughout the shutdown he wants to unilaterally cancel funding approved by Congress, lay off federal workers by the thousands and may try to reinterpret a 2019 law that requires back pay for furloughed federal employees after the funding lapse ends. He has yet to give any real details on those plans or say exactly when he’ll try to take those steps, which would likely result in additional lawsuits. Trump said during the hour-long public portion of the Cabinet meeting that Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought would be able to share more details, but Vought never spoke and Trump didn’t call on him. “The shutdown has been, you know, pretty damaging. I mean, not yet, because it's early. But it gets a little bit worse as it goes along,” Trump said. “And we'll be making cuts that will be permanent and we're only going to cut Democrat programs. I hate to tell you. I guess that makes sense, but we're only cutting Democratic programs. But we’re going to start that and we have Russell, who can talk to you about it if he wants to.”The president is generally required to faithfully execute the laws that Congress approves, including the government funding bills. The White House budget office has frozen or canceled funding several times this year without going to lawmakers for approval, which is required under a 1970s law. That has led to a slew of lawsuits and the Government Accountability Office repeatedly citing the administration for illegally impounding funds. No progress on votesOn Capitol Hill, lawmakers remained deadlocked over how to advance a stopgap bill to fund the government for a few weeks. The Senate voted 54-45 on the House-passed bill that would fund federal programs through Nov. 21 and 47-50 on Democrats’ counterproposal that would provide spending authority through Oct. 31 and make substantial changes to health care policy. The tally for the seventh vote to advance those two proposals wasn’t much different from the previous ones. Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, both Democrats, as well as Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with Republicans to advance their bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted no.Legislation needs the support of at least 60 senators to advance under that chamber’s legislative filibuster rule. The vote came shortly after Speaker Johnson, R-La., made disparaging remarks about Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer during his press conference, with the two increasingly blaming each other for the funding impasse.  “There is one thing that Chuck Schumer cares about more than anything else and that is his Senate seat,” Johnson said. “The guy has been in Congress for 44 years. He doesn't know how to live life outside this building and so he will do anything to make sure that he keeps that seat.”Johnson, asked about the increasing tensions between Republicans and Democrats over the funding lapse and health care policy, said it is likely better to keep lawmakers in that chamber separated until a resolution is reached. “I’m a very patient man, but I am very angry right now because this is dangerous stuff,” Johnson said. “And so, is it better for them, probably, to be physically separated right now? Yeah, it probably is, frankly. “I wish that weren't the case. But we do have to turn the volume down. The best way to turn the volume down is to turn the lights back on and get the government open for the people.”Shutdown pay for members of the military Johnson reiterated that he does not intend to bring the House back from an extended recess to vote on a stand-alone bill to provide on-time paychecks to military members during the shutdown. Johnson stuck to his position that the best way to ensure pay for U.S. troops is for Democrats to pass the GOP stopgap spending bill, despite Trump breaking with Johnson on that particular issue. Trump, asked Wednesday about the upcoming Oct. 15 payday for military members, said “that probably will happen” and that the “military is always going to be taken care of.”But, Johnson said during his Thursday press conference the only way out is through the Republican stopgap bill that remains stalled in the Senate. “We have already voted to pay the troops. We did it three weeks ago. We put that bill on the floor, and the Republicans voted to pay the troops, TSA agents, border patrol, air traffic control and everybody else,” Johnson said. “So coming back here and doing it and having a duplicative vote to do the same thing they already did would accomplish nothing.”Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a floor speech the shutdown will not end until after Republicans and Democrats find a way to extend tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace past the end of the year. Schumer also rebuked Johnson for the House schedule, which has only had members in Washington, D.C., for 12 days since the end of July. “If you’re someone who works two jobs or weekends or overtime to make ends meet, what on Earth are you supposed to think when House Republicans can't even be bothered to show up to reopen the government?” Schumer said. New England senators initiate talksSenate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she has been speaking with New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen about possible solutions to the impasse. “I have been in very close contact with Sen. Shaheen, who is very constructive, and is trying to find a path forward,” Collins said.  “The ACA issue is important to a lot of us, not just to Democrats,” she added. “The tax subsidies were enhanced during COVID. They do need to be reformed, but they do need to be extended as well. They expire at the end of the year. We need to open up government today before more harm is done, before people in the military don't have their paychecks.” Ariana Figueroa and Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",,,,2025-10-09 14:58:22.815437

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline) The debate over whether North Carolina should continue running its own liquor system came up again this week, as House lawmakers again weighed the system’s efficiency against the hundreds of millions of dollars it funnels to state and local governments.
State lawmakers have discussed ending the state’s liquor monopoly for years, but the idea has never gained enough political traction to move forward, largely due to pushback from social conservatives and local governments who rely on the revenue the ABC system generates.
North Carolina is one of 17 “control states,” where the government manages the wholesale — and often retail — sale of liquor. Several other states have loosened control in recent decades.
Washington voters approved a ballot initiative in 2012 to privatize liquor sales and end state control over retail and distribution. West Virginia leased its state-owned stores to private operators in 1990, and Iowa sold its state-run stores to private businesses in the 1980s while retaining wholesale control.
On Wednesday, the House Select Committee on Government Efficiency heard from Hank Bauer, chair of the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, who defended North Carolina’s monopoly on liquor sales. He said the ABC system contributes $540 million to the state and another $170 million to local governments each year.
“We have the greatest system in the United States,” Bauer told the committee. “I have not found another state in the United States that gives more money back from their spirit system than what North Carolina does.”
Bauer warned that privatizing liquor sales would cost the state hundreds of millions in revenue and shift law enforcement costs now covered by local ABC boards.
“If we privatize, we’ll lose the $540 million we give back annually, and the $170 million local contribution would be 100% gone,” he said.
But some lawmakers questioned whether the state should be in the liquor business at all.
“The Libertarian in me says the state does not belong with its hand in the alcohol sales business,” said committee chair Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort). He said the committee should study the “true cost” of privatization.
Kidwell also raised concerns about local oversight. “In my district, I can tell you, there’s a significant amount of cronyism in the ABC boards,” he said.
But Rep. Shelly Willingham (D-Edgecombe), a Democrat representing Bertie, Edgecombe and Martin counties, said the ABC system benefits local communities.
Willingham, who also serves on a local ABC board, said the money helps fund public services. “We give money to the library, we help feed the hungry,” he said. “Not only do we give money locally for some of the mental health programs, but statewide, we give money to the state’s mental health and human services agencies.”
The state ABC commission is seeking $210 million to $220 million to build a new warehouse, which Bauer said could increase revenue by improving distribution and storage capacity. The current facility, he said, lacks automation.
“We’re touching product five times before we get it to a [local] board. If we were private retail, we’d be out of business,” Bauer said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ABC_Alcohol_photo-CHenkel-1.jpg,,,2025-10-09 14:58:22.815437

Artificial intelligence is now a common part of the hiring process, from screening résumés to conducting interviews. 
Roughly 90% of employers use some form of AI to filter or rank job applications, according to the World Economic Forum. Some large companies field millions of applications each year, and AI tools help recruiters manage the overwhelming volume of candidates. Some systems can even assess tone, language and facial expressions in recorded interviews. 
But the technology has sparked a new form of job-seeking strategy: applicants hiding coded instructions in their résumés to trick AI into assigning them a higher ranking. Recruiters are updating software to catch and reject manipulated applications. 
While AI makes hiring faster, experts warn that human oversight is still essential, particularly when evaluating traits like honesty, communication and cultural fit that algorithms cannot fully capture.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Former state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ chief of staff, who faced accusations of creating a hostile work environment, is gone from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.
The agency confirmed Thursday morning the departure of Matt Mohler, who joined Walters’ administration in January after moving from Florida. Several senior staff exits ensued in the months since Mohler’s hiring.
Mohler’s exit comes as new state Superintendent Lindel Fields takes over the Education Department and brings in his own administrative team. After Walters resigned Sept. 30, Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Fields to finish the final 15 months of the state superintendent’s term.
Stitt’s former chief of staff, Tom Newell, will take on the same title in Fields’ administration, said Tara Thompson, an agency spokesperson.
“I can confirm that Matt Mohler is no longer an OSDE employee,” Thompson said. “Staffing decisions are not made lightly, but because this is a personnel issue, I am not able to share further details.”
Mohler declined to comment to Oklahoma Voice.
It wasn’t immediately clear Thursday if he received severance pay.

The former secretary of the Oklahoma State Board of Education, Amy London, complained to the Education Department’s human resources office in June about Mohler’s conduct, according to a copy of her complaint that she provided to Oklahoma Voice. 
London alleged Mohler and one of his assistants had created a “disruptive and hostile work environment” and undercut her job duties. 
She said Mohler instructed her not to communicate with the state Board of Education until 24 hours before the board’s monthly meetings. That left the board with limited time to review hundreds of pages of information before casting votes. 
London then filed a workplace discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about her treatment at the agency. Walters’ administration fired her less than a week after she made the federal complaint.
She took the first step toward filing a lawsuit over her firing by submitting a demand for $100,000 from the agency last month.
London said she is grateful Mohler is no longer working at the Education Department.
“Mohler’s conduct raised ongoing concerns and consistently did not reflect the values or priorities of Oklahomans,” London said Thursday.

Tina Polsky. (Photo via Florida Senate)Legislation has again been filed to protect public employees who are qualified medical marijuana patients in Florida.
Broward County Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky’s proposal (SB 136) would prohibit a public employer from taking adverse personnel action against an employee or a job applicant for their use of medical marijuana if the employee is a qualified patient.
There are exceptions if the public employer can establish that the use of cannabis is impairing the worker’s ability to perform his or her job duties or responsibilities.
The proposal also says that if the public employer does have a drug testing policy and an employee or job applicant tests positive for THC, the employer must provide the employee or applicant written notice within five days about their right to provide an explanation for or contest the positive test.
Sen. Polsky has filed similar legislation that hasn’t moved in the GOP-controlled Legislature in recent years. Some of her earlier versions encompassed all medical marijuana patients around the state, not just those who are public employees.
Medical cannabis is legal in 38 states. About half of those states have anti-discrimination policies for medical cannabis patients, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The NCSL reports that “significantly fewer states require employers to carve out accommodations for these patients.”
There are 895,469 qualified medical marijuana patients in Florida, according to the Office of Medical Marijuana Use. That’s the most in the nation.
Polsky has also filed a bill (SB 130) to prohibit courts from denying or restricting certain parental rights based solely on a parent’s status as a qualified medical marijuana patient. It would also prohibit the presumption of neglect or child endangerment based solely on a parent’s status as a qualified medical marijuana patient.

(Photo by Sierra Pfeifer/KOSU)Mental health service providers are continuing to sound the alarm about budget cuts and their impact on services across Oklahoma.
Close to 30 people showed up to advocate for increased funding for mental health services at the Oklahoma Capitol building Tuesday evening. Senate and House Democrats hosted community members to discuss the state budget in advance of the next legislative session.
Many of the people who chose to speak shared personal stories about struggling with mental health. Antonio Garringer, who said he owes much of his success to Thunderbird Clubhouse in Norman, told the room about his struggle with social isolation. He said he has cerebral palsy and other diagnoses, like anxiety and depression, that made finding a community and proper treatment difficult.
“Even though I’ve only been a member for a very short time, I already feel a deep connection to many of the people there, and it has expanded my life so much,” Garringer said. “I would really urge that legislators reconsider the cuts to mental health and the Clubhouse, and to think about how that adversely affects so many people.”
Linn Blohm, the Executive Director of Thunderbird, said her nonprofit wasn’t spared from the significant budget cuts by the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS) that went into effect at the start of this month.
“So many of us say we value community and family, but then we don’t provide the tools for people to live lives with dignity,” Garringer said.
Other providers that experienced budget reductions and cuts also spoke out. Staff members from OCARTA, a social services nonprofit that connects people in recovery to peer support specialists, helped fill out the room.
“Our doors are closing because we’re considered ‘nonessential’ or ‘redundant,’ said OCARTA Executive Director Brani Vore.
“To be fair, ODMHSAS is carrying the weight of a statewide crisis, and the cost of that underinvestment doesn’t disappear, it only shifts,” she said. “Every dollar we don’t invest in people, we end up paying for somewhere else. In jails and hospitals, and too often, especially in our peer work for addiction mostly, but also in mental health, in funerals.”
Cuts from the Department of Mental Health come as the agency tries to correct years of financial mismanagement. It has maintained that decisions are being made with “essential services that align with the agency’s core mission and fiscal sustainability” in mind.
“ODMHSAS has been operating with more contracts than our budget can sustain,” Interim Commissioner Slavonic said after details about the cuts were leaked. “These were very difficult decisions, but we cannot spend more than we have.”
Others spoke on behalf of their children and their struggles to get them access to care. They asked the Democratic lawmakers in the room to “reach across the aisle” to their Republican counterparts and advocate for increased mental health funding.
Ashley Gay, a program manager at Heather’s Hope Housing, which offers transitional housing for women in Comanche, said she was able to rebuild her life with support.
“We need more programs like this and we need to fund them,” Gay told legislators. “I’ve seen what happens when people are given the tools to heal. I’ve also seen what happens when there’s more addiction, incarceration, homelessness, suicide. These are preventable outcomes, but only if we invest in prevention.”
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, hosted the event. After the almost two hours of public comment came to an end, said she was grateful so many people showed up to voice their concerns. Kirt said she reached out to mental health providers in advance, but was glad clients came to share their experiences, too.
“I think people are clear that their programming, the things that keep them going and the things that they do to serve the community is not seen and understood for its value,” she said. “And so I was glad to hear those stories directly.”
She said after listening to constituents speak, she’s concerned the Department of Mental Health is cutting essential services, as well as services it’s contractually obligated to fund.

Sam Garrison addresses reporters after being elected speaker-designate on Oct. 9, 2025. (Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)The Florida House on Thursday unanimously elected Republican Rep. Sam Garrison to be the next Speaker of the House.
Representing Fleming Island, a suburb of Jacksonville, Garrison will take over as speaker from 2026 until 2028. He’ll fill the shoes of sitting Speaker Danny Perez, a Miami Republican who dominated headlines for initiating a rare break with Gov. Ron DeSantis and insisting the House be “independent” from the executive branch.
Garrison, 48, spoke to House members during a designation ceremony Thursday morning, minutes after they unanimously nominated then elected him. These public elections are purely ceremonial — future speakers are decided years ahead of time behind closed doors.
“It is the House which most closely reflects the will of the people,” Garrison said from the rostrum. “The reason we run every two years, the reason we are three times the size of the Senate, and the reason this floor pulses with energy, vitality, and passion every time we gavel in.”
Because Republicans now enjoy a commanding legislative supermajority, Garrison warned against “complacency” while jabbing at the Democrats.
“The Democrats were more interested in internal power struggles and petty infighting than articulating and executing a vision that resonated with the people who put them here,” Garrison continued. “I believe with my whole heart that complacency is the single biggest threat to the conservative movement in Florida.
“This is not an external danger, it is internal. Our challenge isn’t the Democrats, it’s us.”
Garrison was first elected to state House District 11 in 2020. He’d attended Samford University for his undergraduate degree and the University of Illinois College of Law, becoming an attorney. The most controversial bill he sponsored was a ban on public sleeping, targeting homelessness in Florida.
Signed by DeSantis in 2024, the law requires municipalities to designate specific spaces for unhomed people to camp and sleep, complete with running water and mental health services. The law drew massive pushback from progressive groups deriding the homeless camps, claiming they would be inhumane and fiscally irresponsible.

There was a sliver of hope for LGBTQ+ Americans upon Donald Trump’s first election to the presidency. For a Republican, at least, maybe he wouldn’t be so bad for the queer community. The former reality TV star had made promises. He said he would be a “friend” to LGBTQ+ people. He vowed to protect them.
And by all accounts, his past seemed to suggest he meant it. In 2000, during his short-lived bid for the Reform Party’s presidential nomination, Trump touted to LGBTQ+ magazine The Advocate that his New York upbringing instilled in him a kind of tolerance. He had no problem hiring gay people, he said.
“I like the idea of amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include a ban of discrimination based on sexual orientation,” he told The Advocate. “It would be simple. It would be straightforward.”

This story was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Trump’s pledge to update the Civil Rights Act didn’t come out of nowhere. LGBTQ+ advocates had been campaigning for that very same thing in the form of the Equality Act, which had failed to clear Congress since 1974.
Today, the idea of Trump supporting the Equality Act, which would bar discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in major areas of public life, seems far-fetched. But 25 years ago — even 10 years ago — Trump’s name was hardly synonymous with homophobia or transphobia. The real estate mogul had branded himself as agnostic on social issues if not liberal.
It was not until he took office and began courtship with major anti-LGBTQ+ organizations that Trump’s policies included a slate of anti-trans moves. Before that time, Trump expressed indifference, or even support for transgender people.
His past statements and behavior raise serious questions about the sincerity of his anti-trans animus now. Does he truly want to erase transgender people from public life? Or are they an unfortunate tool to curry favor with diehard conservatives? Would the president admit to either? And in the end, does it matter?
In 2012, when he co-owned the Miss Universe pageant, Trump praised that year’s Miss USA, Olivia Culpo, for stating that transgender women should be allowed to compete.
“But today where there are so many surgeries and so many people out there who have a need to change for a happier life, I do accept that because I believe it’s a free country,” said Culpo, who went on to be crowned Miss Universe.
“She gave a great answer, a very tough question — on transgender — just the question everybody wants to hear, and she gave a great answer and she really did a great job,” Trump said of Culpo on Fox and Friends in June 2012.
CNN also noted that Trump ended a ban on trans participation in his own pageants and cited Olympic rules, which allow transgender women to compete.
As recently as 2016, Trump repeatedly stated that transgender people should use whatever bathrooms they felt were appropriate.
Even as Trump had started to take a harder line against same-sex marriage by 2016, he was still quoted in the press saying that former Olympian turned reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner could use “any bathroom she chooses” in his own Trump Tower.

Most significantly, in 2016, Trump opposed North Carolina’s House Bill 2, one of the first bills of its kind in the country to require people to use the bathroom corresponding to their birth sex. The measure cost the state an estimated $3.7 billion amid boycotts from companies, sports leagues and entertainers. It was fully repealed in 2020.
According to The New York Times, Trump had noted that there had been very few problems to precipitate the ban.
“North Carolina did something — it was very strong — and they’re paying a big price,” Trump said. “And there’s a lot of problems. And I heard — one of the best answers I heard was from a commentator yesterday saying, leave it the way it is, right now.”
In 2016, The New York Times, considering his candidacy, concluded that Trump was simply a more gay-friendly option among the GOP presidential candidates that year, noting that he supported trans people using public restrooms and was rumored to be the first private club owner in Palm Beach, Florida, to welcome a gay couple.
Charlotte Clymer, a transgender writer and activist, said she remembers that the community was wary of Trump as a Republican before he took office in 2016.
“But it wasn’t as though he was attacking trans people at the time, he wasn’t,” she said. “What I recall is that there was no deep concern from anyone I followed over Trump’s feelings toward the trans community.”
All of that is a far cry from the Trump of today, who has made the eradication of transgender people from public life a hallmark of his second administration.
But in his first administration, advocates were still uncertain about what kind of president he would be for LGBTQ+ Americans, said a spokesperson for queer media nonprofit GLAAD, who asked not to use her name because staff from the organization now receive threats of violence for talking to the press on LGBTQ+ issues.
“The leadership at GLAAD started doing the Trump Accountability Project on the first day of the administration when they noticed that they removed all LGBTQ mention from the White House website,” said the spokesperson. “So we’ve been documenting the policies and statements ever since that day.”
As of publication, the Trump Accountability Tracker has counted 367 attacks against LGBTQ+ Americans by both of Trump’s administrations.
Asked to comment on Trump’s evolution on queer and trans issues, Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, issued the following statement, in full:
“Woke Democrats want to destroy girls [sic] sports and threaten their private spaces by letting men compete against them and infiltrate their locker rooms and bathrooms. Millions of Americans agree with President Trump’s embrace of commonsense policy to protect women. The woke left’s support of transgender for everyone is a disgrace!”
In Trump’s inaugural speech in January, he vowed that his federal government would recognize just two genders: male and female. He has made good on that promise — trying to bar trans people from updating their passports, removing mentions of trans Americans from national monuments, issuing an executive order to ban trans girls from extracurricular sports, reinstating the ban on transgender people serving in the military, slashing funding for LGBTQ+ programs and trying to skirt federal law by placing transgender women detained in federal prisons with men.
GLAAD said it’s difficult to determine what changed for Trump between 2015 and now that has made him take such a hard line on transgender issues.
Clymer believes it was simple politics. Trans people, she said, are a tool Trump uses to rile GOP hardliners.
“I think that him making transphobia a centerpiece of his presidency is mostly about pandering to his base and the result of whomever was in his ear last at any given moment, and it just so happens that the vast majority of the people who are in his ear are anti-trans,” Clymer said. “I think you know, if tomorrow, his closest advisers told him to either chill out on transphobia or even become neutral again on trans issues, he would do so immediately.”
GLAAD’s research shows that less than 30% of Americans know a transgender person. Trump is part of that 30%. He knew the transgender contestants in his beauty pageants and was friends with Jenner before taking office.
But Trump is also aware that he is in the minority and is using that to his advantage, GLAAD said.
Ultimately, whether Trump truly feels hostility toward the LGBTQ+ community hardly matters, Clymer said.
“What are the policy outcomes of his presidency?” she asked. “By a mile, if you look at the results of his policies, he is by far, the most anti-LGBTQ president ever.”

(Getty images)The Louisiana Department of Public Health is urging caution around receiving suspicious botox injections from unlicensed sources in a non-medical setting after reports of severe illness. 
September brought two reports of severe illness in Louisiana residents following botulinum toxin injections, commonly referred to as botox. One patient ordered unlicensed botox online, and one received injections outside a medical office from a provider with unknown licensing. Both residents had to be hospitalized for severe illnesses resembling botulism, a rare and dangerous infection that attacks the nervous system. 
Botulism infection is considered a medical emergency that can be fatal. Symptoms include blurred or double vision, difficulty breathing and muscle paralysis that can sometimes lead to death. 
Botox is an approved medication for cosmetic procedures such as wrinkle removal and for treatment of medical conditions including chronic migraines, muscle spasms and bladder dysfunction. It must be sold and administered by licensed professionals for all uses. 
Unlicensed botox vendors often use online platforms such as TikTok and WhatsApp to advertise and coordinate sales of counterfeit botox, according to state health officials. Counterfeit botox can be misbranded, contaminated or improperly stored, leading to increased risk of hospitalization and infection. 
The Louisiana Department of Health urges the public to report instances of suspected counterfeit botox. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has a reporting hotline, 800-551-3989, and an online form.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1324474258-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-09 13:58:05.267325
,California,2025-10-09 17:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Student test scores surge, but still lag behind pre-pandemic levels",Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/10/smarter-balanced-test-california/,"The Smarter Balanced standardized test results increased for almost every student group and every grade, in every subject.","In summary
The Smarter Balanced standardized test results increased for almost every student group and every grade, in every subject.



California’s K-12 students are emerging from the pandemic malaise, posting the most significant academic improvements in years, according to state test scores released today.
The Smarter Balanced standardized test results show increases for almost every student group and every grade, in every subject. Some of the biggest improvements were among students who have struggled the most.
“This is good news, we love to see this kind of improvement,” said Lupita Cortez Alcalá, executive director of Policy Analysis for California Education, a nonpartisan research organization. “It shows that the state’s investments in student mental health and other initiatives are working.” 
In English language arts, 48.8% of students scored high enough to be considered proficient or advanced; 37% of students were in math. Those numbers both represent a 1.8 percentage-point increase from last year. By comparison, English language scores dropped a full point and math scores fell nearly 6 points after the pandemic and hadn’t budged much since then.
In 2024-25, science scores jumped 2 percentage points, to 32.7%, the biggest jump since California launched ambitious new science standards a decade ago. Until this year, scores had been stagnant due to the pandemic and slow rollout of the Next Generation Science Standards, which focus on hands-on projects and interactive, multidisciplinary lessons.
Education officials attributed the surge in scores to a host of initiatives that sprung from the pandemic era but are just now beginning to show results on a large scale. Among them: community schools, a $4.1 billion effort to bring mental health, medical and social services to schools; a $4.7 billion expansion of youth mental health services at schools and elsewhere; the rollout of transitional kindergarten to all 4-year-olds; expanded summer and after-school programs; universal school meals; and the gradual shift to a phonics-based reading curriculum.
Much of the funding for those programs has been through one-time federal and state grants. The federal money has either expired or is in jeopardy due to President Donald Trump’s cuts to education, but Gov. Gavin Newsom has so far kept most of the state funding intact.
Test scores point to continuing struggles 
The scores weren’t all good news. Students have not quite rebounded from the pandemic-related learning loss. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when schools were closed for more than a year in most of the state, students fell behind academically and generally disengaged from school. Attendance, though recently improved, has been a persistent problem for most districts. The test scores reflect that: English language arts scores still lag nearly three percentage points below the pre-pandemic scores, and math scores are nearly 2.5 percentage points behind. 
The gaps between Black and Latino and white and Asian students narrowed a bit, but 
gaps between low-income and wealthier students widened in all subjects. 
“While it’s certainly encouraging to see overall increases in test scores, it’s unacceptable that the achievement gap has widened,” said Jessica Sawko, education director at the research and advocacy organization Children Now. “The persistent and widening gap must be addressed as a matter of urgency.”
Nearly 63% of California’s students are low-income, and schools get extra money to serve those students. The state needs to hold schools accountable for how well they’re educating low-income students, Sawko said.
Results for English learners who took the English Language Proficiency Assessment were mostly unchanged from last year.
Most school districts saw improvements, including Los Angeles Unified, which saw big gains in all subjects. English language arts scores jumped almost 3.5 percentage points, and math scores rose nearly 4 points. The district said those were the biggest test score increases ever.
Compton Unified in Los Angeles County also saw some of the largest gains in the state. English language arts scores soared 8 percentage points, and math scores jumped 6.5 points. Both scores far surpassed the state averages. 
Superintendent Darin Brawley credited the improvements on a district-wide focus on data and accountability. Teachers regularly test the students, so they’re able to pinpoint who needs extra help. The district has also invested heavily in tutoring. 
“I’m very, very pleased with our scores, but I’m not surprised,” Brawley said. “We work very hard to align our curriculum to the assessments, and make sure our students know what to expect. By the time the (state) assessment comes around, nothing is a surprise to them.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061825_St-Hope-Charter-School_MG_CM_31.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-09 13:58:05.267325

Johnson said the Alabama Crime Victims Compensation Commission has received one application in connection with the Montgomery mass shooting. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Crime Victims Compensation Commission (ACVCC) has received one application from a victim of the Montgomery mass shooting on Saturday.
Everette Johnson, executive director of the commission, said after the commission’s meeting Thursday that while he can’t discuss details of the application for compensation, it came for one of the deceased victims. Two people died in the shooting: Jeremiah Morris, 17, and Shalanda Williams, 43.
Johnson said that the application will be reviewed by the commission and himself to determine how much compensation the victim is eligible for. Generally, that could be used to pay for hospital bills, the funeral and counseling.
“The victim has to have been a direct threat of violence, and then the families associated with that,” Johnson said. “Immediate family would probably be eligible.”
Tykeria Mays, Williams’ daughter, started a GoFundMe for funeral expenses to give her mother the “proper homecoming she deserves.” As of late Thursday morning, $3,645 has been raised.
Montgomery Police Chief James Graboys said Tuesday at a press conference that there are multiple persons of interest, but no arrests have been made. The shooting injured 12 more people, five with life-threatening injuries and seven with non-life-threatening injuries.

Intoxicating hemp products are items that contain THC that are sold anywhere other than licensed marijuana dispensaries including gas stations, smoke shops, and CBD stores, among others. This ban includes THC-infused beverages.

“I am taking action today … to get these products off the streets and to have them taken off our shelves,” DeWine said Wednesday during a press conference. “Intoxicating hemp is dangerous, and we need to better protect our children. … We believe this is the right thing to do.”
The 90-day executive order ends on Jan. 12, 2026, and then it will be up to the lawmakers to decide if they want to see further action taken on intoxicating hemp. 
“I’m not going to tell them what to do, but we have to have some control of this product,” DeWine said. “We can’t have a situation where it is legal for people to sell this to underage kids.”
Those shops who violate the executive order could be subject to a $500 fine for each day intoxicating hemp products remain on their shelves.
The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC. 
“After these laws were passed, chemists began manipulating compounds in the legal, non-intoxicated hemp plant, turning these compounds into intoxicating THC, including Delta-8 and Delta-9, which are found in marijuana,” DeWine said. “… It’s a totally different product.”
Marijuana is not considered an intoxicating hemp product and is legal in Ohio. 
DeWine has been calling on lawmakers to regulate or ban delta-8 THC products since January 2024. He previously said he was not able to sign an executive order about hemp.
“We believe we have the authority to do this, and I’m not going to sit back and not do it,” DeWine said, explaining how he went back to his lawyers.
It was previously reported Ohio was one of about 20 states that does not have any regulations around intoxicating hemp products, according to an Ohio State University Drug Enforcement and Policy Center study from November 2024. 
It was reported in January 2024 that there had been at least 257 reports of delta-8 poisoning in Ohio in recent years — including 102 in 2023 and 40 that involved children under six-years-old, according to the Ohio Poison Control Center. 
“Since intoxicating hemp products, such as delta-8, became widely available, the number of accidental reasonings among children has risen sharply,” said Dr. Hannah Hays, medical director of the Central Ohio Poison Center and Chief of Toxicology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.

Children who ingest intoxicating hemp products can experience drowsiness, hallucinations, confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures, and respiratory failure, Hays said. 
“I don’t want the product sold to children,” DeWine said. “I think the danger to our children is clear, and I’m taking action today to protect Ohio’s children. These children are vulnerable to these candy knock-off products that are on sale today across the state of Ohio.” 
DeWine had three intoxicating hemp products with him during Wednesday’s press conference — Stoner Patch Dummies (similar packaging to Sour Patch Kids), Nerdy Bears (similar to Nerds Gummy Clusters), and Sour Infused Gummies (similar to Gushers). 
“With intoxicating hemp, this product has no restriction on where it can be sold or who can buy it,” DeWine said. “Intoxicating hemp has no required regulatory testing … and sold in packages enticing to children, many times mimicking the packaging of common candies.” 
A Nerdy Bear gummy bear contains more than 100 milligrams THC, according to the packaging. 
“For context, many adult produced products will contain 10 milligrams of THC per serving,” DeWine said. “Certainly, it’s easy to see how a child will confuse this product with real candy and eat a few gummy bears and ingest enough THC to require hospitalization.”
The Ohio Cannabis Coalition praised DeWine’s executive order. 
“For too long, the hemp industry has recklessly exploited the Farm Bill loophole to line its pockets at the expense of Ohioans’ health,” OHCANN Executive Director David Bowling said in a statement. “Until today, unregulated synthetic hemp-derived cannabinoids were sold openly, putting consumers, especially children, at risk.” 
The hemp industry, however, was quick to speak out against DeWine’s executive order. 
“Governor DeWine’s executive order banning hemp is an attack on Ohio’s consumers who will lose access to safe and legal products, and a gut punch to Ohio farmers and small businesses who have invested tens of millions building legitimate businesses in good faith under existing laws,” Ohio Healthy Alternatives Association Executive Director Michael Tindall said in a statement. 
He said there are more than 2,000 smoke and hemp shops, and more than 4,000 retailers throughout Ohio that sell hemp products.
DeWine’s executive order is a “misguided overreach,” said Jonathan Miller, General Counsel of the U.S. Hemp Roundtable. 
“We are outraged that the Governor is attempting to bypass the Ohio legislature and misuse executive powers to deliver a crushing, job-killing blow to the state’s hemp industry,” Miller said in a statement. “Instead of prohibition, Ohio should pursue regulation — setting age limits, mandating independent third-party testing, requiring accurate labeling, and ensuring products are made with American-grown hemp.”
Dakota Sawyer of American Republic Policy agrees that intoxicating hemp products should not be in the hands of children, but disagrees with DeWine’s approach to ban all products since he said there are stores with age restrictions. 
“We should be going after the bad actors, but not punishing the good actors,” he said. “This executive order will shut (the good actors) down. This will put them out of business. People won’t be able to put food on their plates for their families.” 
State Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, said the executive order is an overstep.
“I believe the legislature’s job is to legislate,” he said. “I do not believe it’s the governor’s job to legislate.” 
Intoxicating hemp bills 
There are a handful of bills in the legislature that would regulate intoxicating hemp products in various ways. 
Ohio Senate Bill 266 would ban the sale of intoxicating hemp products to people under 21, ban the sale of intoxicating hemp products that have not been tested under the same rules as marijuana and would prevent selling intoxicating hemp products that appeal to children. 
Ohio Senate Bill 86 would ban intoxicating hemp products sales to anyone under 21, impose a 10% tax on intoxicating hemp products and regulate drinkable cannabinoid products. 
The bill would require intoxicating hemp products to be sold only at adult-use marijuana dispensaries instead of allowing them to be sold at CBD stores, convenience stores, smoke shops, or gas stations. It would require intoxicating hemp products to only be sold if the products have been tested and comply with standards for packing, labeling, and advertising.  
Ohio Senate Bill 56 would only allow a licensed marijuana dispensary to sell intoxicating hemp products that have been tested and complied with packaging, labeling and advertising requirements. The bill, which passed in the Senate earlier this year, would also change parts of the state’s marijuana law. 
Ohio House Bill 160 mostly deals with potential changes to the state’s marijuana laws, but it also has an intoxicating hemp provision that would require every THC product to only be sold at Ohio’s regulated marijuana dispensaries.

(Photo by Tero Vesalainen/Getty Images)Another poll concluded that a majority of Hoosiers oppose a GOP effort to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterms, a move that would potentially eliminate two seats held by Democrats.
North Star Opinion Research, on behalf of Independent Indiana, found that 53% of Indiana registered voters don’t support the move, compared to 34% in favor. The Virginia-based firm found that opposition was slightly higher in the Indianapolis media market at 55%, compared to 51% outside of that area.
Republican respondents, however, support it by a margin of 59% to 25%; while independents and Democrats are opposed by margins of 59% to 28% and 85% to 11%, respectively.
“Voters are frustrated with how things are working in Indiana,” said Dan Judy, the vice president of North Star Opinion Research. “Our polling clearly shows that voters in Indiana do not believe redistricting is the right thing to do at this moment. Moreover, they want to see changes to the electoral system that give them better options and opportunities moving forward.”
Of Indiana’s nine congressional seats, Democrats hold one in Indianapolis and another in northwestern Indiana. The maps were drawn in 2021 following extensive public hearings. The poll’s findings come as Vice President JD Vance returns to the Hoosier State in an attempt to sway Senate Republicans in a closed-door caucus on Friday.

Several voting rights groups, including MADVoters, Indiana Conservation Voters and Common Cause Indiana, will be part of a rally at the Indiana Statehouse against the redistricting effort on Friday at noon. 

“The data is clear: Hoosier voters don’t want politicians redrawing our Congressional maps in mid-stream to give one party an advantage,” said Nathan Gotsch, the executive director of Independent Indiana. “What they do want is a fair system—one that ends straight-ticket voting and holds independent, Republican, and Democratic candidates to the same standards.”
The 604 Hoosiers polled this week were mostly contacted by phone, though 29% were reached by text-to-web on a cell phone. Another poll, conducted in August, similarly found that just over half of Hoosiers opposed mid-cycle redistricting.
Independent Indiana, which supports independent candidates throughout the state, also quizzed Hoosiers on the state’s signature requirements and straight-ticket voting. Two-thirds of polled voters thought that the 4,000-signature requirement for independent candidates to run for Congress was “unfair,” while a quarter supported the standard. Support was higher among independent voters and Democrats — at 76% to 71%, respectively — compared to 56% of Republicans.
Similarly, Republican voters were more likely to support straight-ticket voting, which allows a voter to select all of a party’s candidates at once. The majority of Hoosiers polled, or 62%, agreed it was a “bad thing,” while 26% said it was a “good thing.” Just under half, or 49%, of Republicans didn’t like straight ticket voting, compared to 72% of independents and 62% of Democrats.
“Whether they identify as Republicans, Democrats, or independents, Indiana voters want an even playing field in our elections,” Gotsch concluded. “The current push for mid-decade redistricting is the opposite of that.”
North Star regularly polls for GOP candidates and national Republican committees.

The Missouri Supreme Court on Sept. 30 refused to hear an appeal in the Cole County lawsuit that initially awarded four plaintiffs $1.56 billion. The October 2023 jury award was reduced to $611 million by Circuit Judge Daniel Green, a decision upheld in May by the Western District Court of Appeals. 
In a statement to The Independent not attributed to any individual, Bayer said it was considering whether there were further appeals that could be filed.
“We continue to believe that significant and reversible errors were committed during trial and the appellate phase and warrant review by a higher court,” the company stated.
Matthew Clement, a Jefferson City attorney who worked on the case, said there are no appeals left except for an unlikely review by the U.S. Supreme Court. There is another Missouri case seeking an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court but justices have not decided whether to accept it.
“That’s rarely successful in state cases,” Clement said, “but they can certainly ask them to do that.”  
The case is one of the few out of thousands filed in Cole County that has become final. As it fights in court, Bayer has also lobbied heavily for legislation to protect it from lawsuits at both the state and federal level.
Political attacks stiffen opposition to Missouri bill protecting pesticide makers 

The company has failed for two years to win passage of a bill intended to shield it from litigation in Missouri. The bill narrowly passed the Missouri House earlier this year but lobbying missteps, including a campaign targeting some of the most conservative members of the state Senate, doomed it. The company did win passage of similar legislation in North Dakota and in Georgia
Bayer has also sought protection from Congress. The spending bill to fund the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department would add protections intended to block state lawsuits. Similar language is being considered for inclusion in a new Farm Bill. 
Bayer has faced an avalanche of litigation that claims glyphosate, the product patented by Missouri-based Monsanto in 1971, causes non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma — and that the label fails to warn users of the risk. 
Bayer acquired Monsanto in 2018 and operates its facilities under the name Bayer Crop Science.
Bayer has paid out about $11 billion to settle almost 100,000 lawsuits with approximately 61,000 pending, according to a website that tracks the litigation involving Roundup. The company has already stopped making Roundup with glyphosate for home use and, in September, announced it was seeking regulatory approval for a new herbicide to replace Roundup for agricultural and commercial use in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia and Brazil.
In the statement about the lawsuit, the company pointed to an April article in the Wall Street Journal about the future of Roundup.
“We’re pretty much reaching the end of the road,” Bayer chief executive Bill Anderson told the newspaper. “We’re talking months, not years.”
 Plaintiffs and the award

In the case that is now final, a jury found that Jimmy Draeger of Eldon was due $5.6 million in compensatory damages and his wife, Brenda Draeger, was due $100,000 for loss of companionship as a result of his illness.
Draeger used Roundup to manage weeds on his property in Miller County.
The litigation also included Daniel Anderson of Lemon Grove, California, who was 32 when he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after regularly using Roundup to manage weeds on his father’s property. He was awarded $38 million in compensatory damages.

Valorie Gunther, who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after nearly 40 years of using Roundup to prevent and kill weeds on various properties she owned in New York, was awarded $17.5 million as part of the Cole County lawsuit.
The jury also awarded each plaintiff $500 million in punitive damages. Those awards were reduced by Green to $50.4 million for Jimmy Draeger, $342 million for Anderson and $157.5 million for Gunther.
The awards have been increasing at 9% interest until paid and the total is now in excess of $700 million.
The decision from the jury went beyond a claim that Monsanto — and later, Bayer — failed to warn users of potential risks to their health, Clement said. The jury also found that the company was liable for a design defect in its product and was negligent in taking action to protect consumers.
In its statement to The Independent, Monsanto said the courts didn’t recognize that it had already paid punitive damages in other cases and the compensatory awards should have been limited to actual medical expenses paid by the plaintiffs.
“The appellate court also failed to recognize that federal law preempts (the) plaintiff’s state-based failure to warn theory,” the statement read.
The company tried to win in court on those points, Clement said.
“Monsanto has made these arguments in front of numerous courts, and numerous judges and the courts have consistently found that Monsanto’s position is wrong,” he said.
Under state law, the plaintiffs and their attorneys won’t be the only beneficiaries of the award. Half of the punitive damages award will be deposited in the state’s Tort Victims Compensation Fund, which makes grants of up to $300,000 to people who prevail in lawsuits where the limits of insurance or other sources to pay the judgment are inadequate for the injuries. 
About one-quarter of the money deposited in the Tort Victims Compensation Fund will go to a fund supporting legal services for the indigent plaintiffs through four legal service organizations: Legal Aid of Western Missouri, Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, Legal Services of Southern Missouri and Mid-Missouri Legal Services
 The next fights

On Jan. 4, the day Missouri lawmakers return to Jefferson City for their annual session, a trial is scheduled to open in another case with four plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs are James Greco of Feasterville Trevose, Pennsylvania, who used Roundup for 30 years around his home and those of his family and while working for his father’s landscaping business; Thomas Rainwater of Earlington, Kentucky, who used Roundup while doing building reclamation work and at his home; Gary Roth of Marlboro, New Jersey who used Roundup from 1984 to 2003 while at work and at his home, as well as the home of his mother and his mother’s friends; and Jordan Harrison of Kingston, North Carolina, who worked in tobacco fields sprayed with Roundup and used it around his home.
All four plaintiffs were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma while in their 40s.
During this year’s legislative session, Bayer, a group called the the Modern Ag Alliance and the Protecting America Initiative, listed as an “electioneering communication” organization by the Federal Election Commission, spent heavily on radio and television ads, as well as flyers targeting individual lawmakers, in pursuit of the bill to protect Bayer from liability.
The ads present glyphosate as a benign, beneficial chemical essential to modern agriculture. 
Among the company’s political allies, preaching the benefits of Roundup and decrying the litigation targeting its use, are Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe and newly-appointed Attorney General Catherine Hanaway. 
Lawyer demands records of Bayer’s Roundup ‘propaganda’ campaign in Missouri

Clement, who is among the lawyers preparing for the January trial, has been trying to pry loose company records on how much it has spent to influence legislators, the public and potential jurors.
A motion to make public relations documents public has been pending since March. Clement said he will push the court for a ruling before lawmakers return for the 2026 session.
The lawsuits, taken as a whole, have two goals, Clement said.
“The first would be to warn people about what this product really does, and allow them to make their own decisions about whether they want to use it,” he said.
The second goal is for Bayer to offer a safer alternative. The notices about Bayer seeking regulatory approval for a new product is an encouraging sign, he said.
“If they have the technology and the means to make a safer product,” Clement said, “that’s what we encourage them to do.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20210914_083212-scaled-e1725891537627-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-09 12:58:44.330332

Larry Rhoden speaks to the media  on Aug. 26, 2025, at the Tri-State Governors' Conference in Dakota Dunes. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Larry Rhoden spent his first eight months as governor steering South Dakota onto the high ground of civil discourse, only to follow Kristi Noem back into the gutter last week.
Noem, the head of the federal Department of Homeland Security, was in Broadview, Illinois. Protesters have been amassing for weeks at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility there to express disapproval with the Trump administration, resulting in clashes with authorities. 
Following her usual impulse to provoke rather than problem-solve, Noem inserted herself into the tense situation with YouTuber and podcaster Benny Johnson in tow, filming her every confrontational move. That included a stroll up to the door of the Village of Broadview Municipal Building with her entourage to ask if she could use the restroom.
Somebody standing on the inside of the door kept it shut and said “no you cannot.”
Noem swiveled and stormed off.
“That’s what Governor Pritzker says is cooperation and keeping people safe,” she blurted on her way past Johnson as he filmed the encounter.
Indeed, how could JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, forget his solemn oath to support the constitution, faithfully discharge his duties, and facilitate bathroom breaks for presidential Cabinet secretaries?

Rhoden, a Republican who succeeded Noem as South Dakota’s governor in January, was similarly offended. He shared the footage of Noem’s bathroom brouhaha on X (formerly Twitter) and added his own written comments. 
“Kristi is the toughest woman I know,” Rhoden said. “If Pritzker thinks a locked door will stop her from enforcing the LAW, then he is severely underestimating my friend.”
But Rhoden wasn’t finished. He followed Noem onto the low road and went even lower in his attack on Pritzker.
“Maybe he should clean up Chicago,” Rhoden said. “Or at least eat a salad.”
That’s apparently supposed to be a joke about Pritzker’s well-chronicled efforts to lose weight. 
Not laughing? Neither am I.
It’s disappointing that Rhoden would write those words or allow them to be written on his behalf. It’s also hypocritical coming from a hat-wearing cowboy who’s been on a high horse lecturing South Dakotans about civility ever since he pledged, upon becoming governor, that it would be “one of the pillars of my administration.”
As recently as Sept. 12, Rhoden philosophized about the importance of “civil discourse” in the weekly column he distributes to the media. He said civility is the best way to honor Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist and commentator who was fatally shot a couple of days earlier in Utah.

This screenshot taken on Oct. 6, 2025, shows an Oct. 4 post to Gov. Larry Rhoden’s account on X (formerly Twitter).

On the same day he released that column, Rhoden used his official Facebook account to advocate — unsuccessfully, as it turned out — for the firing of a University of South Dakota professor who posted insensitive comments about Kirk in the hours after the shooting.
“We must not send the message to our kids that this is acceptable public discourse,” Rhoden said.
That effort to tear down a USD professor’s career for ill-advised but constitutionally protected free speech stands in contrast to Pritzker’s past efforts to build up the same university. In 2007, Pritzker’s family foundation donated $5 million to help build the Theodore R. and Karen K. Muenster University Center, named in honor of the parents of Pritzker’s wife, Mary Kathryn “MK” Pritzker, who was raised in South Dakota.
Rhoden, meanwhile, is fixated on more recent contributions totaling $790,000 from Pritzker’s issue-based nonprofit, Think Big America, to support a ballot question last fall that would have added abortion rights to the South Dakota constitution. Voters rejected the measure, as Rhoden noted in his X post about Noem’s bathroom video.
“The last time JB Pritzker picked a fight” with Noem and South Dakota, Rhoden said, “it didn’t go well for him.”
Perhaps Rhoden needs a reminder that contributing to a ballot question committee does not equate to picking a fight, and a disagreement over immigration policy does not justify a demeaning comment about a fellow governor.
If he doesn’t know that, he should spend more time reflecting on his own words from last month, when he admonished everyone to honor Charlie Kirk’s legacy by “continuing to talk to each other and focusing on reason and principle, rather than personal attacks.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/591A0989-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-09 12:58:44.330332

(U.S. Navy photo by Branden Bourque)When Maine Rep. Kristi Mathieson attended an event at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard late last month, numerous people thanked her for a piece of legislation she sponsored earlier this year, which she said was unusual. 
However, these were federal employees who were already starting to get nervous about the threat of a government shutdown and many of them said they were better able to face the prospect of having to work without pay because they knew the state would have their back this time around. 
Mathieson, a Democrat from Kittery, introduced LD 874  with those exact constituents in mind. The shipyard in Kittery employs non-military personnel who repair and modernize the U.S. Navy’s nuclear-powered attack submarine fleet.
Mathieson’s proposal created a zero-interest loan program for federal workers who are affected by a government shutdown. It received bipartisan support and took effect on Sept. 24. 
Working in preventative medicine as a dietitian, Mathieson said she prefers to take steps to avoid situations becoming a catastrophe rather than trying to respond after the fact. Although, she didn’t realize quite how timely the legislation would be.
One week after it took effect, on Oct. 1, the federal government shut down for the first time in nearly seven years. The shutdown is ongoing as of Thursday, reaching the ninth day that many federal employees are expected to show up for work without pay. 
Shutdown day eight: Congress standoff unchanged as first missed federal payday nears

Mathieson said this can create hardship for her constituents and the more than 10,000 federal workers in the state who may now struggle to pay for child care or gas to keep showing up for work without knowing when their next paycheck is coming.
“These federal employees are such a backbone to our essential services,” Mathieson said, such as border security or TSA workers at the airport. “They’re not the architects of our government shutdown, but they are the ones used as bargaining chips.”
The new state-backed loan program provides eligible employees up to three loans during a partial or full government shutdown lasting more than seven days. Each loan can be equal to the worker’s monthly take-home pay after taxes minus any unemployment benefits they may be receiving. However, there is a maximum of $6,000 per loan. 
The program is administered by the Finance Authority of Maine. Banks and other financial institutions are not required to participate in the new loan offering, but can choose to by filling out a simple application. 
The legislation also allocated $250,000 in state funding to repay financial institutions in case of any defaults on these loans. With that backing from the state, the loans are provided with zero interest and are not dependent on the worker’s credit history.
Mathieson said she is aware of a handful of banks that are interested in participating or have filled out initial applications, including Kennebunk Savings, which has 12 branches in Maine. While the bank hadn’t issued any loans as of Thursday morning, it expects to be offering it “very soon,” according to Communications Administrator Jennifer Radel.
“As an organization committed to helping meet the needs of our community members, we recognize the hardship faced by residents who are being affected by the government shutdown,” Radel said. 
Interested lenders can download the application on the FAME website.

The environment department says this example of such a label is not yet finalized. (Courtesy NM Environment Department)The state health department on Wednesday put forward proposed rules that will be used to implement a new law regulating the use of so-called “forever chemicals” in consumer productions.
House Bill 212—the PFAS Protection Act—passed by New Mexico lawmakers in the regular 2025 legislative session, institutes the gradual phasing out of intentionally added per-and-polyfluouroalkyl substances—PFAS— in everyday items.
 “These rules will prevent toxic PFAS chemicals from unknowingly entering the places where we live, work and play,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. “From cookware and food packaging, to furniture and cleaning supplies, to adult hygiene products and baby clothes and toys—these rules will protect the health of New Mexicans and our environment from toxic forever chemicals.”
New Mexico is the third state to enshrine a ban in state laws to address the use of PFAS in consumer products, joining Maine and Minnesota.
As detailed in a news release from the environment, the law phases out and then prohibits consumer products that contain  intentionally added PFAS, which “can cause a range of adverse health issues including thyroid disease, liver or kidney damage, birth defects, certain types of cancers, and increase the risk of reproductive issues like decreased fertility, low birth weight, or developmental delays.”
Specifically, state law prohibits in 2027  the sale of certain products with intentionally added PFAS in items like cookware food packaging and juvenile products; cosmetics, furniture and carpets will be prohibited in 2028; and, in 2032, state law prohibits selling all non-exempt products —such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, electronics and cars— with intentionally added PFAS in New Mexico.
On Wednesday, the environment department submitted the rules to the independent Environmental Improvement Board. If passed after the rulemaking process they will take effect in July of 2026. Public comments have already been opened, and the state environment department will host a virtual public meeting on Oct. 22 to provide an overview of the rules and answer questions.
“With the passage of House Bill 212, we had one clear objective – to safeguard New Mexicans from dangerous added toxins, PFAS, in everyday products,” State Rep. and Majority Whip Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque) said in a statement. “Today’s Environmental Improvement Board filing brings us one critical step closer in removing harmful chemicals from our homes, and to provide peace of mind to our communities.”
The act also requires manufacturers to label products that include intentionally added PFAS. The environment department included two examples in a news release, but said neither are final.
“House Bill 212 represents an important step forward to protect New Mexicans from toxic PFAS chemicals,” state Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) said in a statement. “Data has shown that these dangerous cancer-causing chemicals persist in the human body and in the environment for a very long time, and we must do all we can to prevent New Mexican’s exposure to them.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Draft-PFAS-Label-2-1024x445.jpg,,,2025-10-09 12:58:44.330332

Vermont State Police are investigating a suspicious death at a home in the Franklin County town of Sheldon. 
The incident began early Tuesday morning when first responders were called to a Bedard Road home for a report of an unresponsive man, state police said in a press release. 
Police said the man, later identified as 55-year-old Matthew Turner, was pronounced dead at the scene. Turner’s body was taken to the Vermont Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington for an autopsy, which took place Wednesday, the release stated.
“Cause and manner of death remain pending, but the medical examiner notified VSP that the death appears suspicious,” according to the release. 
State police did not say why they believe Turner’s death appears suspicious. No other information was immediately available.
The state police major crime unit as well as divisions of the state police are investigating Turner’s death, the release stated.

(via Twitter).In places like Michigan, Connecticut, and Arizona this year, state attorneys generals have intervened  to challenge rate hikes proposed by public electricity utilities.
That’s not the case in Florida, despite the fact that Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest investor-owned utility, is going before state regulators this week requesting rate hikes of nearly $10 billion over the next four years.
“We need an attorney general who’s going to serve the people and not just be a puppet of the powerful,” says former state Senator José Javier Rodriguez. The Miami Democrat is running to be his party’s nominee next year against Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who has not appeared near the Public Service Commission (PSC) this week as FPL’s case goes before the regulatory agency.
Previous Florida Republican attorneys general such as Bill McCollum and Charlie Crist have intervened to oppose rate hikes proposed by Florida’s investor-owned utilities.
“The issue I have is that the attorney general is the people’s lawyer,” Rodriguez told the Phoenix in a phone interview Wednesday. “Attorney General Uthmeier is the least independent and most corrupt attorney general, in a string of corrupt attorney generals. He’s doing the exact opposite of what the job is.”
Earlier in the day, Rodriguez had attended a portion of Day Three of the PSC hearings in Tallahassee. He said if he already were attorney general, he’d be focusing on stopping FPL and how he could make people’s lives better — something he said Uthmeier isn’t doing.
“Go after the insurance companies that are keeping costs high,” he said. “Tackle these rate hikes that never end. Focus on threats to our children. The opioid crisis. Emerging threats online. That’s what people need. Instead, what he spends his time doing is figuring out how he can serve his powerful friends and how he can attract attention. That seems to be all that he is doing.”
Uthmeier has served as Florida’s attorney general since February, when Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to replace former AG Ashley Moody, whom he’d appointed to the U.S. Senate. Donald Trump endorsed him in what will be his first campaign next year.
In his social media posting, Trump hailed Uthmeier as “a true champion for ‘MAGA,’ and “THE MAN behind ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ.”
Referring to the immigrant detention center built in the Everglades,  Rodriguez argues that “enforcing the border is absolutely our job, but we can’t run roughshod over the other things that make us Americans.” He called the facility “overreach by detaining and deporting without due process, and it’s frankly not what people voted for, right?”
A poll published last week by The New York Times and Siena University shows that registered voters largely support the idea of removing immigrants who have arrived in the country illegally, even though majorities say Trump’s methods have gone too far.
The survey found that 54% favor deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. It also showed that 51% think the government was deporting mostly people who “should be deported” while 42% said the government was deporting the wrong people.
‘Corrupt cabal’
Rodriguez says he’s not deterred by how much the state has shifted red since he left office as a Miami-Dade County state legislator in 2020. Then again, there hasn’t been a Democratic attorney general in Florida since Bob Butterworth was forced to leave the office in 2002 because of term limits.
He says he’s running on a nonpartisan campaign platform concentrating on crime, costs, and corruption.
“My entire career trajectory has been looking out for the little guy who’s getting screwed and getting taken advantage of. That’s what I will do for Floridians to keep our kids safe, to look after taxpayers, to help bring some relief from never-ending costs that go up, and that’s what I’ll continue to do,” he said.
“That’s what Floridians deserve and, honestly, it’s also good politics. None of what I’m talking about is partisan. And I think all Floridians would welcome returning the attorney general’s office to the people and not continuing to have it in the hands of a corrupt cabal in Tallahassee.”
Rodriguez raised $143,000 in June, his first month of being a candidate in the race (POLITICO is reporting that he raised nearly $443,000 in the third quarter). Uthmeier has raised $614,000 in his regular campaign account and more than $2 million in his political committee.

That’s according to a public opinion survey conducted by the Tyson Group, led by Tallahassee pollster Ryan Tyson.
Congressional Democrats are holding up government funding to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have reduced premiums but are scheduled to expire on Dec. 31. Republicans have said they are open to talks about extending those premiums, but only after the Democrats vote to continue government operations until late November.
The Tyson Group’s survey of 800 likely general election Florida voters shows Moody with a seven percentage-point lead over Jennifer Jenkins, the top Democrat who has filed to challenge her next year. Moody leads, 44%-37%, with 19% of the sample unsure.
However, Moody’s 44% support is “significantly less” than the 57% of Florida voters who say they would be more likely to vote for her if she supports extending the premium tax credits. It’s also less than the 53% of Florida voters who say that they would be less likely to vote for her if she allows those tax credits to expire.
The poll shows 73% of all Floridians support extending the tax credits, including 60% of Republicans.
Extending the credits “would be a surefire way for Moody to score a win with Florida voters,” Tyson writes, adding that it could help introduce her to the general electorate, as only 53%  in the survey reported having an informed opinion about her and the job she is doing.
Moody was elected statewide twice as attorney general in 2018 and 2022. Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed her in January to succeed Marco Rubio, appointed by Donald Trump to serve as U.S. Secretary of State.
The survey was conducted Oct. 1-3.

Harrison, executive director of New Mexico Health Resources, Inc., speaks to lawmakers on the interim Health and Human Services Committee on Tuesday, Oct. 7, at the UNM Cancer Center in Albuquerque. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Reassessing New Mexico’s loan repayment programs for health workers could improve the state’s competitiveness in recruiting physicians, experts report.
According to a 2024 report by Think New Mexico, the state is facing a shortage of nearly 900 primary care physicians, physician assistants, psychiatrists, dentists and OB-GYNs. New Mexico Health Resources is working to find staff for 864 open positions at hospitals, private practices, community health centers and other healthcare employers throughout the state. The nonprofit has a contract with the New Mexico Department of Health to recruit providers through the National Health Service Corps in particular.
“The number of vacancies has risen in the last three years, particularly on the behavioral health side of things,” Jerry Harrison, executive director of New Mexico Health Resources, told members of the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee earlier this week. “There has been increasing demand for nurse practitioners, with a spread becoming larger in the specialty arena for nurse practitioners.”
NMSU nursing students being trained to fill New Mexico’s health care gaps

Harrison added that newly qualified practitioners are looking for more flexibility in potential jobs, higher salaries and better loan repayment programs.
“I think in order to reach the goal, and our goal is to fill as many vacant positions with high-quality candidates as we can, that we also have to pay attention not only to the vacancies, we have to also pay attention to what people who are looking for work are telling us,” Harrison said.  
According to a presentation by Legislative Finance Committee Fiscal Analyst Harry Rommel, New Mexico’s Health Professional Loan Repayment Program, which is overseen by the state’s Higher Education Department, may need to be updated to remain competitive and appeal to physicians. The program currently awards qualifying applicants a maximum of $75,000 in exchange for a three-year service commitment practicing in an area of the state designated a medical shortage area. The average loan debt for physicians is around $200,000, Rommel said.
“State appropriations have increased substantially for health professional loan repayment,” Rommel told the committee. “It is not yet clear if those investments are really leading to enhanced retention, especially in rural areas. We may need to adapt our state Health Professional Loan Repayment Program to be competitive, to remain competitive with those other states and those other federal programs.”
Rommel’s presentation highlighted that a majority of loan repayment awards were given to practitioners in Valencia County. He also pointed out that Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas offer larger loan repayment awards than New Mexico, making them more competitive in the region. 
Sen. Martin Hickey (D-Albuquerque), a retired physician, said New Mexico’s program is “not that eye-catching,” and reminded his fellow committee members that the need for medical workers in the state is only projected to increase as the Baby Boom generation, which includes himself, continues to age and require more care.
“We are going to, and are, hitting the system all across the country in ways that there is not nearly adequate supply anywhere nationally. And so, we have to compete on a national basis,” Hickey said. He suggested increasing the award amount, particularly for physicians who agree to practice in rural areas, and continuing to assess gradual increases year-to-year.
“If we did that for 50 people, 50 physicians a year, and gradually rolled that up over the years, it’d be about a $60 million a year hit to New Mexico,” he said. “But 50 new clinicians a year, coming from out of state, not just in state, anywhere, would really impact the huge shortage that we have for all the reasons we’ve discussed today.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2458-scaled-e1759938477171-1024x757.jpg,,,2025-10-09 12:00:52.158075

Data from the state’s corrections division — shared Tuesday with state lawmakers — showed Northern Regional Jail in Moundsville had 388 inmates, though the facility has the capacity for 289.
South Central Region Jail in Charleston had 516 inmates with a maximum capacity for 460. Eastern Regional Jail in Martinsburg has 478 inmates with an intended capacity for 448. 
The jails are holding immigrants detained from around the country due to the state’s contract with the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement during President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign. ICE pays West Virginia $90 for each day it holds a detainee. 
The West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation has made 48 beds available to ICE. The state had 75 immigrant detainees in its jails as of Wednesday, according to corrections officials. 
“WV DCR facilities operate at varying population levels, and from time to time, we adapt housing arrangements to meet demand while maintaining full compliance with state and federal health and safety standards,” DCR Commissioner David Kelly said in an email.
Not all ICE detainees are from West Virginia. A spokesperson for DCR said they could end up in West Virginia jails “due to the way people flow through the correctional system, and how and where they are apprehended.”
The immigrant detainee may have been placed in custody by ICE for possible deportation or an individual may have been transferred from another state pending transport to another location or deportation. The detainee may complete a sentence in a federal institution and is being held pending transfer.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who ordered state police and corrections officials to support Trump’s immigration policies, did not return a request for comment about the overcrowding issue. 
Kelly appeared before some lawmakers earlier this week at the state Capitol, discussing ongoing issues with jails overcrowding. The system is more than 600 inmates over capacity.
North Central Regional Jail is more than 46% over capacity, prompting concerns about whether the state needs to build a new correctional facility. The jail, located in Doddridge County, currently houses 825 inmates — 261 more than its capacity of 564.

“I think the primary concern is when you have jails that are filled to capacity or over capacity, how can we provide adequate services? I am also concerned about safety when you are stacking individuals in that environment,” he said Wednesday when reached by phone. 
In the last decade, West Virginia’s jails were the deadliest in the country. Overcrowding problems have persisted for years along with ongoing staffing shortages.
Hollis also noted that ICE detainees are federal inmates and under a different jurisdiction than state inmates. “These inmates are still in limbo about their specific rights,” he said.
From June 2024 to July of this year, the state billed ICE for a total of $339,615 for holding immigrant detainees in its custody, according to DCR.

The document, circulated on Capitol Hill, was first reported by The Detroit News and reportedly includes more than $800 million in Michigan projects. Other Michigan-based recipients on the list include Ford Motor Company and Dow Chemical Company.
The proposed cancellations come after Trump administration officials last week defended the decision to cancel federal projects in regions of the country that have voted for Democrats, insisting it was in an effort to reduce the size and scope of government during the ongoing shutdown of the federal government. Democrats, however, said the cancellations further eroded Congress’ constitutional authority over spending by unilaterally canceling funding that lawmakers approved on a bipartisan basis.
The U.S. Dept. of Energy said they are unable to verify the lists they’ve seen so far in the press. 
“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Press Secretary & Chief Spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement emailed to Michigan Advance. “As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration. Rest assured, the Department is hard at work to deliver on President Trump’s promise to restore affordable, reliable, and secure energy to the American people.”
The GM grant in Lansing has become a political flashpoint in Michigan. The plant currently builds Cadillac CT4 and CT5 sedans and previously assembled the Chevrolet Camaro. In awarding the grant, the Biden administration said transitioning the plant to EV production would preserve 650 jobs and create 50 new positions.

U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), whose district includes the plant, said he’s in contact with both GM and the administration. 
“While no final decision has been made, my top priority will always be standing with the auto workers and ensuring tax dollars are spent effectively as we unwind the Biden EV mandates that tied the hands of our auto industry and stifled our manufacturing economy,” he said in a statement emailed to the Advance.
That sentiment is in line with other Republicans who have criticized the grants as benefiting foreign industries. At an October 2024 campaign event, then-vice presidential nominee JD Vance warned the money could help China’s auto sector. 
 “[W]hen we write massive checks on American taxpayer expense to these companies, a lot of times what we’re doing is selling American middle class jobs to the Communist Chinese, and we ought to be doing exactly the opposite,” Vance said.
 GOP Senate candidate Mike Rogers also railed against the GM grant while campaigning last year against Democrat Elissa Slotkin.
 “I think if the federal government’s going to spend money they ought to spend on something that builds, something that people want to buy,” Rogers said following a 2024 debate with Slotkin.
 Slotkin, who defeated Rogers last November, slammed the proposal to cancel the grant. 
 “President Trump is now targeting Michigan workers,” Slotkin said in a statement to the Detroit News. “This $500 million investment would support union jobs and our manufacturing future. Canceling it plays right into China’s hands.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A judge has upheld a North Dakota law that bans gender-affirming care for minors. 
South Central District Court Judge Jackson Lofgren wrote in a Thursday order that the 2023 law that makes it a crime to prescribe puberty blockers and other treatments to adolescents does not violate the state constitution. 
Lofgren presided over a seven-day court trial in February that included testimony from doctors and transgender teens and their parents.
In his 85-page order, Lofgren writes that there is “legitimate ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness” of prescribing gender-affirming treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy to a minor. He adds that the evidence at trial shows a valid concern about whether adolescents have the capacity to understand the long-term risks of the medications.
“Where there is uncertainty, deference is given to the Legislature to decide where the line should be drawn,” Lofgren wrote.
The lawsuit was brought by North Dakota pediatric endocrinologist Luis Casas, who alleged that the ban is an unconstitutional infringement of personal autonomy and equal protection rights. 
Witnesses for the plaintiffs said there is consensus among leading medical associations that hormone therapy is safe and effective to treat gender dysphoria. 
Initially the plaintiffs also included three families who also challenged the state law. Lofgren limited the scope of the lawsuit, however, finding that the families could not sue because their children received gender-affirming before the ban took effect and fell under an exemption in the law.
In Lofgren’s ruling this week, he also affirms the health care exemption for families receiving the treatments in North Dakota prior to April 2023, when the law was signed.

When MDU filed its application for an increase in spring 2024, the average residential customer paid $44.61 a month, according to data from the PSC.
The nearly 36% increase reflects an additional $5.29 a month approved by the PSC and additional costs in natural gas itself for $10.64, according to figures provided by the PSC.
In an email, an MDU spokesperson noted gas costs are updated monthly.
Tuesday, the Public Service Commission unanimously approved on a 4-0 vote a settlement negotiated between MDU and the Montana Consumer Counsel for the natural gas rate increase.
PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder was absent.
MDU provides natural gas service to 88,900 customers in Montana, and its customer base is 88% residential, according to the draft PSC order.
In July 2024, MDU filed an application asking for an annual revenue increase of $9.4 million based on its investments in distribution and safety improvements, along with other factors, according to a staff report.
But the Consumer Counsel intervened and said it would support an increase of just $5.4 million.
In January 2025, the PSC authorized an increase of $7.7 million on a temporary basis.
That order took customer bills to $60.26, including $10.21 in “passthrough” gas costs over which commissioners have little discretion, an analyst said.
The stipulation the PSC approved Tuesday set the revenue increase for MDU at $7.3 million. The order said MDU will calculate any refunds owed from the lower revenue increase and pay them back over the next five months.
At the meeting, rate analyst Neil Templeton said the settlement doesn’t reflect what MDU or what the Montana Consumer Counsel wanted, but it landed somewhere in the middle.
In an assessment to commissioners, Templeton said the residential class “came out very well” based on the Consumer Counsel’s advocacy.
The order the PSC approved said the Consumer Counsel only contested the proposed rates for residential customers.
It said the Consumer Counsel did so on the basis the changes “would result in rate shock” and lead to a “fixed charge” that was the highest in Montana — a fixed charge is a flat rate for costs that aren’t variable.
At a meeting, Commissioner Randy Pinocci said his district has the lowest wages in Montana, so when rates are slated to increase, he gets questions.
“My retired senior citizens would like a rate class of their own,” Pinocci said. “Is there any state that has a rate class for retired people who have a fixed income?”
Templeton said he wasn’t aware of such a distinction, although he appreciated the sentiment.
He said the way the PSC tries to help is through supporting programs that are directed at people who have income constraints.
In response to Pinocci’s question about constituent concerns, Templeton said industry analysts typically consider the class of residential customers as underpaying, so residential payers also see proportionally higher increases.
He said Pinocci should remind customers that the cost of everything is increasing, even for utilities, and the PSC is legally obliged to allow a utility the opportunity to recover “prudently incurred costs.”
“I don’t want to say just suck it up. But sometimes, it’s a hard world, and it’s not all golden,” Templeton said. “And we do have increases, and we have to bear them.”
He said that wouldn’t be the case if the utility was trying to “gold-plate” infrastructure.
Commissioner Jeff Welborn wanted to confirm the way the increase was structured would benefit customers who use less energy — the order authorized a smaller increase for an upfront cost, and then a larger increase for the delivery of energy.
Templeton said the PSC had traditionally opted for a lower “buy in” charge and a higher charge for use — “like the cover charge at a bar and then a higher charge for your drinks.”
He said the idea behind that approach is it is expected to help protect lower income people, who tend to have smaller houses, and it also rewards efforts to conserve energy.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-185255376-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-09 12:00:52.158075

Shouldn’t a state be able to prohibit such a thing?
Yes, of course.
That striking example was offered in a case out of Colorado that was argued this week at the U.S. Supreme Court by a lawyer who tried to establish when a government can properly regulate speech in a mental health setting. He was trying to draw a contrast with a Colorado law, which he wants to scrap, that bans the practice of conversion therapy for minors.
But the example had the unintended effect of affirming the basic purpose of Colorado’s law: protecting children.
The conservative majority on the court, and even at least one liberal justice, appeared to think Colorado’s law gets crosswise with the First Amendment’s right to free speech. But if they strike down the state law, they will give mental health professionals in Colorado a license to harm.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Colorado’s Minor Conversion Therapy Law, adopted in 2019, bans mental health professionals licensed by the state from practicing conversion therapy with clients under 18. Conversion therapy involves attempts to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. The law was premised on a large body of medical evidence that shows conversion therapy not only doesn’t work but can hurt people.
Among the professional organizations that reject the practice are the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
But a licensed counselor in Colorado Springs isn’t having it. Kaley Chiles believes the Bible should take precedence in her clinic, and she insists on being able to counsel clients to live “consistently with God’s design, including their biological sex,” as she put it in her petition to the Supreme Court.
In 2022, Chiles initiated a lawsuit in federal court claiming Colorado’s anti-conversion therapy law is unconstitutional. After the district court and appeals court in Denver rejected her argument, she took the case to the Supreme Court. About 25 states have anti-conversion therapy laws similar to Colorado’s. An adverse ruling could invalidate regulations across the country.
A question at the heart of the case is whether the talk therapy Chiles practices should be treated fundamentally as protected speech or as conduct that only incidentally involves speech. If it’s fundamentally speech, the First Amendment prevails. If it’s conduct that incidentally involves speech, Colorado’s law stands.
The federal appeals court examined this question at length and concluded that whether or not the treatment Chiles provides consists of speech alone it’s still treatment, which the state has a strong interest in regulating, just like it regulates other medical practices. It highlighted that the “difference between skilled and inept talk therapy — no less than that between deft and botched surgery — can, in some cases, mean the difference between life and death.”
And it pointed out that Chiles’ protected speech remains intact, since she is free to discuss with clients what conversion therapy is, what her views about it are, and who can legally provide it, such as a life coach or faith leader. The law “only bars a mental health professional from engaging in the practice herself.” It’s therefore “a regulation of professional conduct incidentally involving speech.”
The plain logic of this finding seemed beyond the grasp of the justices of the Supreme Court, and they appear poised to rule against Colorado.
That would leave an untold number of young people in the state vulnerable to irresponsible or unethical practitioners who, under the authority of a state license, choose to dispense critical mental health treatment according to some interpretation of scripture rather than evidence-based standards of care.
State Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, one of the sponsors of the bill that became the Minor Conversion Therapy Law, understands the stakes as well as anyone.
“While writing the bill and fighting for its passage, my co-sponsors and I had meetings with parents, children, child psychology experts, and doctors,” she said in a statement Wednesday, a day after the Supreme Court heard oral arguments. “We heard gut-wrenching personal testimony, research and data about the lifelong consequences of conversion therapy, and even stories of suicide.”
Shouldn’t a state be able to prohibit such a thing?

In prior years, the State Department has contracted with IRIS (through its national affiliate, Church World Service) to assist refugees coming to the United States over the course of the first 90 days of their move.
Last year, starting on Oct. 1, IRIS was initially under contract to resettle 800 families. On Jan. 27, however, the Trump administration issued a “stop work order” halting the program after only 200 families had arrived.
Now, after an overhaul to U.S. refugee policy, IRIS has decided not to take on such a contract this year — and to focus instead on assisting refugees and immigrants who have already settled in Connecticut, or who have found private funding to arrive in the country on Special Immigrant Visas.
According to Executive Director Maggie Mitchell Salem, the federal 90-day resettlement assistance program has been moved from the State Department to the federal Health and Human Services department. In September, the department issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for agencies to help incoming refugees during their first 90 days.
Salem said that IRIS’ board met in mid-September and voted not to participate in the RFP.
She said that the decision was made after consultations with donors, volunteers, and community members.
The primary reason for the decision, she said, was President Donald Trump’s February executive order indicating an intent to allocating resettlement slots to white Afrikaners from South Africa ahead of over 130,000 already-approved refugees from other countries who have waited for years to enter the United States.
The decision was “not about political ideology,” but a “very pragmatic, operational, tied-to-our-mission decision on who we are here to serve and how we do that,” said Mitchell Salem. “We’re not a relocation company. We resettle the world’s most vulnerable people.”
Trump has recently championed the narrative that white Afrikaners (descendants of Dutch and French colonists in South Africa) are currently being persecuted by their government. He has claimed that vigilante attacks on South African farms amount to a “genocide” against white people; the South African government has countered that violence in the country does not statistically target white people. Trump’s executive order also lambasted post-apartheid reforms, including affirmative action laws and new legislation enabling uncompensated expropriation of land in certain circumstances.
Indeed, on Friday, the New York Times reported that Trump plans to overhaul the United States’ refugee program to focus largely on white Afrikaners. The Times reported that Trump also intends to cap the number of refugees accepted by the United States next year to 7,500 — a dramatic decrease from the most recent cap set by the Biden administration of 125,000. A majority of those slots, according to the Times, are slated to be reserved for Afrikaners.
According to an Oct. 4 press release from Church World Service, “No president other than Trump, regardless of party, has ever set a refugee admissions goal below 60,000. “
IRIS, which typically supports expanded immigration opportunities, is not taking the stance that those Afrikaners should not be accepted into the United States, noted Mitchell Salem. “We don’t judge people,” she said.
The reason that IRIS is not participating in resettlement this year is that “the word ‘refugee’ has meaning. It has an agreed upon definition,” Mitchell Salem said.
“The rule of law exists in South Africa. People have the opportunity to seek redress from their government,” while IRIS is focusing on serving people who have no other recourse in their countries of origin.
While Mitchell Salem said that IRIS community members and partners “overwhelmingly” advocated for the organization to not participate in resettlement this year, the decision was not an easy one.
It’s still uncertain how many refugees who have already met U.S. screening requirements could be allowed into the United States this year. “What does it mean to be saying no, when we could be saying no to populations that need safety?” asked Mitchell Salem.
Additionally, she said, “there’s risk of retaliation. We have other federal funding we are continuing to implement for those populations that are already here and their needs are significant.”
For now, IRIS is refocusing on assisting refugees who are already in New Haven with ongoing needs, including healthcare access, language learning, literacy, housing, and food security.
The organization has also been assisting Afghan individuals and families who worked with the U.S. Army and now face risk of retribution from the Taliban. Many of those individuals have already obtained Special Immigrant Visas allowing them to come to the U.S. and simply need the money to afford traveling here in the absence of federal funding.
Some have been able to secure private funding, such as travel loans, according to Mitchell Salem. On average, IRIS has helped one Afghan family settle in the U.S. each month since February, drawing from private donations as well as some state funding to keep resettlement efforts alive.

Now they run US Education Dept.,Megan O'Matz and Jennifer Smith Richards | ProPublica,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/09/linda-mcmahon-dismantle-public-schools/,Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been clear about her desire to shut down the agency she runs. She calls it 'the final mission.',"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been clear about her desire to shut down the agency she runs. She’s laid off half the staff and joked about padlocking the door.She calls it “the final mission.”But the department is not behaving like an agency that is simply winding down. Even as McMahon has shrunk the Department of Education, she’s operated in what she calls “a parallel universe” to radically shift how children will learn for years to come. The department’s actions and policies reflect a disdain for public schools and a desire to dismantle that system in favor of a range of other options — private, Christian and virtual schools or homeschooling.Over just eight months, department officials have opened a $500 million tap for charter schools, a huge outlay for an option that often draws children from traditional public schools. They have repeatedly urged states to spend federal money for poor and at-risk students at private schools and businesses. And they have threatened penalties for public schools that offer programs to address historic inequities for Black or Hispanic students.McMahon has described her agency moving “at lightning rocket speed,” and the department’s actions in just one week in September reflect that urgency.The agency publicly blasted four school districts it views as insubordinate for refusing to adopt anti-trans policies and for not eliminating special programs for Black students. It created a pot of funding dedicated to what it calls “patriotic education,” which has been criticized for downplaying some of the country’s most troubling episodes, including slavery. And it formed a coalition with Turning Point USA, Hillsdale College, PragerU and dozens of other conservative groups to disseminate patriotic programming.Officials at the Education Department declined to comment or answer questions from ProPublica for this story.At times, McMahon has voiced support for public schools. But more often and more emphatically she has portrayed public schools as unsuccessful and unsafe — and has said she is determined to give parents other options.To carry out her vision, McMahon has brought on at least 20 political appointees from ultraconservative think tanks and advocacy groups eager to de-emphasize public schools, which have educated students for roughly 200 years.Among them is top adviser Lindsey Burke, a longtime policy director at The Heritage Foundation and the lead author of the education section in Project 2025’s controversial agenda for the Trump administration.In analyzing dozens of hours of audio and video footage of public and private speaking events for McMahon’s appointees, as well as their writings, ProPublica found that a recurring theme is the desire to enable more families to leave public schools. This includes expanding programs that provide payment — in the form of debit cards, which Burke has likened to an “Amazon gift card” — to parents to cobble together customized educational plans for their children. Instead of relying on public schools, parents would use their allotted tax dollars on a range of costs: private school tuition, online learning, tutors, transportation and music lessons.More than 8 in 10 elementary and secondary students in the U.S. go to a traditional public school. But Burke expects that public schools will see dramatic enrollment declines fueled by both demographic and policy changes.Addressing an interviewer in an April podcast, she noted: “We’re going to have a lot of empty school buildings.”In a 2024 podcast, Noah Pollak, now a senior adviser in the Education Department, bemoaned what he sees as progressive control of schools, which he said has led to lessons he finds unacceptable, such as teaching fourth graders about systemic racism.“And so the work that I do is trying to come up with creative policy ideas to stop that, to turn back the tide, to figure out ways that conservatives can protect these institutions or build new institutions,” said Pollak, who has been an adviser to conservative groups.As tax dollars are reallocated from public school districts and families abandon those schools to learn at home or in private settings, the new department officials see little need for oversight. Instead, they would let the marketplace determine what’s working using tools such as Yelp-like reviews from parents. Burke has said she is against “any sort of regulation.”President Donald Trump himself said in July that the federal government needs only to provide “a little tiny bit of supervision but very little, almost nothing,” over the nation’s education system except to make sure students speak English.Advocates for public schools consider them fundamental to American democracy. Providing public schools is a requirement in every state constitution.Families in small and rural communities tend to rely more heavily on public education. They are less likely than families in cities to have private and charter schools nearby. And unlike private schools, public school districts don’t charge tuition. Public schools enroll local students regardless of academic or physical ability, race, gender or family income; private schools can selectively admit students.Karma Quick-Panwala, a leader at the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, which advocates for disabled students, said she wants to be optimistic. “But,” she added, “I’m very fearful that we are headed towards a less inclusive, less diverse and more segregated public school setting.”Allison Rose Socol, a policy expert at EdTrust, an organization focusing on civil rights in schools, decried what she called the “demo crew” in McMahon’s office. Socol described McMahon’s push to help grow private school enrollment through taxpayer-funded vouchers and other means as a “great American heist” that will funnel money away from the public system.“It’s a strategic theft of the future of our country, our kids and our democracy,” she said.Attention on McMahon often focuses on her former role as CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment. It was no different on the day of her Senate confirmation hearing, when journalists and social media delighted in noting that seated behind her was her son-in-law, the retired wrestler known as Triple H.Little attention was paid to the conservative education activists in the front row from Moms for Liberty, which has protested school curricula and orchestrated book bans nationwide; Defending Education (formerly Parents Defending Education), which has sued districts to fight what it calls liberal indoctrination; and the America First Policy Institute, co-founded by McMahon after the first Trump administration.Now two people who once served at Defending Education have been named to posts in the Education Department, and leaders from Moms for Liberty have joined McMahon for roundtables and other official events. In addition, at least nine people from the America First Policy Institute have been hired in the department.AFPI’s sweeping education priorities include advocating for school vouchers and embedding biblical principles in schools. It released a policy paper in 2023, titled “Biblical Foundations,” that sets out the organization’s objective to end the separation of church and state and “plant Jesus in every space.”The paper rejects the idea that society has a collective responsibility to educate all children equally and argues that “the Bible makes it clear that it is parents alone who shoulder the responsibility for their children.” It frames public schooling as failing, with low test scores and “far-left social experiments, such as gender fluidity.”The first AFPI leader pictured in that report is McMahon.AFPI and the other two nonprofit groups sprang up only after the 2020 election. Together they drew in tens of millions of dollars through a well-coordinated right-wing network that had spent decades advocating for school choice and injecting Christianity into schools.Ultrawealthy supporters include right-wing billionaire Richard Uihlein, who, through a super PAC, gave $336,000 to Moms for Liberty’s super PAC from October 2023 through July 2024.Defending Education and AFPI received backing from some of the same prominent conservative foundations and trusts, including ones linked to libertarian-minded billionaire Charles Koch and to conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, an architect of the effort to strip liberal influence from the courts, politics and schools.Maurice T. Cunningham, a now-retired associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts, studied the origins and connections of parents’ rights groups, finding in 2023 that the funders — a small set of billionaires and Christian nationalists — had similar goals.The groups want “to undermine teachers unions, protect their wealthy donors from having to contribute their fair share in taxes to strengthen public schools, and provide profit opportunities through school privatization,” he concluded. The groups say they are merely trying to advocate for parents and for school choice. They didn’t discuss their relationship with donors when contacted by ProPublica.These groups and their supporters now have access to the top levers of government, either through official roles in the agency or through the administration’s adoption of their views.When the department created an “End DEI” portal to collect tips about diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in schools, it quoted Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice in the press release. She encouraged parents to “share the receipts of the betrayal that has happened in our public schools.” Moms for Liberty referred to the portal as the “culmination” of Justice’s work. (Federal judges ruled against some of the administration’s anti-DEI actions and the department took the controversial portal down in May.)Asked what percentage of children she imagines should be in public schools going forward, Justice, who is now with The Heritage Foundation’s political advocacy arm, told ProPublica: “I hope zero. I hope to get to zero.”She and others say most public schools don’t teach students to read, are dividing children over race and are secretly helping students to change genders — familiar claims that have been widely challenged by educators.When Trump signed an executive order in March to dismantle the Education Department, Justice sat in the first row, as she had at McMahon’s confirmation hearing. The president praised her, along with various governors and lawmakers. “She’s been a hard worker,” he said.Defending Education’s Nicole Neily, who was also at McMahon’s confirmation, stood next to McMahon when the secretary announced an investigation into the Maine Department of Education for keeping records from parents about student gender identity plans. Defending Education has filed civil rights complaints against colleges and school districts and has been successful in having its causes taken up by the Trump administration.In an email, Neily told ProPublica she is proud of the work that Defending Education has done to challenge schools that have supported DEI in their curricula and have allowed students to hide their gender identity from parents. She singled out teacher unions and “radical education activists” while blaming drops in student achievement on “the education-industrial complex.”“The sooner this stranglehold is broken, the better,” she wrote. McMahon’s tenure also has been marked by an embrace of religion in schools. She signaled that priority when she appointed Meg Kilgannon to a top post in her office.Kilgannon had worked in the department as director of a faith initiative during the first Trump term and once was part of the Family Research Council, an evangelical think tank that opposes abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.She has encouraged conservative Christians to become involved in what she’s described as “a spiritual war” over children and what they’re being taught in public schools.Reached by phone, Kilgannon told ProPublica, “I have no comment,” and hung up.Betsy DeVos, the Michigan billionaire who was education secretary in Trump’s first term, cheered on July 4 this year when Congress instituted America’s first federal voucher program. It came in the form of a generous tax credit program to encourage voucher expansion at the state level. Families can start accessing the aid beginning Jan. 1, 2027.DeVos once said she wanted “to advance God’s kingdom” through vouchers for religious schools and has funneled vast amounts of her family fortune into advocating for school choice. She called the passage of the federal measure “the turning point in ending the one-size-fits-all government school monopoly.”An article in The Federalist, a conservative publication, boiled down the implications into one headline: “How Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill Will Help Kids Escape Failing Government Schools.”But school choice isn’t the only tool that Trump’s education leaders are using to target public schools. McMahon has gutted the Education Department’s civil rights division, where lawyers and other federal employees work to ensure all students can access public school, free from discrimination.The administration rolled back protections for LGBTQ+ students and students of color, prioritized investigating discrimination against white and Jewish students, and launched aggressive investigations of states and districts that it says refused to stop accommodating transgender students.It has rescinded official guidance that said schools had to provide language help and other services for students who are learning English, contradicting long-established federal law.And Trump officials have repeatedly cast public schools as dangerous even as the agency canceled about $1 billion in training grants for more school mental health professionals — money that had been authorized by Congress to help prevent school shootings. The administration now says it plans to resume paying out a fraction of that funding, which would be used for school psychologists.Over and over, the department has used the threat of pulling federal funding to force compliance with new directives and rapid shifts in policy. The department, for instance, threatened to withhold money from schools that did not verify they were ending diversity initiatives, which were designed to address inequitable treatment of Black, Native and Latino students.In August, the department announced it was withholding millions of dollars in grants from five northern Virginia school districts that had refused the department’s demands to bar transgender students from using restrooms and locker rooms that aligned with their gender identity. The districts argued that complying would mean defying Virginia law and a 2020 federal appeals court ruling.Nevertheless, the Education Department told the districts that until they acquiesced to the agency’s bathroom rules they would have to pay expenses up front and request reimbursement. McMahon wrote to districts that “Lindsey Burke is available to answer any questions.”The Fairfax County Public Schools sued and in a legal filing said it faced losing $167 million this school year, money that it was relying on to provide meals to students, support programs for children with disabilities, help English-language learners and enhance teacher training. The federal department has argued that it has discretion to withhold funding and admonished the district for taking the agency to court.In this atmosphere, public school advocates are particularly concerned about what will happen to funding for Title I grants, which is the federal government’s largest program for schools and is aimed at helping students from low-income families. In early September, House Republicans proposed slashing more than $5 billion from the $18.4 billion earmarked for Title I, putting at risk reading and math teachers, tutors and classroom technology.At the same time, under McMahon, the Education Department is trying to redefine how states and districts can spend the money.In three guidance letters so far this year, the agency encouraged states to divert some Title I money away from public school districts. One suggested paying for outside services, such as privatized tutoring. Another urged states to use Title I money to benefit low-achieving students who live within the boundaries of a high-poverty public school but attend private schools.McMahon is prepared to loosen even more rules on the money. The federal dollars currently are distributed to districts using a formula. Project 2025 calls for Title I to be delivered to states as block grants, or chunks of money with few restrictions. McMahon has encouraged states to ask her to waive rules on spending the money.Critics of this approach fear that Title I money could eventually be used in ways that undermine public schools — on private school vouchers, for example.Public school advocates like William Phillis, a former official at the Ohio Department of Education, fear the change would devastate public schools.“I just know any block grant or any funding that would be left up to state officials on Title I money would be misappropriated in terms of the intent,” Phillis said. “Block grants to Ohio would go to the private sector.”A spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce did not respond to requests for comment.Rainey Briggs, chief of operations for Des Moines Public Schools in Iowa, said he supports parental choice but worries that public schools will suffer financially and will not have the resources to stay up to date.And he fears that right-wing narratives around public schools, the distrust and lack of support for highly trained district leaders — whether from some parents or politicians — could lead accomplished educators to walk away.“Public education is irreplaceable,” he said, citing its commitment to serve every child regardless of their background or circumstance. Those influencing Trump’s education agenda disagree.“If America’s public schools cease to exist tomorrow, America would be a better place,” Justice told ProPublica.Illustrations by Pete Gamlen.

(Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)OVERLAND PARK — Wednesday marked the first day in two years that transgender Kansans were able to change the gender markers on their drivers licenses after the Kansas Supreme Court denied Attorney General Kris Kobach’s appeal in a long legal battle.
For Jessie Lawson, her driver’s license was the last document to change. She updated her birth certificate before a federal judge halted modifications, and her Social Security card and passport before President Donald Trump’s executive order stated the federal government only recognizes two genders.

“Everything has been updated with the correct gender marker except for my driver’s license, which this guy won’t let us do,” Lawson said. “Republicans in Kansas are very intolerant of anything that’s not like them.”
Lawson didn’t have the proper paperwork to change her driver’s license before Kobach sued the Kansas Department of Revenue for allowing transgender Kansans to change their gender markers. He argued they weren’t complying with Senate Bill 180, which defined women by reproductive ability.
In 2023, Shawnee County District Judge Teresa Watson issued a temporary injunction blocking such changes. KDOR and the American Civil Liberties Union appealed, and the Kansas Court of Appeals overturned Watson’s injunction in June.
Kobach appealed the ruling, but the Kansas Supreme Court declined to hear the case last week.
“We look forward to KDOR resuming gender marker changes on driver’s licenses at the earliest possible time,” said Monica Bennett, legal director of the ACLU of Kansas, in a news release.
Lawson had an appointment at the Andover Department of Motor Vehicles for Monday, but was told the DMVs hadn’t been given the go-ahead. A KDOR spokesperson on Monday told Kansas Reflector the agency was waiting for signed paperwork from the court.
“This is so heart-wrenching,” Lawson said on Tuesday when there was no clear timeline. “These people have no idea what this means to us.”
That wasn’t the first time Lawson was told to wait — in June, she spent the morning at the DMV before being informed of Kobach’s plan to appeal.
“Every little victory is a breath of fresh air, and the fact that this is happening in Kansas is mind-boggling,” Lawson said. “I need to get on this right now because they’re going to pull that special session in November and they’re going to modify SB 180 to include blocking licenses for the rest of time.”
Statehouse Republicans are pushing for a special session in early November.
Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins originally pushed the special session to gerrymander U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids — the only Democratic, female, and Native American representative from Kansas — out of office.
But after the Kansas Supreme Court’s ruling, they’ve added a goal to amend SB 180 to bar transgender people from changing the gender markers on their drivers licenses.
“Attorney General Kobach has urgently requested that the Legislature call a special session to address an issue that he considers even more important than redistricting,” Masterson wrote in a letter.
In a statement, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly called Masterson’s letter “political theater.”
Brittany Jones, the president of Kansas Family Voice — a conservative Christian organization — supported Masterson and Hawkins’ quest for a special session.
“The highest court in our state should not allow the confusion of the age to cloud the clarity of our most basic public documents — like driver’s licenses,” Jones said in a news release.
Lawson is tentatively happy about the change. She’s worried that the special session will lead to KDOR adopting a policy similar to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment’s regulation in which birth certificates that have already been changed remain valid but any new copies “must reflect the sex assigned at birth.”
She’s also worried that a change to SB 180 would embolden anti-trans people.
“I take every win where I can get it,” Lawson said. “Everything you read in the news is always like they’re hammering on trans rights, they’re taking our rights away.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/4F5A8427-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-09 10:57:33.645511
,Mississippi Today,2025-10-09 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Online charter school wants to open in a Mississippi Delta town with sparse broadband access,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/09/online-charter-school-delta-broadband/,Archway Charter School has struggled to raise start-up funds and failed to demonstrate it has attracted faculty or students since its approval in 2024.,"BELZONI – When Archway Charter School was first proposed, it was described as providing “bridges to a brighter future.” It was later referred to as a “reprieve” from a slew of failing school districts in the Mississippi Delta. Archway students would engage with ancient texts in virtual reality and be immersed in a classical education that only students in more affluent zip codes could normally access.
The school was described as an opportunity for Belzoni, a community of 1,700 residents in Humphreys County in one of the poorest, most rural parts and least tech-accessible parts of the state.
Regulators, evaluators and others ask: Can a virtual school succeed there?
The county, where over a fifth of the residents live below the poverty level, ranks 61st in broadband access out of Mississippi’s 82 counties, according to research from Mississippi State University.
Belzoni – pronounced bel-ZONE-ah by locals – rises from fields of soybean, corn and cotton,  more than an hour’s drive northwest of Jackson.
The town first appears in gas station signs and a tall neon one off Highway 49 inviting travelers into “the heart of the Delta.” Ponds beside dirt and paved roads still produce the town’s famous commodity. Belzoni has called itself the “Catfish capital of the world” since 1976. 
Plans for Archway Charter School were first announced in spring 2024, with an initial proposal for grades seven to 12. However, the school has struggled to raise start-up funds since gaining state approval. Financial disclosures have also spelled recent trouble for the company contracted to provide the virtual learning component. 
These facts, including lack of internet access, concerned the state’s third-party evaluator when Archway first sought approval of its charter in October 2024
“I have seen a hybrid model that worked, but not in rural areas where there’s a high rate of poverty and families that may not have access to equipment or resources to be successful,” said Wanda Giulliaume, one of three independent evaluators who issued a recommendation to the board.
Archway Founder David Herndon responded by saying Archway would pay for internet access for students who need it, by potentially “diverting some funds” to get families access to quality internet. School officials would collect that information along with enrollment applications.
He said he is confident students will be able to connect to the internet after conversations with Southeast Cable and other broadband providers. 
But access issues still worry Mississippi Department of Education administrators and local legislators. 
Kym Wiggins, chief operating officer for the state Department of Education, expressed concerns after consulting surveys from districts about students’ access to equipment and broadband.
“There is an access issue,” Wiggins said. “So what do students do when they don’t have access? They do nothing. And they are going to a McDonald’s in a gas station. That’s not a viable option.”

Tiny communities such as Midnight, Louise and Putnam as well as homes along Highway 12 and Highway 7 lack adequate broadband access, said Rep. Timaka James-Jones, a Democrat from Belzoni.
By the end of the September 2024 Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board meeting, Archway had an approved charter with stipulations before it could open, such as proof of start-up funds.
Once it opens, Archway Charter School is expected to draw $488,817 from Humphreys County School District in the first year to cover some of the $1.4 million in operating costs.
Without a Charter School Program fund and only assumed sources of revenue on its most recently listed budget, Archway has not demonstrated how it will recruit high-quality teachers and finance its operation. Even before the school has opened, Herndon has asked the authorizer board to let Archway expand down to sixth grade. 
“As of today, the school does not have any funds available for operations,” board executive director Lisa Karmacharya wrote in an email Thursday to Mississippi Today. “The school will be required to submit an amended/updated budget to the authorizer (board) in December.”
Now Entering the Delta-verse
On a Friday afternoon in Belzoni, locals congregated on porches, pulled grills and invited friends to shuttered gas stations, leaning up against long-emptied gas pumps with plate lunches and cold beer. One street has shacks with wooden boards for windows and black plastic fluttering under loose roof shingles. Another has a junior high school that can only be glimpsed from behind a chain link fence. Restaurants where families would toast new graduates and fill up on grub in between football games are now vacant with yellowed, sunbeaten signs of the meals they once served. The town’s youngest residents still board yellow buses – and on Friday  nights in the fall, locals still root for the Humphreys County Cowboys. 
For Herndon, the Delta, and particularly Humphreys County, seemed fertile ground for a hybrid school. 
In the application to the Mississippi Charter Authorizer Board, Archway identified 14 Delta districts within a 1.5-hour drive of the future charter with “failing” middle schools. Mississippi law restricts charter schools to districts that earn a D or F on the state accountability system. Humphreys County School District has a D, but nine of the 14 Herndon listed are rated C.
“The vast majority of parents with rising sixth-graders in this district are forced to send their children from successful elementary schools to the district’s only middle school that is failing,” Herndon, the charter school’s executive director, told the board.

While nearly every Delta public school district sees a drop in test scores in middle school, the same phenomenon is true in school districts across the state, including in DeSoto County, Pearl and Pearl River County, among other districts that are labeled A or B in accountability ratings. Nearly a third of Delta region elementary schools received a D or F.
The plan is for Archway to be a hybrid school where each month, students log into virtual learning for 18 days and meet in person for two days for culture building and assessments. On virtual learning days, students will have live classes in the morning and self-paced coursework in the afternoon. On Fridays, students will complete self-paced online coursework all day.
Classes conducted in virtual reality will slowly be introduced to the curriculum as the school grows, Archway’s approved charter application says. The district plans to purchase VR headsets for students and staff.
Virtual charter schools have become more popular since the waning days of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many promising better outcomes for students on a more flexible schedule.
However, research from Stanford University found that online charter students saw less academic growth than their peers in traditional public schools, growing 58 fewer days in reading and 124 fewer in math per year.
Most of the elective courses are also contracted out to an online learning software called Edgenuity, which was investigated by the Los Angeles United School District’s inspector general for poor results for students. Hundreds of Plano, Texas, families pulled their kids from an online school that made use of the software because of its poor quality of instruction. A 2020 Mississippi Today story highlighted concerns by students and parents who couldn’t reach a teacher for help during online courses.
The Florida Connection
Herndon said he based his recent failed proposal to expand to sixth grade partly on recent analysis provided by OptimaEd, the Florida-based company contracted to provide the online education component of the Archway curriculum. 
OptimaEd provides “virtual reality educational experiences” to schools primarily in Florida.
In one example of virtual learning posted to the company’s account on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, Latin students at The Walker School in Florida walk in avatar form across a digital rendering of a Roman villa. In another post, students at another Florida school virtually traipse across the ocean floor to learn about biodiversity.
OptimaEd’s founder is Erika Donalds, a school choice advocate and the wife of U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican.
Adam Mangana, the company’s new CEO replacing Donalds, lives in Mississippi, according to Archway’s application. For the last four years, he’s held executive positions at the Naples, Florida-based company he helped co-found.
Mangana previously founded Midtown Public Charter School in Jackson, led a virtual reality lab at Jackson Prep in Flowood, and served as dean of students at St. Andrew’s School in Ridgeland and headed the Christian-centered St. Benedict School. 
Midtown Public Charter School has noticeably only received Ds or Fs in the state accountability rating since the 2017-2018 school year.
The application also mentioned that several other company employees were Mississippians whose “proximity” allowed for “a truly unique partnership to Archway as it opens and grows.”
A Florida Bulldog investigation documented the recent financial struggles of the education technology firm. While a previous year’s disclosure listed the company’s value between $1 million and $5 million, the company is now valued between $500,000 and $1 million. This coincides with it losing contracts with three Florida charter schools because of accounting errors.
For third-party evaluators, the “classical inspired” education offered by OptimaEd also didn’t clearly align with standards set by the Mississippi Department of Education.
“There is no evidence to support the effectiveness of classical education principles combined with the proposed curriculum,” wrote the third-party evaluators in their final recommendation.
Herndon is the former headmaster of Saint Augustine School, “a classical Christian school” in Ridgeland. 
Matthew Metcalf, the Archway school board president, serves as director of business and financial services for an Idaho-based company that helps found “classical Christian schools” across the country, according to his LinkedIn page. He also formerly led “classical academies” in both Alaska and Minnesota.
Classical Christian schools are private schools with curriculums informed by great works of Western literature and philosophy as well as the Bible. 
The hub-bub about the hub
Herndon plans to establish an in-person hub whereby students can go to join online classes should they be unable to connect to the internet. 
At the most recent board meeting in September, board chair Marcy Scoggins said it would defeat the purpose of a virtual school to depend on an in-person hub.

The hub would be at Archway’s physical address at Upper Room Fellowship Ministries, off U.S. 49 in Belzoni. Third-party evaluators said Archway overrepresented how much classroom space was available at the hub for students, pitching the idea of setting up classrooms in the gym, fellowship hall and auditorium. 
The Boys and Girls Club, which offers after-school programming to school-aged children, occupied the same site up until this past summer. The Humphreys County club expects to have a new location by January.
Despite outlining a goal to enroll 208 Delta students in Archway’s first year, school officials’ applications or compliance check-ins with the board did not include testimony from any local family planning to enroll a child. 
“It is not the best avenue for this rural area for our district, for our county,” Rep. James-Jones said. “It will definitely harm our public school system.”
During the last board meeting in September, two members appointed by Republican Gov. Tate Reeves – Tupelo pastor Jay Carney and Laurel attorney Ben Morgan – were the sole votes in favor of expanding the charter to include sixth grade.
“I think a little differently that we have some flexibility on the front end,” Morgan said. “I want us to be problem solvers, not problem creators.”
Archway is slated to open in August with the condition that it provides proof that it met 40% of its enrollment goal and that all enrolled students have internet access and an amended budget that demonstrates financial solvency.
James-Jones said she has not received a coherent plan guaranteeing her constituents would have access to Wi-Fi if they enrolled a student.
“I understand the focus of the school is education,” she said. “But you have to have the resources to do that.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/07182234/AP17083164755817.jpg,,,2025-10-09 10:57:33.645511

Those decisions are based on scientific analysis that could be compromised this year by the federal government shutdown. (Photo provided by the Natinoal Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)For the organization that oversees commercial fisheries in federal waters off Alaska, the most significant impact of the federal government shutdown might materialize in December.
That is when the North Pacific Fishery Management Council is scheduled to issue harvest limits for Alaska pollock – the nation’s top-volume commercial harvested species – and other types of groundfish harvested in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, such as Pacific cod and sablefish.
The Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska pollock harvests start in January.
To set the groundfish harvest levels, the council relies on federal scientists’ analysis of fish stocks in the ocean, work that is based in large part on scientific surveys conducted over the summer.
But during the shutdown, most National Marine Fisheries Service employees, including the scientists who analyze survey data to assess the conditions of commercially targeted fish stocks, are furloughed.
On Wednesday, the last day of the council’s October meeting, the members considered how to deal with scientific uncertainty if the government shutdown prevents completion of the detailed analysis that is usually provided in time for the December meeting.
Council member Nicole Kimball referred to a warning issued eight days prior by Bob Foy, director of the NMFS Alaska Fisheries Science Center, the organization that does the stock assessments. Foy said then that a shutdown lasting more than five days would compromise the ability to complete stock assessments and that a shutdown beyond 15 working days would “dramatically impact” those assessments.
The 15-day threshold is not too far away, Kimball said.
“How does the council and the public understand what to expect in December, in between the October and December meeting, relative to stock assessments?” she asked.
Diana Evans, the council’s deputy director, said impacts are yet to be determined, but the public will be notified of them as soon as possible.
“We don’t think we can answer that until we have a better sense of exactly where we land and how many days of work are remaining between the time that government workers are back and able to resume that work and the meeting,” she said.
Advocates with environmental organizations said they worry about shutdown effects on scientific information needed for harvest decisions, which would add to the effects of mass firings and retirements at NMFS and other agencies.
“I’m terrified at the prospect of flying blind into the next fishing season, especially as the Trump administration has decimated the ranks of scientists who monitor the health of our oceans,” Cooper Freeman, Alaska director of the Center for Biological DIversity, said by email. “I’m especially worried about fisheries like the massive pollock trawl fleet that has been harvesting millions of tons annually at the expense of the larger ecosystem.” 
“The first challenge with this shutdown is the instant level of uncertainty it creates. Normal processes face delays that can easily impact or inhibit active fisheries. Potential staff losses will exacerbate that,” Michelle Stratton, executive director of the Alaska Marine Conservation Council, said by email.
“But beyond the concern for continuing day to day services, are those major efforts — like stock assessments and (total allowable catch) setting — that rely on substantial NMFS staff input, data processing and expert analysis. If this continues to the point where we are unable to set catch limits for the start of the 2026 seasons, we’ll be in seriously uncharted territory, and could well see massive economic impacts to our fishing communities and fleets,” she said. 
The shutdown forced the council to rearrange its October meeting because federal representatives were unavailable to present information.
One major agenda item was postponed: review of a work plan for assessing essential fish habitat. Other items on the agenda were abbreviated.
The shutdown has already affected fishery management operations to some degree, said council member Jon Kurland. As Alaska regional director for NMFS, Kurland is one of a small group of agency employees remaining at work during the shutdown.
Kurland, in comments last week at the start of the meeting, said some services have been unavailable during the shutdown, such as the processing of harvest quota transfers.
NMFS is still doing basic management of ongoing fisheries, monitoring and closing them as needed, and is supported by contractors, he said. But that level of work has its limits, he said.
“If there are significant unforeseen problems, we will have limited ability to address those. Fingers crossed,” he said then.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PollockNOAApic.jpg,,,2025-10-09 10:57:33.645511

Brockman, 41, was charged with two counts of indecent liberties with a child and two counts of statutory rape of someone between the ages of 13 and 15, according to the Guilford County sheriff’s office.
He is being held without bond at the High Point Detention Center and is expected to appear in court on Thursday.
Brockman’s legislative assistant declined to comment.

Rep. Cecil Brockman (D-Guilford) has had a stormy relationship within his own party in recent months.
Last December, Brockman issued a strong rebuke to own party leadership, accusing Democrats of “attacking” him after being absent from a key veto override vote.
“I genuinely question the strategy of the Democratic establishment who prefer to scapegoat a member of their own party to shift the heat off themselves for an outcome they failed to change,” Brockman wrote at the time.
Brockman went on to issue a stark warning to his party ahead of the 2025 legislative session, in which Democrats held a one-seat margin against Republican veto overrides.
“For those in our party who desire to keep my name in their mouths, let me make it plain and clear for you: Over these next two years, you need me,” Brockman said. “I do not need you.”


Brockman, 41, was charged with two counts of indecent liberties with a child and two counts of statutory rape of someone between the ages of 13 and 15, according to the Guilford County sheriff’s office.
He is being held without bond at the High Point Detention Center and is expected to appear in court on Thursday.
A magistrate’s order denying bond to Brockman cites his role as a state representative with “abundant resources to aid in his flight from prosecution.” 
Brockman has made efforts to contact the victim, including using his status and “has gone as far as attempting to locate the juvenile in the hospital,” according to the order. 
The lawmaker’s legislative assistant declined to comment.
Democratic Gov. Josh Stein described the charges as “extremely serious and deeply troubling.”
“While the legal process has yet to play out, it’s clear he cannot effectively serve his constituents and should resign immediately,” Stein said in a statement. 
House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) initially issued a statement saying the charges, if true, would disqualify Brockman from public office.
When more information became available as the morning went on, Reives put out another statement.
“As we continue to learn more about the allegations against Rep. Brockman this morning, it has become clear that he is unable to continue serving in the House of Representatives. Rep. Brockman must resign immediately,” Reives said in his second statement.

The North Carolina Democratic Party also issued a statement asking Brockman to resign.
“The profound seriousness of these criminal charges makes it impossible for him to effectively represent his community,” the statement read.
Republicans like House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell, Watauga) and Majority Leader Brenden Jones (R-Columbus, Robeson) joined in on requests for Brockman’s resignation.
“The charges against Rep. Brockman are shocking and extremely serious,” Hall said in a statement. “Given the evidence that’s publicly known, he should resign immediately so these charges do not distract from the work of the North Carolina House.”
“This behavior is appalling and has no place in the General Assembly,” Jones posted on social media.

Mikie Sherrill (D) backs a bill that would ban phones from classrooms statewide. Jack Ciattarelli (R) wants local districts to decide. (StockPlanets/Getty Images)The two leading candidates in the race for governor both want to limit the distractions that cellphones create in school — but they have different plans to get there.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) this week said she supports a bill that would implement a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms, remarks she made as part of her campaign’s push to highlight the dangers of the digital world for children.
“I just think we should take cellphones out of classrooms. When you talk to educators, they are getting far more engagement from their classrooms without cellphones,” Sherrill said at an event at Kean University Monday.
Four weeks left in NJ’s rough-and-tumble race for governor

Sherrill said if elected governor on Nov. 4, she would create a social media research center, similar to the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers University, where researchers would look into age-appropriate screen times, what kind of content is helpful or harmful to kids, and more.
GOP candidate Jack Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, said he also wants to take cellphones out of students’ hands during class, but he opposes a state-mandated ban.
“Each district and the district’s parents should work together to work out what the specifics of that policy should be for their students,” he said in a statement to the New Jersey Monitor.
Both candidates are running to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat barred from running for a third term this year. Murphy backed a plan earlier this year to yank phones from students’ hands during classroom instruction, but the bill has yet to get a vote in the state Assembly (it passed the Senate unanimously).
The bill would require New Jersey’s education commissioner to develop guidelines that prohibit non-academic use of cellphones or social media during classroom instruction and would also require local school boards to develop policies consistent with the state guidelines.
A third of public teachers say cellphone distraction in the classroom is a major problem, according to Pew Research. A Columbia University study shows that cellphones and social media can also harm kids’ mental health, disrupt sleep, and contribute to cyberbullying and isolation.
Last month, the state Department of Education released a report laying out three example policies that could be adopted: school districts could hold onto students’ devices during the school day; students could keep phones on them if they are turned off; or a version of the two to allow students to use their devices outside of academic time.
Sponsors of the bill said they’re hopeful these recommendations will push the bill forward. The Legislature does not return to Trenton for a voting session until after the election. Murphy’s term does not end until Jan. 20.
More than two dozen states have some regulation banning phones during the school day, and several New Jersey school districts have adopted their own rules barring phones.
Sherrill, when asked how she would sway lawmakers not convinced by Murphy’s push to ban phones in schools, said her proposed research center would provide data showing how harmful cellphones and social media can be, with the goal of educating more families on their impact.
“I’m not sure your average family gets how harmful some of this is and the bad outcomes we’re seeing, and so having the data alone is going to, I think, push the legislation to the forefront,” she said.
Ciattarelli took a shot at Sherrill’s approach for telling “parents what to do about their child’s cellphones in schools.”
“Students are best served when parents and school districts work together in partnership,” he said.

A Missouri company is taking an Iowa health care provider to court, accusing it of trying to poach dying hospice patients.
National Hospice Management Inc., or NHP, is suing Moments Hospice of Davenport in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
NHP provides hospice and related nursing services through hospice centers in several states, including Iowa where it operates Beacon of Hope Hospice in Davenport.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the lawsuit, Jaycie Klein worked at Beacon of Hope as a care coordinator and was responsible for marketing NHP’s services in Scott, Clinton and Muscatine counties. Moments Hospice is a competing hospice agency that owns and operates hospice centers in Iowa.
The lawsuit alleges that Klein entered into noncompete agreement with NHP when she was hired, agreeing not to compete with NHP or solicit NHP patients for their business for one year after leaving employment with NHP. The geographic scope of the noncompete agreement was anywhere within 65 miles of NHP’s locations in Davenport and Galesburg, Illinois.
Shortly after Klein quit her job at NHP in May 2025, the lawsuit claims, she began working for Moments Hospice at its location in Hiawatha near Cedar Rapids. While Hiawatha is 83.6 miles from Davenport by the most direct route while driving, the lawsuit alleges the two locations are within 65 miles of each other “and, thus, within the restricted area of the non-compete agreement.”
“National Hospice’s business depends on its customer base,” the lawsuit alleges. “Since leaving National Hospice, Klein has solicited National Hospice’s customers. Klein has continued to contact National Hospice’s customers and their family members in violation of her non-compete agreement.”
The lawsuit alleges tortious interference with NHP’s contract with Klein and seeks a court injunction to block any further interference.
Moments Hospice has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was not able to reach anyone at the company’s Hiawatha location to comment on the case.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
The state budget Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed this week included transparency requirements — one would give parents more insight into what reading curriculum their school uses — and a new rule to bar schools from using financial incentives to encourage students to attend school on Count Day.
These were among some of the lesser known parts of the budget, with much of the attention going to record levels of per-pupil funding, a big increase in at-risk funding, and the protection of an initiative that provides free breakfasts and lunches to students regardless of income.
The budget also included more money for schools to lower class sizes in the lower grade levels, eliminated flexibility that allowed districts to hold up to 15 days of virtual instruction, and created a new funding source to provide additional pay for teachers.
The budget was approved after months of stalled negotiations, and after the legislature blew two budget adoption deadlines.
Some of the new provisions are puzzling because there was little to no discussion about them, said Robert McCann, executive director of the K-12 Alliance of Michigan, a group that represents the interests of dozens of school districts in the state. He raised concerns that the budget includes new curriculum requirements well over a month into the school year.
“This is just another example of how broken this budget process was,” McCann said.
Here are some details about the budget:
 Parents to get a heads up if their child’s school uses a reading curriculum that isn’t recommended

New language in the budget requires districts to notify parents if their schools use a K-5 reading curriculum that isn’t on the state’s list of evidence-based curriculum, or that isn’t aligned with state standards. An evidence-based curriculum is one that research has shown to be effective. As part of that notification, schools must tell parents that the curriculum they’re using “could negatively impact student academic outcomes.”
Whitmer proposed such a transparency measure when she presented her budget proposal earlier this year.
The new requirement comes in the midst of disappointing student performance on state and national exams. On the National Assessment of Educational Progress, known as the Nation’s Report Card, just 24% of Michigan fourth graders were considered proficient, and results overall showed little improvement even as other states showed gains. On the Michigan Student Test of Educational Progress, performance in many grades and subjects went up slightly, but third graders posted their worst reading scores in the 11-year history of the exam.
In addition to informing parents that the curriculum doesn’t meet state guidelines, school leaders must also let parents know why they’re using a curriculum that isn’t evidence-based and share a plan for when such a curriculum will be adopted.
If schools fail to notify parents, they risk losing up to 5% of their state aid.
 No more financial incentives for Count Day

Another way schools can lose up to 5% of their state aid: by offering financial incentives to students to attend on Count Day.
Some schools have offered gift cards or other incentives for students who show up. But it’s unclear how widespread those practices are across the state.
There are two count days in Michigan: One on the first Wednesday in October and another on the first Wednesday in February. Student enrollment counts on those days largely determine how much state aid a school district receives.
And because schools are funded on a per-student basis, getting kids to school has been vitally important on those days. (Schools can still count some students who are absent on Count Day as long as they attend school within a certain time period afterward.) It’s why some enrollment-challenged schools entice students to attend by offering things like pizza parties for the classroom with the highest attendance, extra classroom credits, and fun activities.
 Additional funding to lower class sizes

The budget sets aside $65 million, to be paid in grants, to allow school districts to maintain or establish lower class sizes in grades K-3.
School districts with large percentages of students from low-income homes would be eligible to receive the grants.
Class sizes would be capped at 19 students per class.
The budget identifies several school districts (Muskegon Heights Public School Academy System, Benton Harbor Area Schools, Flint School District, and Wayne-Westland
Community School District) to automatically receive these class size grants.
The budget also allows all districts to use up to 30% of their at-risk funding to reduce class sizes.
 No more virtual instruction days

The budget eliminates language that allowed school districts to hold up to 15 virtual instruction days.
Michael Rice, who retired Friday as state superintendent, has pushed the legislature to remove that language, as well as flexibility that allows up to seven professional development days to count as instructional days. During professional development days, teachers spend the day training, and students stay home and receive no instruction.
The virtual hours provision was struck, but schools can continue to count the professional development days as instructional days.
 New teacher pay fund

The budget includes $350 million in one-time grants to increase educator compensation, though details are still scarce about how the money can be spent.
 Districts must report to parents on how at-risk grant money is spent

The budget increases funding for at-risk students by 25%, but it also adds a new reporting requirement for school districts.
Districts receiving the at-risk money must now provide a report to parents that shows how much funding they received, how the money was distributed, and what evidence-based interventions were used with the funding.
Districts must also provide a method for which parents can provide feedback on how the money is used.

Job Point, a long-established career training and employment center in Columbia, submitted a letter of intent and proposal to the commission. It hopes for the green light to begin working toward a public charter school focused on workforce-related skills.
A YouthBuild-Workforce Charter School would follow Job Point’s mission of linking people to jobs through career planning and vocational training. If approved, the school would likely not open until fall 2027. It would serve students 17 and older.
Charter schools are independent public educational institutions that are free of some regulations that might apply to traditional public schools. They have been an option in Missouri since 1998, and 81 charter schools are currently operating in St. Louis and Kansas City.
In 2024, the Missouri General Assembly passed a law to allow charter schools to legally operate in Boone County despite opposition from Columbia Public Schools and other school districts in the county.
Funding is a major concern for many of those opposed to charter schools. While charter schools don’t take money directly from public school districts, they are funded by taxpayer dollars.
Charter schools and Job Point
Charter schools typically seek to meet a specific community need that may not offered at other schools, such as art, science and technology or vocational training.
The proposed charter school would follow the model of Job Point’s YouthBuild program, which has been established in Columbia for 22 years.
The program is designed to help 16- to 24-year-olds get their high school equivalency and workforce training after dropping out of high school, said John Scalise, president and CEO of Job Point in Columbia.
Nine trade programs are offered by YouthBuild in Columbia. The programs can help youth to get their drivers license, teach them to build homes and offer paid internships in Columbia.
YouthBuild receives funding through a Department of Labor federal grant, although that will cease in 2028.
“With the YouthBuild federal dollars going away, we’re looking for a way to continue our program,” Scalise said. “It’s been a value to the community, so we’re hoping that we can find ways to continue that.”
Noah Devine, executive director of the Missouri Charter Public School Association, said a charter school could support students who are struggling.
“This is a critical way that will permit Job Point to be able to serve more students who might be struggling in the more traditional setting and getting them on a path to a living wage job,” Devine said.
“Job Point is seeing a different way to meet an increasing need for kiddos experiencing homelessness, (or) not finding the right fit in the traditional school setting, (or) trying to find a living wage job,” Devine said.
 The process

Establishing a charter school requires lengthy review and extensive paperwork.
The proposed charter school is just in the beginning stages. If the Missouri Charter School Commission approves its initial letter and prospectus, Job Point will be invited to submit an application, which would then undergo a more extensive review.
Unlike traditional public schools, which are held accountable by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, charter schools must also have a sponsor that monitors academic performance and progress.
Historically, the number of successful applications for establishing a charter school is small.
“Theoretically, they like the idea of the school,” said Jeff Rainford, spokesperson for the charter school commission. “But the devil is in the details. If they are invited, then it’ll be about if they can do what they actually aspire to do.”
It helps that YouthBuild has established charter schools in California and Illinois.
“There’s a model there,” Devine said. “They know what they do, and they do it well. They’re not just inventing something.”
The final step is submission to the Missouri State Board of Education. If approved by Jan. 31, the school can be opened in the fall of the same year.
“Job Point likely cannot meet that deadline for Jan. 31 of 2026,” Devine said. “So they would have to meet it in 2027 in order to open for the 2027-2028 year.”
 Resistance from public schools

Even though nearly every school district relentlessly fought the idea, the state senator who represented the county was determined to allow charter schools in Boone County.
Just months before he left office, former state Sen. Caleb Rowden persuaded his colleagues to pass the bill.
“I want public education to be functioning, hitting on all cylinders,” Rowden said at the time. “I want those schools to be museums where people can go and get the best education that they can get anywhere in the world.”
For local school districts, the funding mechanism was a big sticking point.
“The No. 1 beef that the community should have with charter schools is that we did not approve that use of our tax dollars as a community,” said Suzette Waters, a member of the Columbia School Board.
Job Point would draw from an enrollment pool that already exists, she said, and money follows the student.
“It becomes unsustainable, and taxes would have to go up,” she added.
Additionally, Waters questioned the success of charter schools in general.
“More than 50% of them have closed,” she said. “Over the past 20 years, charters across the state have not shown to be any more effective at producing academic outcomes than their traditional neighborhood schools.”
Two YouthBuild charter schools have closed in St. Louis – one in 2002 and one in 2014, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
But, the YouthBuild Charter School of California “has graduated over 6,500 students since its founding, with a one-year graduation rate around 78%,” according to a news release from the Missouri Charter Public School Association.
Job Point’s target enrollment for its first year is 45 students in grades nine through 12.
Currently, through partnership between Columbia Public Schools and Job Point, five district students are involved in a Job Point job coaching program with space for 16, Waters said.
“We are beating the bushes and can find five children that want to take advantage of those services? There’s space for 16, and we can only find five,” Waters said.
The district already provides the Missouri Option Program for students 17 or older at risk of dropping out to earn a diploma, she said.
“Job Point is not coming up with something that we’re not already doing with great success,” Waters said. “We are already providing alternative programming and specialty support in Title I schools.”
Scalise has a different outlook about the way a Job Point charter school would fit into the Columbia community.
“When there is something new, you’re either focused on danger or opportunity,” Scalise said. “We are certainly focused on the opportunities that come with it.”
“Our goal,” Scalise said, “is to really continue to help people and our community, and provide opportunities to get from where they’re at to where they want to be on the career track.”

San Diego County is bracing for missed paychecks and the possibility of a run on food banks as the federal shutdown extends into its second week. 


With the highest military population in California, San Diego County is bracing for missed paychecks and a run on local food banks during the federal shutdown, now in its second week.
Last week armed service members and federal employees were furloughed or notified that they’ll have to work without pay after Senate Democrats and Republicans faced off over healthcare spending and other issues.
California has the most service members of any state, with about 213,000 active duty military and reserve, according to federal data. More than half of those – 117,000 service members – are based in San Diego County, along with 34,000 civilian military employees, who “would be forced to work without pay during a shutdown,” three local Congress members stated.
The county hosts five military installations, including the West Coast powerhouses of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and Naval Base San Diego. It’s also one of the priciest areas, with the city of San Diego ranked as the 9th most expensive urban area by the Council for Community and Economic Research this year.
That adds up to a big headache for military personnel and their families, many of whom stretch their dollars under normal circumstances and may go without pay this month. Officials said they were paid as usual Oct. 1, but many could miss out on their next paycheck on Oct. 15. Others who are paid monthly could see their wages frozen Nov. 1.
“We know that because of the cost of living in San Diego that active duty troops are already having a hard time getting by,” Rep. Scott Peters, a San Diego Democrat, said. “We’d like to get this over as quickly as possible. This is no way to support them.”
Rep. Mike Levin, a Democrat from Carlsbad and Dana Point, said Congress members have proposed a bill called the “Pay our Troops Act,” which would extend military pay during the shutdown.
“I don’t think our service members should be caught in the middle of that,” he said.
There’s been no movement on passing that bill, but Levin signed a letter urging House Speaker Mike Johnson to bring it to a vote.
Military families prepare for pay loss
Local groups that support military families are gearing up in case the shutdown stretches from weeks to months.
“Rent still needs to be paid, food needs to be put on the table, cars need to be paid for, and our military families are now in the stress of uncertainty,” said Maggie Meza, executive director for the San Diego Chapter of Blue Star Families.
The group’s annual survey found that most military families nationwide have less than $3,000 in savings, and one in four service members struggle to put food on the table. That’s a big problem for newer service members at the lower end of the pay scale, advocates said. 
“That is an immediate impact for many people living paycheck to paycheck, like many of our junior troops are,” said Janessa Goldbeck, CEO of Vet Voice Foundation. 
With grocery prices up because of inflation and tariffs, food is a top concern. San Diego’s inflation rate in July was the highest in the country at 4%, driven by rising costs of food, fuel, healthcare and cars. To make up for the growing gaps in food access, the San Diego Food Bank and Feeding San Diego plan to expand food distribution and add pop-up food banks near military installations.
The San Diego Food Bank serves 400,000 people each month, and about 10% of those are military members and their families, CEO Casey Castillo said. That could rise by tens of thousands if the shutdown persists. 
“We have reserves on hand and we also have a financial reserve policy that allows us to respond to emergencies like this,” Castillo said. “We have already started to place orders, in case demand spikes during the shutdown. And it’s also an opportunity to work with the community on food drives.”
Allison Glader, a spokesperson for Feeding San Diego, said the organization saw an uptick in food bank use last week, which could represent people stocking up in anticipation of a pay freeze next week. Economic conditions in San Diego put many service members on edge, even before the shutdown, she said.

“You don’t get to choose where you’re stationed,” she said. “Maybe what was okay in another city is not able to stretch enough to make ends meet (in San Diego.) Then you’re choosing between putting gas in the car, food on the table, or paying the electricity bill. One missing paycheck: that’s life-changing.”
More shutdown woes
The status of federal food assistance complicates the picture. Both the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Women, Infants and Children (WIC) have money for this month, but aren’t funded after that, Levin said
Military child development centers, base commissaries and healthcare facilities could also cut services or hours. The Naval Medical Center San Diego stated online that it would provide routine and emergency care, but claims could be delayed during the shutdown.
“There’s a lot of dual military families that rely on childcare services,” Goldbeck said. “So you’re asking people to show up for work without pay, and potentially with no childcare for their kids.”
She said the shutdown could also have foreign policy impacts if financial uncertainty undermines morale and weakens force readiness.
“If you are stationed across the world and you’re trying to focus on being on a mission and you’re having to think about the fact that your family might not have food on the table, it’s a very stressful scenario,” Glader said.
Public lands and beyond
San Diego has no national parks, but Cabrillo National Monument and Cleveland National Forest are both closed to the public. A notice on the monument website stated that “All events (including education programs) are cancelled while the lapse of appropriations continues.”
Monument staff did not respond to questions during the closure, but Goldbeck, whose organization organizes veterans to support public lands, said dozens of school field trips and weddings were called off.
The National Park Service stated that 846,000 people visited the monument last year, spending about $60 million in the community and contributing $80 million to the local economy. So its closure could dampen regional tourism.
The 46,000-acre Cleveland Forest can’t merely shut a gate to keep motorists and hikers out, but the absence of forest staff and rangers creates a risk to both the natural resources and tourists who ignore the closure. During the 2018 shutdown, unauthorized park visitors damaged ancient trees at Joshua Tree National Park and littered Death Valley with mounds of toilet paper.
“Last time the government shut down we saw overflowing trash and human waste and we saw people walk in where there are no emergency services,” Goldbeck said.
Air traffic controllers and TSA staff are also subject to the shutdown and may have to work without pay. The Federal Aviation Administration reported that staffing shortages are creating flight delays around the country as airport workers call in sick. San Diego air traffic controllers had to step in to manage flights at Burbank Airport, after its air traffic control tower was temporarily left unstaffed Monday.
But San Diego International Airport, which opened a new terminal last month, hasn’t seen flight delays or staff shortages so far, officials said.
“San Diego International Airport continues to operate normally,” and essential federal aviation personnel including air traffic controllers are expected to remain on duty, airport spokesperson Nicole Hall said in a statement Tuesday.
But as “travel volumes grow or federal staffing constraints intensify, delays may occur.”
The San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce warned that the shutdown could destabilize cross-border business relationships between San Diego and Mexico, upsetting industries including tourism and defense.
”Every day the government is closed creates disruptions that impact businesses, workers, and families across our binational region,” CEO and President Chris Cate said.
What lawmakers are doing
In San Diego, as in Washington, D.C., Democratic and Republican lawmakers hold each other at fault for the shutdown. 
Jonathan Wilcox, a spokesman for Rep. Darrell Issa, San Diego’s lone Republican representative, said Congressional Democrats set the expiration date for the healthcare tax credits in the original legislation, so they’re responsible for that program’s sunset.
“(Issa) voted to maintain funding at current levels and keep the government open,” Wilcox said. “Every Democrat in the San Diego delegation voted no. Then Senate Democrats shut down the government. I think that record is clear.”
The tax credits, introduced under former President Biden in 2021, made healthcare more affordable for millions, and their expiration could double health insurance premiums for up to 600,000 Californians.
While Democrats set a time limit on the original tax credits for policy holders, they’ve staked their position on extending it before policy holders face sticker shock during open enrollment next month. They received unexpected support across the aisle this week.
“Democrats, and now (Republican Rep.) Marjorie Taylor Greene, are calling for the premium assistance to be extended and for Medicaid cuts to be rescinded,” said Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at UC San Diego. “And Republicans are opposing that. So there is an honest policy debate on healthcare that is driving the shutdown.”
Levin and Peters said it’s up to Republicans to negotiate a compromise.
“The Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House,” Levin said. “They could end this today.”
The White House did not respond to questions from CalMatters about the effects of the shutdown in San Diego. 
Levin said he requested to have his own pay withheld during the shutdown, and Peters said he will donate his to military organizations. Both questioned why President Donald Trump, with a reputation for dealmaking, hasn’t stepped in to end the impasse.
“Here is the opportunity for this supposed great dealmaker to get the people in the room and make the deal, and so far he’s not even trying,” Levin said.
There’s more to their ask. Trump has clawed back congressionally approved funding for programs including foreign aid, infrastructure and education. So if Democrats agree to funding, they want to make sure he’ll spend it.
“We’ll need some assurance that if we make a deal, he’s going to follow the deal, otherwise it would be foolish for us to agree,” Peters said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/091925-US-Marines-San-Diego-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-09 09:57:30.350454

Over the past decade, there have been at least a dozen major refinery explosions and fires in California — with the two most recent explosions erupting at PBF Energy’s Martinez refinery earlier this year and Chevron’s El Segundo refinery last week. 
But as President Donald Trump’s administration works to weaken regulatory oversight and California lawmakers expand in-state oil drilling, the lack of a centralized authority to investigate refinery explosions is raising questions about who is scrutinizing the state’s oil industry after serious accidents.
As CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo explains, the Oct. 2 explosion in El Segundo would have prompted a probe by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, an independent federal agency regarded as a key source of information for the causes behind major refinery incidents. But Trump has viewed the board as duplicative, and has eliminated its funding in his most recently passed budget.
Instead, the explosion is being investigated by Chevron, as well as various state, regional and local agencies. The California Environmental Protection Agency isn’t leading an investigation, but said it will support the El Segundo Fire Department in its safety review.
Meanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill last month to boost oil production in Kern County in an apparent about-face on his former crusade against Big Oil. This comes amid state agencies delaying new measures — initially championed by Newsom — intended to further oversee refineries.

More on refineries: A string of refinery closures and planned shutdowns are leaving many of California’s 100,000 fossil fuel workers struggling to find jobs, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
In addition to the Marathon refinery in Contra Costa County closing in 2020, Phillips 66 plans to close its Los Angeles refinery by the end of this year. A Valero refinery in Solano County is also expected to shut down in the next few months.
The closures are likely to lead to more layoffs. But for refinery workers who have no college degrees and earn between $80,000 to $200,000 a year, finding a job with comparable pay is difficult. Though the state last year offered $30 million to workforce organizations to train refinery workers for new jobs, only a fraction has received support.

Officials arrest Palisades Fire suspect

On Wednesday the U.S. Department of Justice said it arrested a former Pacific Palisades resident suspected of starting the fire that eventually became the Palisades Fire, which killed 12 people and destroyed over 6,000 structures in January.
Jonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old living in Florida, was driving for Uber in L.A. the night of Dec. 31, 2024. Pulling together statements from witnesses, video surveillance footage, cellphone data and other evidence, law enforcement officials determined that Rinderknecht “maliciously set” a fire shortly after midnight near or at the Palisades’ Skull Rock trailhead. Though firefighters suppressed that fire, it continued to smolder underground and then resurfaced a week later as the Palisades Fire.

Bill Essayli, acting U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, at a press conference: “As the world watched in horror as the Palisades Fire burned, victims perished in the smoke and flames. … Though homes and businesses cannot be rebuilt, this arrest, we hope, will provide a measure of justice to all those who were impacted.”

If convicted, Rinderknecht could spend up to 20 years in federal prison. The cause of the Eaton Fire, which also broke out Jan. 7 and killed 18 people, is still under investigation. The Justice Department is suing Southern California Edison in connection to it.



New CA laws are on the way

Gov. Newsom signed more bills into law this week. Some measures that will take effect on Jan. 1 include:

Processed foods: California will become the first state to ban ultra-processed foods from school meals. By 2035, schools must phase out these foods, which are characterized by, among other things, artificial flavors and colors; sweeteners that aren’t nutritious; and high levels of saturated fat, sodium or sugar. Read more from CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.


Sex abuse in schools: All of California’s public and private K-12 schools will be required to train teachers, coaches and staff on how to recognize signs of and prevent sexual grooming and misconduct. The measure will also create a database that administrators must use to vet prospective teachers for potential misconduct. Read more from CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones. 


Elections and voting: To help speed up elections, county election offices will have up to 13 days after Election Day to count ballots. Officials still have 30 days to certify election results, however. Newsom also signed another bill that makes it illegal for people to pay others to register to vote.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-09 12:44:51+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Massachusetts offered up $35M in offshore wind tax breaks. They’ve gone unclaimed for two straight years.,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/massachusetts-offered-up-35m-in-offshore-wind-tax-breaks-theyve-gone-unclaimed-for-two-straight-years/,A state tax program meant to catalyze the offshore wind industry in Massachusetts hasn't drawn any interest.,"IT WAS THREE SHORT YEARS AGO that Massachusetts legislators enacted an ambitious package designed to boost offshore wind and other clean energy technologies. 
The year was 2022. Joe Biden was in the White House, Democrats controlled the US Congress, and the economy started to emerge from its Covid slump, so officials on Beacon Hill were hopeful about the opportunity to bring home a sizable chunk of the economic bounty thought to be tied to offshore wind. 
With the idea of turbines sprouting up off the coast and union workers assembling the parts necessary to deploy the technology, then-Gov. Charlie Baker signed legislation including $35 million in tax breaks for offshore wind companies to build a domestic supply chain in the Bay State. 
The problem is there have been no takers. 
For each of the past two years, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) ran formal solicitations offering the tax credits. For each of the past two years, MassCEC received no applications and made no awards, the agency confirmed to CommonWealth Beacon. 
This latest revelation paints a picture of just how stark of a difference has emerged between Massachusetts’s offshore wind vision and the reality — even before President Trump took office and quickly cracked down on clean energy projects around the country. Since his second inauguration, the Trump administration has sought to revoke permits for offshore wind projects and rescind a designation for 3.5 million acres in federal waters that would have allowed for large-scale wind development. The uncertainty has made it difficult for wind developers and the commonwealth’s utilities to negotiate a price for wind power. 
“What I blame are the supply chain disruptions that came out of the pandemic and then intensified in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” said Sen. Michael Barrett, a Democrat who co-chairs the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy and played a key role in crafting the 2022 climate law that authorized the tax breaks. “Those tax breaks would be working today and doing their intended work if offshore wind were a successful and ongoing thing. But everything depends on an ecosystem that is healthy in the present and is looking toward a predictable future.” 
MassCEC’s solicitation included $35 million in tax credits over a five-year period for creating new permanent jobs and investing in offshore wind facilities to stimulate manufacturing and supply chain capacity in the industry.  
The intent, Barrett said, was for the tax breaks to incentivize smaller businesses to engage in offshore wind research and manufacturing of component parts like sensors and cables to support the larger offshore wind developers. 
But when the industry’s foundation – the big developers with leases to sites in the Atlantic –began to crack, the ensuing economic boom didn’t materialize as projected, rendering the tax breaks ineffective.  
Even before the second Trump term, the offshore wind industry was reeling from a period of global supply chain disruption, climbing inflation and high interest rates that drove up costs of projects along the East Coast. Two Massachusetts offshore wind projects paid $60 million and $48 million in 2023 just to get out of previously-signed contracts in response to those economic issues.  
MassCEC blamed those macroeconomic factors for the lack of uptake of the tax breaks, saying in a statement that the past two years were “challenging” for the industry and that businesses ultimately “need to be in a commercial position to make good on the financial investment and/or the new permanent employee hiring and retention” to qualify.  
This June, the state unveiled lower standards a company must meet to qualify for the jobs credit. Offshore wind companies previously were required to commit to creating at least 50 net new permanent jobs in Massachusetts to be eligible for the tax break. That threshold has been lowered to just 10 net new permanent jobs in the state.  
MassCEC said it plans to continue to offer the tax credits next year. 
The lack of interest in these tax breaks comes as the state has struggled to attract and keep related wind projects on track, with several of the most high-profile initiatives located in environmental justice communities.  
Because of the federal uncertainty, at least $100 million of the funding the state set aside for wind projects in 2022 are in doubt, according to a list of MassCEC awards.  
For example, a $75 million award to Crowley Wind Services and the City of Salem to convert a former coal-fired power plant into an offshore wind port is in limbo after the Trump administration withdrew $34 million in federal money to support the project.  
Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo told CommonWealth Beacon that the city, MassCEC, and Crowley are hoping to make a decision “as quickly as possible” how best to proceed, whether that be identifying additional funding to cover the gap for the roughly $300 million project or scaling back development plans to meet the new reduced budget. The wind port may also need to temporarily serve non-offshore wind tenants given the Trump administration’s pause on permitting new wind projects, Pangallo added.  
“This was a project that was going to create American jobs, American energy that was clean, reliable and renewable,” he said. “It was going to reactivate our port, which is a historic site that’s contributed to the economy of our nation for almost 400 years now. It’s incredibly frustrating to see this opportunity, this chance to create jobs, stimulate our economy and grow our American energy supply, just being allowed to sit dormant.” 
The state also awarded $25 million to an Italian company to build a wind cable manufacturing facility at the Brayton Point Marine Commerce Center in Somerset, the site of an old coal-fired power plant. Biden even visited the site a few months before that award to tout the intersection of renewable energy and jobs.  
“It doesn’t get much more exciting than having the president come into town to highlight the future of the industry,” recalled Casey Bowers, vice president of government relations at the Environmental League of Massachusetts, which in 2020 founded the New England for Offshore Wind coalition.   
But the company withdrew its plans shortly after Trump took office.  
MassCEC then notified the company, Prysmian, “that the grant was terminated,” an agency spokesperson said. That brought the agency back to the drawing board for the site as it considers options for reallocating that funding.  
With Republicans in charge in Washington, federal clean energy tax credits are being phased out, and no new offshore wind projects are likely to be approved. Vineyard Wind, the state’s lone offshore wind development currently in operation, has for now been left untouched by Trump’s efforts to shut down other fully permitted wind farms.  
The federal hostility on top of an already shaky landscape for offshore wind before Trump took office is butting up against state climate targets: Massachusetts is required by state law to lock in 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by the middle of 2027. It’s also laying bare the challenges with fulfilling the job prospects and economic revitalization that Bay Staters were hoping would come along with the investment in clean energy. 
“Our members were absolutely lining up, and we were taking in apprentices, and we were training people” to go into the offshore wind industry, said Frank Callahan, president of the Massachusetts Building Trades Unions. “A lot of young people were attracted to these careers. They wanted to be part of this exciting new industry. And they don’t know what’s going to happen right now.” 
With offshore wind likely to languish further into Trump’s term, state officials are looking to pivot to other energy sources that can bring down energy costs while meeting climate commitments. 
“We need to shift strategy to solar,” Barrett said. “We had an offshore wind strategy, and we want to hold that one in reserve until circumstances improve. But for now, it’s solar, and I don’t see a true blueprint for developing solar.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image0032.webp?fit=642%2C856&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-09 08:57:02.364206

He says the people who oversaw him were unqualified.,"In summary
California fired its top cybersecurity official. He says the people who oversaw him were unqualified.


California’s outgoing cybersecurity commander says the state is mismanaging its limited cybersecurity resources by letting unqualified officials set priorities.
In an exclusive interview with CalMatters, the commander, Edward Bómbita, said the agency should become independent.
Bómbita was terminated from the state’s top cybersecurity post in a phone call from the governor’s office Sept. 23; his last day is Friday. He had been on the job less than a year but repeatedly found himself at odds, he said, with officials at the Office of Emergency Services. That agency oversees the one Bómbita ran, the Cybersecurity Integration Center, through its Homeland Security division.
In Bómbita’s telling, he wanted to focus on protecting critical water and electrical infrastructure and helping small cities and schools protect themselves online; the Office of Emergency Services wanted him to focus on threats that had not yet impacted state networks, such as North Korean scammers seeking remote jobs or online threats against health care executives following the killing of UnitedHealthcare Chief Executive Brian Thompson.
Bómbita argues that the 80-person cybersecurity center should be independent in order to better prioritize limited resources and to avoid interference from emergency services leadership that “don’t understand cyber well enough to lead this effort.”
“In an ideal world, we would have a cybersecurity agency for the state that was an independent agency that didn’t answer to the governor or the Legislature, just answer to the people,” he said. “It’s an amazing organization, it’s just in the wrong agency and should be its own thing.”
The governor’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Office of Emergency Services spokesperson Anita Gore did not respond when asked about Bómbita’s remarks, saying only that protecting Californians from cyber threats remains a top priority for her agency.

Bómbita began his job after the state left the post vacant for more than two years.
The cybersecurity commander is in charge of protecting California’s infrastructure and economy, communicating threats to public and private partners, and assisting law enforcement agencies with investigations. Bómbita’s departure comes as the federal government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is faltering, having reportedly lost roughly one-third of its workforce since the start of the Trump administration. It is now caught up in an ongoing government shutdown with most of its employees furloughed and the rest working without pay.
Bómbita, who previously served in the California National Guard and the U.S. Navy’s Fleet Cyber Command, said he was told he was dismissed for not supporting the governor’s priorities. But he thinks he was actually fired for pushing back on decisions about how to run the cybersecurity center.
Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks, authored legislation that helped create the cybersecurity center. She said it might be a good idea to consider the structure and placement of the center now that it is over a decade old. She said she’d like to work with the governor next year “to identify and hopefully adopt any recommendations for improving its outcomes for Californians.”
Irwin, who chairs the Assembly select committee on cybersecurity, called cyber attacks one of the greatest threats California faces and urged the governor to fill the commander vacancy. 
A former California cybersecurity commander, speaking anonymously because of fear of professional retaliation, agreed that the Cybersecurity Integration Center should become an independent agency. The person told CalMatters the governor should make the commander position capable of carrying out independent audits of state agencies or abolish the center entirely.
“Until or unless the governor forces agencies to abide by what Cal-CSIC does and to support them, it’s going to be what it always has been, a great idea on paper,” they said.
Several Office of Emergency Services Homeland Security division employees, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, told CalMatters they believe it’s time to consider moving the center into a different department or making it an independent agency reporting to the governor.
“What we’ve been doing for 10 years isn’t working and the common denominator is OES so maybe we should be looking elsewhere,” one of them said.
“What we’ve been doing for 10 years isn’t working and the common denominator is OES.”Employee, Homeland Security division, California Office of Emergency Services
The Office of Emergency Services coordinates state disaster responses, such as to wildfires, earthquakes and floods. Another cybersecurity employee said it is “completely out of their depth when it comes to cyber. You wouldn’t let your plumber perform surgery on you. How does it make any sense for someone who has no basis in the reality of the cyber world to dictate policy?”
These people also said that morale among cybersecurity center employees is down following Bómbita’s termination and an all-hands meeting last month where emergency services leadership declined to share a clear explanation for why he was let go. A cybersecurity center employee told CalMatters that many of their colleagues choose to work there for stability and because they believe in the mission, but following that meeting a number of people are looking for jobs elsewhere.
“Most of these jobs get paid multiple times [more] in the private sector, so I think we all believe in the mission, and so it’s very disheartening having this happen,” one said.
Bómbita was the third person appointed by a governor to serve as cybersecurity commander since the center was created a decade ago. Former state cybersecurity employees told CalMatters they think it’s difficult for the cybersecurity center to keep commanders because the pay is less than for similar jobs in the private sector and that state employees may treat an acting commander — who will be in the job temporarily — differently than a commander appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.
California faces a number of ongoing cybersecurity threats, ranging from malicious QR codes spread to exploit Los Angeles wildfire victims to ransomware attacks that shut down cities or compromise the personal information of millions of children nationwide.
In addition to ransomware and phishing attacks, Bómbita said California’s top cyber threats are nation-states that attempt to worm their way into U.S. networks, such as the “Salt Typhoon” attacks attributed to China, and new threat vectors posed by artificial intelligence. Last week, the cybersecurity center was tasked with compiling an AI Cybersecurity Collaboration Playbook after Newsom signed a bill into law ordering them to do so.
But perhaps the biggest threat facing California today, Bómbita said, are vulnerabilities at small public-facing institutions like cities and schools. Big cities like Los Angeles are relatively well equipped to weather attacks on their systems, but smaller entities lack the training and personnel to defend themselves, and that poses a threat to state agencies tied to them.
“The fact that state, local, tribal, and territorial organizations and critical infrastructure organizations are so underfunded, undermanned and under-experienced is something that’s really concerning to me,” he said. “It’s going to lead to major, serious issues if a significant threat actor pounces on those vulnerabilities and risks.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100625-Edward-Bombita-MG-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-09 08:57:02.364206

Peter Robertson Amidon
Husband, father, grandfather, beloved friend, and multi-talented musician, Peter Amidon died at home on October 4, 2025, surrounded by close family. Peter was beloved in the Brattleboro community, to which he offered and gave so much. He led “Choirs of the Community” for many events, was one of the musical leaders of the Guilford Community Church, cofounded the Brattleboro Christmas Street Band, co-led the hospice singing group Hallowell, and most recently gathered the ensemble West Willow to sing his many choral arrangements and compositions.
Peter Amidon was internationally known as a choral arranger, community dancing leader, folk singer and storyteller, and as leader in the field of music education, teaching, recording and performing in close partnership with his wife, Mary Alice Amidon. Through their artist in residence workshops in schools and New England Dancing Master’s instructional books and CDs, thousands of teachers and children throughout the United States and beyond have been enriched by traditional dance and song in the classroom. His choral arrangements are being sung by hundreds of choirs throughout the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
Peter was born in Worcester, Mass in 1949, and raised in the Berkshires in Monterey, Mass by his parents Dean and Fran (Robertson) Amidon. He initially attended the one-room schoolhouse there; Dean was a singing leader at the local community campfires and gatherings. Peter attended Miami of Ohio University, majoring in music composition. His life was changed when he discovered folk music while living in Cambridge, Massachusetts – contra dancing, shape note singing, ballad singing and fiddle tunes.
Peter met Mary Alice Copeland at a contradance in 1975, and after touring with Bread and Puppet Theatre throughout Europe, they were married in 1978, and settled in Brattleboro, Vermont. Their son Sam was born in 1981 and Stefan in 1984. As a family, The Amidons performed at folk festivals and in concerts across the United States and in the UK. Peter and Mary Alice were music teachers at Academy School in West Brattleboro, where they started the tradition of All School Sing, before moving on to their freelance work and releasing many beloved albums of folksongs for children and adults alike. Peter and Mary Alice, alongside their New England Dancing Masters colleagues Andy Davis and Mary Cay Brass, received the Country Dance and Song Society’s Lifetime Contribution award in 2023.
Peter is survived by his devoted wife Mary Alice; sons Sam (wife Beth Orton) and Stefan (wife Zara Bode); grandchildren Nancy, Arthur, Desmond, and Vera; brothers Dean (Skippy), Phillip, and Jay and their families, in-laws Annie and Susan Copeland and their families.

Michelle Lujan Grisham will allow the state to rely on other professional organizations' vaccine recommendations rather than the federal government. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday signed the fifth and final piece of legislation passed by state lawmakers during the two-day special legislative session last week.
Senate Bill 3 addresses the state’s vaccine policy, and was introduced during a time in which the federal government had yet to enact its own vaccination schedule in part to allow the state to purchase children’s COVID-19 vaccines. Since then, Acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill has signed off on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccines, and the state health department confirmed earlier this week that those vaccines have been ordered and should arrive in a few weeks.
But the bill also will require the health department going forward to rely on other professional organizations’ vaccine recommendations rather than those of ACIP. In advance of the session, New Mexico Department of Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham told Source NM she hoped the changes in the law will offer state officials more leeway as federal vaccine policy faces delays and uncertainty.
“We are essentially hoping to just broaden the guidance that we can rely on in making vaccine decisions,” Durham said.
The bill engendered significant debate during the special session and passed along party lines, with Republicans opposed. As such, the bill lacked the two-thirds majority vote required to enact an emergency clause and be effective immediately, which the governor noted in her message to the Senate yesterday.
“The changes in SB 3 are vital to safeguarding the health and safety of New Mexicans in light of the United State Department of Health and Human Services’ failure to follow science and make timely and necessary vaccine recommendations,” the message notes. “Importantly, the original version of the bill included an emergency clause, which would have made it effective immediately upon my signing. I thank the Senate for understanding the importance of this legislation and their bipartisan efforts to pass the bill with the emergency clause. But the emergency clause was stripped from the bill when Republican legislators in the House-including many members that voted to pass this bill in their respective committees-injected politics into the matter and decided to withhold their support the last minute. As a result, the House Republicans placed the lives of thousands of New Mexicans at risk as we are headed into peak season for respiratory illnesses such as RSV, the flu and COVID-19.”
The governor said she also was “disappointed with the lack of procedural advocacy by my own party, who appeared unprepared to defend the urgent need for SB 3 during floor debate on the bill.”
Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie, the governor continued, had been preparing another public health order to ensure vaccine access, but the CDC adoption of the ACIP guidelines rendered doing so unnecessary.
“New Mexicans expect elected officials to step up and come together to ensure their well being,” the governor’s message concludes. “I understand that our political parties have some very divergent views and that we will not agree on everything. But preventing our children from getting life-saving vaccines simply because one party frustrated that they are in the minority is unacceptable. Let us not lose sight of the fact that we represent the people of New Mexico. We owe it to them to put politics aside and enact meaningful legislation that will make everyone safer and healthier. This is — quite literally — the most important thing we do in state government. I sincerely hope the Legislature will commit to working together as a body to do this important job during its next regular session in January.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/vaccine-booster-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-09 08:57:02.364206

Shapiro described Trump’s decision to deploy the guard as a “dangerous overreach of power.”,"California National Guard members stand guard at an entrance to the Wilshire Federal Building on June 13, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Pennsylvania has joined several states taking legal action against President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in U.S. cities, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced on Wednesday night.
“Deploying the National Guard to patrol American cities over the wishes of their governors is incredibly dangerous and an unprecedented infringement on states’ rights,” Shapiro wrote on social media. “Pennsylvania just took legal action to support our fellow states and put an end to the dangerous overreach of power we are seeing with Donald Trump’s Guard deployments.”
Over the summer, Trump ordered National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. That action was ruled by a federal judge in California in September to be a violation of federal law against military members conducting domestic law enforcement.
Trump has deployed troops to three cities; Could Philadelphia be on his list?

Since then, Trump has also sent National Guard troops to Chicago, Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon, in what he says is an effort to combat crime. However, elected officials in Illinois and Oregon have argued against this move and have filed legal challenges over it. The Republican governor of Tennessee has welcomed the deployment.
Shapiro joins a coalition of 24 attorney generals and governors in an amicus brief supporting Oregon’s court challenge to Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in their state.
“President Trump’s deployment of Oregon’s National Guard, and attempted deployment of out-of-state Guard forces in Oregon, without the consent of Oregon’s Governor and in violation of the statute on which the President relies, is unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic,” the officials wrote in the amicus brief. “It is inconsistent with one of our Nation’s founding principles that freedom depends on the subordination of the military to civilian authority.”
“It violates core constitutional principles of federalism, and it infringes on the sovereignty and police powers reserved to the States,” they add. “By calling forth troops when there is no invasion to repel, no rebellion to suppress, and when state and local law enforcement are fully able to execute the law, the President flouts the vision of our Founders, undermines the rule of law, and sets a chilling precedent that puts the constitutional rights of all Americans at risk.”

Shapiro has been an outspoken critic of Trump’s threats to send the National Guard to these cities for months, saying that his administration is prepared to act if Trump decides to deploy troops in the Keystone State.
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner held a series of town halls last month to provide advice for what citizens should do if the National Guard was deployed to Pennsylvania’s biggest city, while also sharply criticizing the president’s approach.
Shapiro, noting his current role as commander in chief of the Pennsylvania National Guard and former state Attorney General, referenced his administration funding 1,500 more police officers  as a reason that gun deaths have decreased in the state since he was sworn in to office.
“If Donald Trump is actually serious about crime, he should support states and local governments who know their communities best,” Shapiro wrote.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/losangelesnationalguard-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-10-09 08:57:02.364206

With the U.S. Chemical Safety Board defunded, California has yet to fill the gap.","In summary
An El Segundo refinery fire has renewed questions about who is investigating the state’s oil industry after serious accidents. With the U.S. Chemical Safety Board defunded, California has yet to fill the gap.


An explosion rattled windows across nearby neighborhoods. Orange columns of flame shot like blowtorches out of stacks and pipes, uncontrolled.
The incident that shook Chevron’s El Segundo refinery last week once would have prompted a federal investigation. Not anymore.
As the Trump administration moves to weaken the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, California still hasn’t said whether any agency, department or authority will take charge of a comprehensive investigation when a refinery erupts — something that’s happened twice this year.
Separately, in response to fears over higher gas prices, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers have opened the door to more drilling, and state agencies have delayed, or moved to loosen, new oversight measures. 
“It does raise the issue of who’s watching the refineries,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “They’re the most dangerous manufacturing facilities we have in our communities.”
Scholars and engineers as well as local agencies and fenceline communities have seen the now-inactive chemical safety board as a vital source of information into the causes of major incidents at refineries. The independent federal agency “was the gold standard for investigations of these kinds of incidents,” said Greg Karras, an environmental advocate and independent consultant.
But the Trump administration has argued that the board “duplicates substantial responsibilities” of other agencies. In President Donald Trump’s first term, the White House proposed eliminating the board; in this second term, executive branch officials have again proposed to zero out its budget.
The California Environmental Protection Agency is not leading a broad, multi-regulatory investigation after the Oct. 2 explosion. Instead, says CalEPA spokesperson Diana Ibrahim, the agency is “ready to support” the El Segundo Fire Department, which will lead a safety review.
Other state, regional and local agencies are investigating for their own purposes — a specialized unit of the California Department of Industrial Relations for worker hazards, the South Coast Air Quality Management District for pollution and the California Energy Commission for fuel supply — while Chevron runs its own internal review.
“It’s quite siloed,” said Earthjustice attorney Oscar Espino-Padron. “It’s often difficult to point to one body that’s really helping to coordinate and compile all of the necessary information.”
Earlier this year, an explosion at the Martinez Refinery, owned by PBF Energy, injured six workers and caused a shelter-in-place order. The Martinez and El Segundo incidents are the latest in a string of nearly a dozen major refinery explosions and fires in California over the past decade. 
Some lawmakers and advocates are frustrated that the state has yet to get ahead of the problem.
“A fire in El Segundo has to happen for us to … wake up?” said state Sen. Lena Gonzalez, a Democrat from Long Beach whose bill to create a statewide standard for refinery air-quality monitoring was vetoed by Newsom last year. “It’s just so ridiculous.”
Watchdogs said to struggle reining in refineries
State and local agencies that launched investigations after last week’s fire have struggled to enforce refinery rules in the past, according to observers.
In the five years leading up to the explosion, the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s inspectors issued 46 notices of violation to Chevron in El Segundo. The most recent, issued July 30, alleged that the refinery failed to properly control the burning of excess gases at its Isomax unit, which uses hydrogen, heat and pressure to break down heavier oils into lighter fuels like jet fuel. That’s the same part of the refinery that caught fire last week.
That notice is not yet finalized, a process that can take months or years. Espino-Padron, the Earthjustice attorney, said the air district’s oversight is often opaque, with residents having no easy way to tell when or how a notice of violation is resolved. Penalties also tend to be minimal, he said.
“The reality is there isn’t enough personnel to really provide adequate oversight of these operations,” he said. “What you see is not significant, robust enforcement.”
Rainbow Yeung, a spokesperson for the South Coast air district, rejected criticisms of the district’s inspection practices, enforcement and transparency. Yeung said the district is coordinating with other agencies on possible enforcement actions “with an eye toward protecting the public going forward.”
At the Chevron facility over the last decade, CalOSHA opened 18 accident and complaint inspections, eventually issuing nearly two dozen violations. The most recent CalOSHA investigation began on Sept. 11.
Garrett Brown, a retired employee of the agency, said that the inspection teams are short staffed. The agency’s ability to investigate is “compromised,” he said, in part because of recent turnover. 
Denisse Gomez, from the Department of Industrial Relations, says that Cal/OSHA “has consistently carried out its duties” in responding to refinery incidents and “continues to strengthen its specialized workforce through active recruitment and training to protect workers and uphold California’s nation-leading refinery safety program.”
Safety standards face rollbacks 
California has some of the nation’s toughest refinery safety rules because of two earlier explosions – one in 2012 at Chevron’s Richmond refinery, and another in 2015 at ExxonMobil in Torrance. The rules are built around the concept of process safety, which requires refineries to identify and fix hazards before accidents occur and to involve workers directly in investigations when they do. The system is designed to prevent the kind of cascading failures that have caused refinery explosions in the past.
But after the Western States Petroleum Association sued to block the rules, calling them burdensome, CalEPA and other state agencies quietly settled the suit. Unions and advocates say revisions to two regulations prompted by that settlement could weaken key safeguards.
The agency is updating the accidental release program rule for refineries and has yet to finalize those revisions. A companion rule at the state’s workplace safety agency is unchanged, for now; regulators are proposing to update the rule next year.
WSPA spokesman Jim Stanley did not comment on the settlement or process safety regulations specifically, but he argued that California refineries follow some of the industry’s strictest rules. 
“From CalOSHA to local air districts to the California EPA, refiners work closely with regulators at all levels of government and our partners in labor to minimize the risk of accidents, keep workers and communities safe, and comply with environmental standards,” he said.
But Mike Smith, chair of the United Steelworkers National Oil Bargaining Program, said that the heart of refinery safety is having experts on site who can fully understand what’s happening inside the plant.
“Obviously, any weakening of safety regulations in the refining sector is not good,” he said. 
Smith said that the rules have been under threat after the union was excluded from settlement negotiations between industry and the state over those protocols.
“The foundation really is employee participation,” Smith said. “The experts in the plants playing a role.” 
The debate over those revisions comes as California’s political priorities shift—from tightening refinery oversight to keeping fuel flowing.
California eases up on oil
In an effort to lower gas prices and keep up with growing energy needs, California’s Democratic leaders have softened their stance toward the oil industry this year. For years, Newsom blasted refiners for high gas prices and promised to phase out drilling. Faced with the threat of refineries closing, potentially imperiling supply and pushing up prices, he too has changed course.
In 2024, two days after signing a measure aimed at pricing and maintenance schedules, Phillips 66 announced it would shut its Los Angeles refinery by the end of 2025, citing doubts about the sustainability of California’s market. In April, Valero said it would close its Benicia refinery next year, blaming a challenging regulatory environment.
Last month Newsom signed a bill that opened the way for new wells in Kern County. At the same time, the Energy Commission slowed implementation on many of the measures Newsom had previously pushed, such as ones on fuel inventories, resupply after outages, refinery maintenance and a long-promised price-gouging penalty.
Critics argue those moves have left the state more exposed to price spikes in the wake of the El Segundo fire and without strong tools to steady supply or hold refiners accountable. That’s “very dangerous in moments like this,” said Court of Consumer Watchdog.
Stanley, the spokesman for WSPA, said the refinery rules and other measures were impractical.
Following the fire, Chevron made adjustments to its operations to ensure fuel supply to Southern California, Reuters reported. Chevron spokesman Sean Comey told CalMatters that the refinery paused the flow of outbound product pipelines from the refinery the night of the incident, but restarted them after three hours.
The Energy Commission has said it is focused on keeping fuel supplies steady and prices down. But in a key report published this summer, commissioners warned that years of under-investment and deferred maintenance have created “safety and reliability challenges” at aging refineries. The report urged the state to stabilize fuel supplies through a mix of legislative and regulatory steps — including the postponing of rules to stave off further closures. 
Niki Woodard, a spokesperson for the California Energy Commission, said the El Segundo fire is expected to hit jet-fuel supplies harder than gasoline, with jet-fuel prices jumping about 30 cents Friday and and negligible changes at the pump in the wake of the incident.
Though prices at the pump have barely moved, some experts warn that the state’s effort to keep fuel affordable may be coming at the expense of safety. Environmental consultant Karras said the state should view refinery safety as an economic issue.
“The state’s refining fleet has gotten to the point where it just can’t keep blowing itself up without starting to have to import gasoline,” he said.
With the federal government furloughed and Trump’s newly passed budget moving to permanently wind down the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, Karras said state leaders could still assemble a strong independent investigation into the El Segundo fire by hiring furloughed or former chemical safety board experts.
“There’s a tremendous amount of experience and expertise to do an investigation if state leadership had the political will,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100225_Chevron-Refinery-Fire_Reuters_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-09 08:57:02.364206

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A new analysis breaks down the political implications of three proposed congressional maps that have been submitted to a Utah judge for consideration — one from Utah lawmakers and two from the plaintiffs in the ongoing redistricting lawsuit against the state. 
The three biggest takeaways from the report by the Better Utah Institute — a nonpartisan nonprofit that is related to the progressive advocacy group Alliance for a Better Utah — come down to the following: 

The Utah Legislature’s map, Option C, “keeps the current partisan skew intact – uncompetitive, tilted strongly Republican, with a glaring efficiency gap.” 
The plaintiffs’ Map 1 “corrects the partisan imbalance neatly by creating one safe Democratic district and three safe Republican ones,” the report says. “It’s fairer by the numbers but still largely noncompetitive.” 
The plaintiffs’ Map 2 “creates one district with closer margins between parties, increasing competitiveness while maintaining proportionality.” 

Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

The Better Utah Institute analysis doesn’t pick a preferred map, but shows there’s a “clear divide” between the Utah Legislature’s map and the plaintiffs’ maps. 
While the plaintiffs’ maps align more closely with statewide vote share, the Legislature’s map “maintains the existing partisan distribution,” the analysis concludes. “Each map reflects different trade-offs between fairness, competition, and community representation.”
The report comes as Utah’s rare, mid-decade redistricting process transitions from a special session at the Utah Capitol on Monday, when lawmakers convened to vote on their preferred map to submit to a judge for further consideration. The Republican-controlled Legislature chose a map that the Utah Republican Party last week encouraged its members to support, while Democrats criticized it as the worst option. 
The same day, the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit — which led to the court ruling that voided the 2021 congressional boundaries and initiated the court-ordered redistricting process now underway to remedy that map — submitted two maps to 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson.
Now, Utah’s redistricting process moves to the courtroom. Gibson will decide which map meets legal and constitutional standards. At the very latest, state elections officials have said a new map must be adopted by Nov. 10 so counties can use it to prepare for the 2026 elections.
Plaintiffs submit 2 congressional maps to judge as Utah lawmakers vote on their own

Under the 2021 congressional map that’s since been voided by the courts as the result of an unconstitutional process, Republicans have easily dominated all four of Utah’s U.S. House seats. However, depending on the map that ultimately gets adopted for the 2026 elections, Utah voters may have a better chance of electing a Democratic member of Congress for the first time since then-Rep. Ben McAdams was elected in 2018. 
“The stakes couldn’t be higher,” the report says. “Congressional district boundaries influence who wins elections, how accountable lawmakers are to their constituents, and whether communities feel truly represented. A fair map doesn’t guarantee political outcomes for any party but it does ensure that voters’ voices are accurately reflected at the ballot box.”
To help Utahns understand the impacts of each map, the Better Utah Institute analysis uses five redistricting metrics: proportionality, competitiveness, compactness, splitting, and the efficiency gap. 
“Together, these measures provide a clearer picture of how each map would translate voters’ choices into actual political power,” the report says. 
Here’s a breakdown of each of those criteria: 

Proportionality: How closely the share of seats a party wins matches its overall share of the statewide vote. A higher score on a scale of 0 to 100 indicates a more proportional map.
Competitiveness: How likely it is that more than one political party has a real chance of winning in a district. A higher score on a scale of 0 to 100 indicates a more competitive map.
Compactness: How geographically tight and regularly shaped a district is, instead of being stretched or oddly contorted. A higher score on a scale of 0 to 100 indicates a more compact map.
Splitting: How often a map divides cities and counties between multiple districts, with lower scores indicating fewer unnecessary splits.
Efficiency Gap: How much one party wastes more votes than the other through packing and cracking, indicating partisan bias in a map.
Partisan Margin: The number of percentage points one party is expected to win over the other in a given district, based on recent election results or projections.

“They have health care needs, but they don’t have the digital skills,” said Waiters, who is a digital navigator for an Alabama nonprofit. Her work has involved giving away computers and tablets while also teaching classes on how to use the internet for work and personal needs, like banking and health. “It’s like a foreign space.”

Waiters is part of a network of digital navigators across the country whose work to bring others into the digital world was, at least in part, propped up by a $2.75 billion federal program that abruptly canceled funding this spring. The halt came after President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that the Digital Equity Act was unconstitutional and pledged “no more woke handouts based on race!”
The act lists exactly whom the money should benefit, including low-income households, older residents, some incarcerated people, rural Americans, veterans, and members of racial or ethnic minority groups. Politicians, researchers, librarians, and advocates said defunding the program, along with other changes in federal broadband initiatives, jeopardizes efforts to help rural and underserved residents participate in the modern economy and lead healthier lives.
“You could see lives change,” said Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, recalling how they helped grandpas in Iowa check prescriptions online or laid-off factory workers fill out job applications.
Help for telehealth
The Digital Equity Act is part of the sweeping 2021 infrastructure law, which included $65 billion to build high-speed internet infrastructure and connect millions without access to the internet.
This year, Congress once again pushed for a modern approach to help Americans, mandating that state leaders prioritize new and emerging technologies through its $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program.
A KFF Health News analysis found that nearly 3 million people in America live in areas with shortages of medical professionals and where modern telehealth services are often inaccessible because of poor internet connections. The analysis found that in about 200 mostly rural counties where dead zones persist, residents live sicker and die earlier on average than people in the rest of the country. Access to high-speed internet is among a host of social factors, like food and safe housing, that help people lead healthier lives.
“The internet provides this extra layer of resilience,” said Christina Filipovic, who leads the research for an initiative of the Institute for Business in the Global Context at Tufts University. The research group found in 2022 that access to high-speed internet correlated with fewer COVID deaths, particularly in metro areas.
During the covid-19 pandemic, federal lawmakers launched a subsidy program paid for by the infrastructure law. That aid, called the Affordable Connectivity Program, aimed to connect more people to their jobs, schools, and doctors. In 2024, Congress did not renew funding for the subsidy program, which had enrolled about 23 million low-income households.
This year, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revamped and delayed the infrastructure law’s construction initiative — known as the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, or BEAD — after announcing plans to reduce regulatory burdens. More than 40 states and territories have submitted final proposals to extend high-speed internet to underserved areas under the administration’s new guidelines, according to a Commerce Department dashboard.
Termination
In May, the Digital Equity Act’s funding was terminated within days of Trump’s Truth Social post. While many states in 2022 had received money to plan their programs, the next round of funding, designated for states and agencies to implement the plans, had largely been awarded but not distributed.
Instead, federal regulators — including the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the federal agency overseeing implementation of the Digital Equity Act — notified recipients that the grants would be terminated. The grants were created and administered with “unconstitutional racial preferences,” according to the letter.
In Phoenix, officials learned in January that the city was slated to get $11.8 million to increase internet access and teach digital literacy, but they received an email May 20 stating that all grants, “except for grants to Native Entities,” had been terminated. “It’s a shame,” said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a Democrat. The money, she said, would have helped 37,000 residents get internet access.
Georgia’s Democratic leaders in July sent a letter to Lutnick and NTIA’s then-acting administrator, Adam Cassady, urging reinstatement of the money, noting that the federal cut ignores congressional intent and violates public trust.
The act’s creator, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said during an online press conference in May that Republican governors in 2024 supported the law and its funding when each state touted completing its required digital equity plans and asked for resources.
“I cannot believe there aren’t Republican governors out there that are going to join with us to fight back on this,” Murray said, adding “the other way is through courts.”
‘In every state, there’s a loss’

All 50 states developed digital equity plans after months of focus groups, surveys, and public comment periods. NTIA Digital Equity Director Angela Thi Bennett, during an August 2024 interview with KFF Health News, said the “intentional community engagement” by federal and state leaders to deliver broadband to unserved communities was “the greatest demonstration of participatory democracy our country has ever seen.”
Thi Bennett could not be reached for comment on this article. NTIA spokesperson Stephen Yusko said the agency “will not be able to accommodate” a request for an interview with Thi Bennett and did not respond to questions for this article.
Caroline Stratton, a research director at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, said the act’s funding allowed states to staff offices; identify existing high-speed internet programs, including those operating within other state agencies; and create plans to fill the gaps.
“This sent folks out looking,” Stratton said, to see whether agencies in the state were already working on health improvement plans and to ask whether the broadband work could contribute and “actively help move the needle.”
State grant applications included goals to promote health care access. In Mississippi, the plan consists of the state university and another agency’s health improvement plan, Stratton said.
While states were required to create programs that would help specific covered populations, some states modified the language or added subcategories to include other populations. Colorado’s plan included immigrants and “individuals experiencing homelessness.”
“In every state, there’s a loss,” said Angela Siefer, executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance. The nonprofit, which was awarded nearly $26 million to work with organizations nationwide, filed a lawsuit Wednesday  asking Trump and the administration to distribute the money.
The nonprofit’s grant had been planned to support digital navigators in 11 states and territories, including Waiters. Her employer, the nonprofit Community Service Programs of West Alabama, expected to receive a $1.4 million grant.
In the past two years, Waiters spent hours driving the roads of rural Alabama to reach residents. She has distributed 648 devices — laptops, tablets, and SIM cards — and helped hundreds of clients through 117 two-hour digital skills classes at libraries, senior centers, and workplace development programs in and around Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
People of “all races, of all ages, of all financial backgrounds” who did not “fit into our typical minority category” were helped through her work, Waiters said. Trump and his administration should know, she said, “what it actually looks like for the people I serve.”

The result was a 14-part series in the Sacramento Bee, later published as a book titled “The New California: Facing the 21st Century.”
Its overall theme was that massive changes in the state’s economy — shifting from manufacturing to services and technology, coupled with equally massive cultural and ethnic changes, along with rapid population growth — were reshaping the state’s future.
I quoted two researchers, Leon Bouvier and Philip Martin, who projected California’s future as “the possible emerging of a two-tier economy with Asians and non-Hispanic whites competing for high-status positions while Hispanics and blacks struggle to get the low-paying service jobs.”
Any objective description of 2025 California would conclude that Bouvier and Martin, a UC-Davis faculty member at the time, hit the nail squarely.
A new article in Forbes magazine by Michael Bernick, a lawyer who was director of the state Employment Development Department a quarter-century ago, compares two-tier California to “Upstairs, Downstairs,” a 1970s British television series.
The 68-episode series explored relationships between a wealthy family and its servants as a microcosm of the socioeconomic trends affecting Great Britain during the early 20th Century.
Bernick notes that current California economic numbers are lackluster, but behind that data is the more fundamental reality of “California’s evolving Upstairs, Downstairs economy: its prospering Upstairs college-educated professional and knowledge economy workers, and the army of Downstairs service economy workers who serve them.
“This two-tier economy is not new,” Bernick continues. “It has been building in the state over the past two decades — and in some ways since the late 1970s. What is new is how this economy is so widely taken for granted in 2025. It is accepted as the natural order by the very people on the Upstairs who regard themselves as champions and protectors of the working class and poor.”
Those in California’s mostly white and Asian overclass, Bernick writes, “have been increasingly vocal this year in denouncing the national administration. They denounce inequality and poverty, and speak often of social justice. But they are silent as to the low wage workers who attend to their daily needs, and the inequality that they benefit from. In fact, policies they and the state’s political leadership have advocated for the past decades have expanded the Downstairs workforce.”
Bernick contrasts current California with its more egalitarian and economically mobile mid-century version but adds, “There is no way of going back to this earlier economic structure of a greater self-sufficient middle class, but also no reason to do so.”
However, Bernick adds, “it is one thing to serve others and another to serve others in a position of low pay, status, and authority. That’s the condition in California with its Downstairs workers, the result of policies by state government dating back to the 1990s and of culture shifts. The state Legislature has imposed an empire of rules and costs that has undercut the ability of California employers to create stable, decently-paid jobs. In the place of a jobs strategy, an expansive benefits system has been assembled. Perhaps of greatest consequence, many of the service and blue collar jobs have come to be viewed as beneath Californians. Immigrant workforces have been brought in, helping to keep wages low.”
Bernick concludes that if answers to the low wage jobs problem are scarce, “a start is to at least be honest about politics. The equality politics and rhetoric of the state’s Upstairs workforce bear little relation to their high degree of entitlement today, and how the state’s economy actually is operating.”

California health officials will now decide which ingredients, additives, dyes, and other forms of processing don’t belong in school meals and K-12 cafeterias. 


California is the first state in the country to ban ultraprocessed foods from school meals, aiming to transform how children eat on campus by 2035. 
In the cafeteria of Belvedere Middle School in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a measure that requires K-12 schools to phase out foods with potentially harmful ultraprocessed ingredients over the next 10 years. The requirements go above and beyond existing state and federal school nutrition standards for things like fat and calorie content in school meals.
California public schools serve nearly 1 billion meals to kids each year.
“Our first priority is to protect kids in California schools, but we also came to realize that there is huge market power here,” said Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat. “This bill could have impacts far beyond the classroom and far beyond the borders of our state.”
The legislation builds on recent laws passed in California to eliminate synthetic food dyes from school meals and certain additives from all food sold in the state when they are associated with cancer, reproductive harm and behavioral problems in children. Dozens of other states have since replicated those laws. 
The bipartisan measure also comes at a time when U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement has shone a spotlight on issues including chronic disease, childhood obesity and poor diet. 
The term “ultra-processed food” appears more than three dozen times in the MAHA report on children’s health released in May. A subsequent MAHA strategy report tasks the federal government with defining ultraprocessed food.
California’s new law beats them to the punch, outlining the first statutory definition of what makes a food ultraprocessed.
It identifies ingredients that characterize ultraprocessed foods, including artificial flavors and colors, thickeners and emulsifiers, non-nutritive sweeteners, and high levels of saturated fat, sodium or sugar. Often fast food, candy and premade meals include these ingredients.
Researchers say ultraprocessed foods tend to be high in calories and low in nutritional value. Studies have linked consumption of ultraprocessed foods with obesity. Today, one in five children is obese. 
Ultraprocessed foods are also linked to increased cancer risk, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
Studies have found sweetened beverages and processed meats to be particularly harmful, said Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Work Group, which sponsored the legislation. Kids are particularly susceptible to the effects of ultraprocessed foods, she said.
“Ultraprocessed foods are also marketed heavily to kids with bright colors, artificial flavors, hyperpalatability,” Stoiber said. “The hallmarks of ultraprocessed foods are a way to sell and market more product.”
Gabriel said lawmakers and parents have become “much more aware of how what we feed our kids impacts their physical health, emotional health and overall well-being.” That has helped generate strong bipartisan support for the law, which all but one Republican in the state Legislature supported. 
A coalition of business interests representing farmers, grocers, and food and beverage manufacturers opposed it. They argued the definition of ultraprocessed food was still too broad and ran the risk of stigmatizing harmless processed foods like canned fruits and vegetables that include preservatives. Vegetarian meat substitutes also generally contain things like processed soy protein and binders that may run afoul of the definition.
Gabriel contends that the law bans not foods but rather harmful ingredients. The California Department of Public Health now must identify ultraprocessed ingredients that may be associated with poor health outcomes. Schools will no longer allow those ingredients in meals, and vendors could replace them with healthier options, Gabriel said.

(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri’s bank balance looked pretty healthy at the end of September. But in reality, it’s like the family account before the mortgage check clears — and there are signs that future revenue will struggle to meet expectations.
Three months into the fiscal year — and three months before lawmakers return for a session that will write the next budget — fluctuations in daily revenue figures can cause repeating cycles of elation and concern, said newly-appointed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Rusty Black.
As of Sept. 30, revenues for the year to date were down 0.6%, while a few days later, on Saturday, reports showed they were up 0.4%. The official forecast is for revenues to increase 1.6% in the year that ends June 30.

“If you look at one day or one month, you get really excited, and the next day might completely change it, especially this early in the process,” Black said in an interview with The Independent. “At the end of August, there were people coming up with ways to spend extra money.”
There was $7.1 billion in the general revenue fund and accounts that can be spent like general revenue in the state treasury on Sept. 30. The uncleared checks total $5.6 billion — $1 billion for capital projects from past years; $2.1 billion earmarked for major projects like expanding Interstate 70; and $2.2 billion to cover the difference between projected revenue and spending for state operations.
The coming year will bring additional pressure on current revenue as the state exhausts extra federal aid for health care banked during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make up the difference, the Department of Social Services is asking for $784 million in two areas of the Medicaid program.
Two other items push the need for new spending to continue current operations above $1 billion. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education says it needs $190 million to continue foundation formula school aid at current levels and $32 million to meet the demand for student transportation.
 Revenues flat

When lawmakers wrote the current budget, they were working from a consensus estimate that the general revenue fund would bring in $13.6 billion this fiscal year. The trend through Saturday would result in revenue about $75 million below the estimate.
And state Budget Director Dan Haug said in June that there won’t be another $2 billion available in the coming year to cover the gap between spending and revenue. The unencumbered balance on June 30, he said, will be around $700 million.
“The times are going to be getting tougher as we go forward, and so I think we would like to try to limit general revenue spending so that we are able to craft responsible budgets,” Haug told lawmakers at the time.
The estimate made in December didn’t account for tax cuts made by lawmakers in the spring — an exemption for capital gains income and an increase in a property tax credit program for lower income people over 65 or living with disabilities.
Missouri budget director Dan Haug speaks during the 2024 legislative session to the House Budget Committee. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
The official estimate for the capital gains exemption is a revenue reduction of approximately $157 million in the current fiscal year and about $111 million annually on an ongoing basis. Other estimates, however, put the potential cut in revenue at $625 million or more.
Most of the benefits from the capital gains exemption would go to a small slice of taxpayers. The 23,800 federal returns filed for 2022 with incomes greater than $500,000 a year represent 0.8% of all returns but included 65% of the capital gains income.
“It’s really important that folks recognize that this is for the ultra-rich at the front of the line,” said state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern of Kansas City, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. “But all the people I talk to every day who are going to the grocery store and recognizing that their food costs more, that their prescription drugs cost more, that their utilities are costing more, aren’t getting any relief whatsoever from the General Assembly, and that’s what I find most frustrating.”
Another factor putting downward pressure on revenues is interest income. As interest rates rose, and Missouri’s fund balances soared, so did interest revenue. But balances are falling and rates are down slightly. So far this year, the income from overnight deposits is down about $22 million.
Democrats who lead their party in budget committees of both chambers said they are worried that Republicans in the majority will continue to push for tax cuts despite growing demands for spending.
“I am very concerned,” Nurrenbern said. “We are really headed towards this fiscal cliff much sooner than many anticipated.”
The last time there was a major decline in state revenue, following the 2008 financial crisis, higher education and school transportation were among the services hardest hit by cuts.
“We can look back in history on tough fiscal years and see the services that get cut first,” Nurrenbern said.
Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe has targeted the income tax for elimination but that doesn’t answer where the state will obtain its revenue, said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
“I would encourage the majority party to stop having conversations about reducing our state budget and our state revenue by such significant amounts without a solid plan to backfill,” Fogle said.
 Spending demands

There are two types of spending items in the Missouri budget — mandatory outlays and discretionary disbursements.
Mandatory items include public school support, which must be at least 25% of revenue, and Medicaid, which has its own list of mandatory services in order to qualify for federal matching aid. Another mandatory item is pension and other benefits for state workers, which is estimated at 65% of payroll for the coming year.
Discretionary disbursements are anything not required by law, and can range from small-dollar earmarks to major construction projects such as the $2.8 billion program to add lanes to Interstate 70.

Kehoe vetoed $300 million in discretionary spending in June, and restricted the release of $211 million more. In his veto message, Kehoe warned of a $1 billion spending shortfall in the coming year.
Of the four new budget requests that total $1 billion, two are mandatory and one — fully funding school transportation — is discretionary. The fourth — $190 million in new money to maintain current support for schools in the foundation formula — is viewed as mandatory by Democrats but may not be by Kehoe.
The largest mandatory item is $421 million to continue the managed care program that covers most families on Medicaid. The money is needed to replace a federal pandemic fund that will be exhausted by the end of the year.
The other major Medicaid mandatory item is $363 million for the adults age 19 to 64 covered under the constitutional amendment passed by voters in 2020. The program is budgeted to cost $4.2 billion in the current year, with federal funds paying 90%.
Since the program was placed into a separate line item for fiscal 2023, there has been no general revenue cost for the expansion population of 350,000 Missourians. The state’s 10% share has been paid from pandemic health care funds supplied from Washington.
By the end of the fiscal year, that means federal funds have paid for $17 billion in health assistance to Missouri with no direct cost to the state taxpayers.
“We have not had to cover any of that 10% because it’s being covered by this Stabilization Fund, which was originally about a billion dollars, and it’s going to be exhausted in about a year,” said Tim McBride, a professor in the Washington University School of Public Health who studies Medicaid financing and previously served on the oversight board of Missouri’s Medicaid program.
There have also been shifts in applications away from traditional Medicaid programs toward the expansion group, especially among people with disabilities, McBride said. The savings to state general revenue from that shift is equal to about half of the state’s share of the Medicaid expansion program.
“If you can do it, you don’t have to go through a bunch of paperwork, and get a doctor to approve it,” he said. “So you might as well do that.”
While many aspects of Medicaid are mandatory, such as hospital care, physician visits and medical transportation, others are not. Optional services include physical therapy after an injury or surgery, dental services, eyeglasses and home-based care.
Rep. Betsy Fogle, D-Springfield, speaks at a press conference Feb. 13 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
In 2005, when the state was facing a shortfall in Medicaid, many optional services were cut. Many have been restored but they could be eliminated again, Democrats said.
“I was in a primary care association meeting a week or two ago where the conversation, the dialogue, surrounded or started to become, ‘what services are we going to cut?’” Fogle said.
Changes to federal budgeting included in the bill signed in July by President Donald Trump will likely add billions to the state’s costs for participating in shared programs. 
The biggest portion of that shortfall will be in the Medicaid program, which became a prime target for cuts in the federal budget bill. According to KFF, Missouri could lose approximately 14% of its federal Medicaid funding over the next decade, or approximately $17 billion.
That will mean a close look at whether the state can afford optional services under Medicaid, said House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
“In some cases, we’re more generous than the federal law requires, so you could look at things like that,” Deaton said.
Another way to control costs in Medicaid is to cut the payments to medical providers, Deaton noted.
“Those would probably be the things that I would be looking at,” he said.
Along with $421 million from general revenue to replace other resources in the managed care program, the social services agency is asking for $90 million of general revenue, and $343 million overall, to increase monthly payments by 6.5% for managed care in Medicaid.
McBride said he doesn’t see why the increase is necessary when medical inflation is running at about 3%. There should be ways to make it less expensive without cutting services, he said. 
Missouri spent an average of $9,382 for every person enrolled in Medicaid in fiscal 2023, KFF said in a report issued Monday. 
That is $1,804 more than the average of the eight states surrounding Missouri. Only Kansas and Nebraska have higher average costs.
“Missouri, for some reason, is more expensive for most population groups than most other states,” McBride said. “Why that is is not clear to me, but I don’t think we do a very good job of controlling costs in Missouri.”
 New budget leadership

For the first time since 2019, state Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield, will not be the chairman or vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Hough was fired by Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin in September after opposing leadership tactics to slam through a new congressional district map and changes to how majorities are calculated for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative. 
Black, who was vice chair under Hough, said he expected to become chairman at some point.
“Did I know it was going to happen that day, that way? No, I did not,” Black said. “But did I realize there’s a chance I’m going to be making appropriations decisions for the state? Yes, I was hopeful that would have happened.”
Black said other lawmakers should not expect any disruption in the process of designing the budget. He was on the House Budget Committee when he was a representative and has been on the Senate Appropriations Committee since his election to the upper chamber.
The job will be tougher with tighter finances, Black said.
“People will be in a position to have to make decisions that none of them will be good, none of them will be popular, but our state’s not going to borrow money to keep going,” he said.
Black was the Senate sponsor of the redistricting plan and his willingness to take it to a vote without allowing any amendments is troubling, Nurrenbern said.
“That is an example of him taking orders from Republican leadership and relinquishing his responsibilities of being a senator,” she said. “And so for that reason, I share those concerns of how he’s going to approach being the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.”
Any cuts, Black said, will be as painless as possible.
“Some of those decisions won’t be easy to make if it happens,” Black said. “But I will try to do my best to make them do no harm to Missourians, unless we get to a point where I have to.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_black1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-09 08:57:02.364206

Jacky Rosen speaking on the Senate floor on Sept. 30. (Rosen Senate office video stream screengrab)Democratic U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen said Wednesday it would be “a little naive” to vote for a Republican funding plan to reopen the government without first obtaining firm commitments that Republicans will reverse course and extend health insurance subsidies so as to prevent skyrocketing premiums. 
Preventing cuts to health care subsidies is an urgent priority,  Rosen said during a press call Wednesday. In a few weeks, open enrollment for the health exchange will begin. Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike, though the increases could be far greater from many Nevadans.
“We’re talking about more than 38,000 people in our state alone losing their coverage right away, all because Washington Republicans refuse to act,” Rosen said. “Let’s be clear, this is going to affect everyone. Not just people on the exchange. Everyone with health insurance is going to see a price hike as a result.”
The federal government shutdown Oct.1 after the Senate failed to pass a continuing resolution to keep funding the government until Nov. 21.
Democrats have backed a separate plan that not only funds the government, but rolls back GOP cuts on Medicaid and permanently extends subsidies to the Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums. That plan has also failed to pass the Senate.
Rosen underscored during the call on Wednesday that Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress and the White House, could reopen the government anytime they wanted to if they supported the Democratic resolution. 
Some Republicans are hearing from constituents about changes to health care and have expressed openness “behind the scenes” to extending health care subsidies, Rosen said. 
When Republican U.S. Rep. “Marjorie Taylor Green is out there publicly saying, ‘let’s fix this, because my kids are not going to be able to afford their damn insurance, and they’re not able to go to the doctor,’ I think it would be in everyone’s best interest come to the table and talk to us,” Rosen said. 
President Donald Trump also indicated on Monday he would be open to negotiating over the ACA premiums, but then later clarified in a social media post that Republicans would not be negotiating until after the shutdown ended. 
Congressional Republican leaders have repeatedly asserted that they refuse to address health care and ACA subsidies until a sufficient number of Senate Democrats vote for the Republican funding bill and reopen the government.
An earlier government shutdown was averted in March, when ten Senate Democrats, including Nevada’s Catherine Cortez Masto, voted with Republicans for a continuing resolution without getting anything in return.
Since then, Republicans haven’t come to the table to negotiate over health care subsidies, Rosen said. 
To take Republicans at their word now when they say “‘trust me,’ when they violated that trust every single time, it’s a little naive on our part,” she said
“If we have a framework, if they come and talk to us, there would be folks who would consider working on things,” Rosen said. 
The government never shut down during the Biden Administration, even during the final two years when Republicans controlled the House, Rosen noted.
“We had no shutdowns over four years,” she added. “We brought them to the table every time. We negotiated and figured out how to keep our government open. We expect that same respect.”
She also pointed to an interview Trump did prior to his presidency when he said the president should take the blame if the government shuts down.
Cortez Masto, along with Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Senate Democrats, recently voted with Republicans to keep the government open despite more Democratic colleagues digging in this time around.
Rosen said she respected Cortez Masto’s vote but just “came to a different decision on how I want to fight” for health care. 
“Every one of us votes the way that we think is correct,” Rosen said when asked about Cortez Masto’s vote. “I voted the way I did because I believe that fighting for people’s health care is one of the most important things I can do.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image-10-8-25-at-5.35 PM-1024x577.jpeg,,,2025-10-09 08:57:02.364206

The 53-unit development is planned for year-round camping without the gear, but with the amenities of a luxury resort. Talaz, as it’s known, is intended to create “a positive impact through nature-based hospitality,” according to its website. It’s equipped with air conditioning, running water, and electric vehicle charging stations. 
“Camping is evolving,” Julie Regan, executive director of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, said of the project at a meeting in late September. “How people experience the great outdoors is evolving.” 
But enjoying the great outdoors should not require the removal of healthy trees, say critics.  
The TRPA, which is made up of representatives from Nevada and California, approved the proposal, with only two members against it – both of them from California.
“It is a substantial amount of tree removal,” observed TRPA Governing Board member Ashley Conrad-Saydah, who serves as California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s appointee on the board.  Conrad-Saydah noted the planned removal of trees from 58% of  the site “is nothing to just sniff at.” She asked that the removal plan focus “first on the dead and dying trees” that create a fire hazard. 
TRPA’s approval process, which involves a checklist, rather than an environmental impact study, determined the removal of the trees “will have no significant impact” on the environment. 
The finding “proves yet again (TRPA) does not know how to assess environmental impact,” civil and environmental engineer Alan Miller said during public comment. “Almost 300 trees, and all will be cut, and there’s no significant effect from that.” 
Miller noted that at the same meeting, the TRPA approved a fine of $20,000 against a homeowner who cut down two trees of 14-inch or greater diameter without approval, a violation of TRPA rules, and mandated the resident plant four trees in their place. 
The Tahoe basin is already enduring the effects of climate change, which is worsened by the removal of trees, experts say. Warmer temperatures inhibit the mixing process responsible for the lake’s clarity, an attraction that helps lure millions of tourists a year. 
Rachel Bowers, the developer of the project, told the TRPA she intends to “reforest in a more healthy manner,” and contends “the Jeffrey Pines are somewhat of an invasive species, and it’s actually hurting the health of the forest in Tahoe.” 
Experts, however, note that Jeffrey Pines are the most common tree in the Tahoe Basin and are native to the area. 
Roughing it? 
“This is really a kind of a next generation response to camping,” Lew Feldman, an attorney representing the developer, said of the glamping trend. “You can now camp without gearing up.’” 
Feldman noted his client is paying development mitigation fees of more than $275,000 to TRPA  “for a pretty low impact undertaking.”  
The nine-acre property was initially zoned for a single-family home, but its use as a campground “offers a greater public benefit and access to recreation than the previously approved residential use, and other potential uses of private property,” says the TRPA’s findings in support of approval.  It also allows “more visitors to camp near Lake Tahoe…” 
Residents argue the last thing Tahoe needs is more tourists, and suggest the development resembles a hotel more than a campground.  
“I can see why some people are making the arguments that this is a hotel versus a campground,” said Vince Hoenigman, also an appointee of Newsom. 
“TRPA should not be approving more of these massive projects without environmental analysis, at the very least,” Tahoe resident Dr. Staci Baker told the Current. 
But TRPA’s Regan said the Tahoe Basin isn’t anywhere near its capacity for development. 
“We adopted an update of our regional plan in 2012. We’re 13 years in, and we are still under the development caps that were set forth in that plan. We’re not even close to where we thought,” Regan said of the TRPA’s development projections. 
California Senate Rules Committee Appointee Alexandra Leumer, who voted against the proposal, said she’d “love to see access to people that generally can’t afford to come to Tahoe.” 
She asked staff “to revisit how we’re defining camping.” 
Glamping, Leurner observed, “is beginning to get us into a gray area. I’m not feeling like this is even accomplishing some of the goals that I would like to see us prioritizing with camping.” 
Conrad-Saydah of California said she wanted “a sense of what a stay at this place would cost, If we’re not actually increasing accessibility for people in middle or lower income ranges, we’re just sort of forcing folks into casinos or lower priced hotels and motels around the lake, instead of giving them this access to nature,” she said. “I think that’s a really critical thing to understand. Who is this development serving?”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/A910330A-13E1-493E-933B-42AF8D70F4E9-e1759968860677-1024x696.jpeg,,,2025-10-09 07:57:32.381064

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)States are doing what they generally do during a federal government shutdown: continuing to operate programs serving some of the neediest people.
That means schools are still serving federally subsidized meals and states are distributing funding for the federal food stamp program. For now.
If the shutdown drags on and federal dollars run out, states can only keep programs going for so long. States may choose to pay for some services themselves so residents keep their benefits.
But this time, state leaders have new worries about getting reimbursed for federal costs once the federal spending impasse is resolved. That’s traditionally been the practice following a shutdown, but the Trump administration’s record of pulling funding and targeting Democratic-led states has some officials worried about what comes after the shutdown.
Many states already struggled to balance their own budgets this year. And some fear going without federal reimbursement for shutdown costs could force states to make painful cuts to their own budget priorities.
Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine, a Democrat, said the administration has not made good on its word to states in recent months — freezing some congressionally approved funding and cutting already awarded grants. So it’s likewise unclear whether the federal government will follow previous practice and reimburse states for covering shutdown costs of crucial federal programs such as food assistance.
Conine fears state could get stiffed by Trump after fronting funds during government shutdown 

“I think everything is a risk with this administration. … We in the states are kind of left holding the bag yet again as the federal government tries to sort out what it wants to be when it grows up,” he told Stateline.
Nevada entered the shutdown with more than $1.2 billion in reserves. Last week, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office said in a statement that state funds would be adequate to cover “a short period of time with minimal disruption to services.”
But the governor’s office said a shutdown of more than 30 days would cause more significant challenges for the state.
Lombardo’s office did not respond to Stateline’s questions. But last week, it released a three-page document on the shutdown, saying it expected the federal government to reimburse states once the budget stalemate is resolved.
“As D.C. works through its issues, our administration will continue to support Nevadans in any way we can throughout this unnecessary federal government shutdown,” Lombardo said in the statement.
While mandatory programs such as Medicaid and Social Security continue to send funds to beneficiaries during the shutdown, funding for other safety net programs such as food assistance are more uncertain. The federal government told states there were enough funds for the food stamp program to cover October benefits, though the special food program for women, infants and children may run out of money sooner.
By furloughing workers and halting federal spending, the shutdown could cost the national economy $15 billion per week, President Donald Trump’s economic advisers estimated.
The White House says a prolonged shutdown will affect the economies of every state by reducing employment, federal benefits and consumer spending. White House estimates say this could cost Michigan $361 million per week in lost economic output, for example, while Florida could lose $911 million each week.
 ‘Fend for themselves’

Some federal services are shuttered during a shutdown: The Environmental Protection Agency has ceased many research, permitting and enforcement efforts, and official jobs data is no longer being released. Federal funds for other programs, including food assistance, are expected to last through the end of the month. But states can elect to spend their own funds on these programs, which were previously authorized by Congress and state legislatures.
Before the shutdown, states were stockpiling reserve funding. The National Association of State Budget Officers reported most state budgets this year maintained or increased rainy day funds. At the same time, state and local governments are borrowing record amounts: As much as $600 billion in municipal bonds is projected to be issued by the end of 2025.
“So states and localities are kind of getting the message they really need to fend for themselves much more than they ever had,” said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that works to support public sector workers.
Since January, the Trump administration has stripped states and cities of billions of dollars that Congress approved for education, infrastructure and energy projects. Glasgall said that record leaves states with legitimate concerns about getting repaid for their shutdown-related expenses — a prospect that would likely spark even more lawsuits from Democratic-led states.
“They’ve already, before the shutdown, started rolling back federal funding, and I don’t see any reason why they would stop now,” he said. “The recissions that have been announced are pretty harsh, and it’s money we’re expecting and not getting.”
The last shutdown, which lasted five weeks during Trump’s first term, delayed billions in federal spending and reduced gross domestic product — the value of all goods and services produced — by $11 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2019. Experts say states were repaid for costs they incurred providing federal services during that shutdown.
In Minnesota, State Budget Director Ahna Minge said staff have been studying previous shutdowns. But at a news conference with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz last week, she characterized this shutdown as “unpredictable.”
“The current federal administration may not follow the historic playbook,” she said.
Walz said farmers would be among the first hit as the federal Farm Service Agency has ceased operations in the middle of the state’s harvest season. Among other duties, that agency works on disaster assistance and processes loans during harvest to protect farmers against commodity price fluctuations.
Minge said Minnesota officials think programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children have enough existing federal funds to operate through October. But she said the state budget cannot backfill all the commitments made by federal programs.
“What we know is that the longer a shutdown lasts, the greater the impact to state programs and services,” she said.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, has pledged to use state dollars to keep WIC afloat if needed, The Associated Press reported. And Colorado lawmakers set aside $7.5 million just before the shutdown to keep WIC running.
 Already under strain

In Maryland, the shutdown is compounding the economic instability from Trump’s ongoing efforts to shrink the number of federal employees, agencies and spending.
With more than 160,000 federal employees, Maryland’s economy relies heavily on the federal workforce. The Trump administration has said it may deny back pay to hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers, despite a law he signed in 2019 guaranteeing such back pay.
Officials, local leaders outline what shutdown means for Nevada

Chief Deputy Comptroller Andrew Schaufele told lawmakers last week that a shutdown could cost the state $700,000 per day in lost tax revenue.
Democratic Gov. Wes Moore pledged to continue funding some federal programs, but said the state would not tap into its rainy day funds to do so.
“We’re going to continually evaluate how long we can go,” he said at a news conference.
As for getting repaid, Moore spokesperson David Turner told Stateline that the state had received no indication that the federal government would deviate from past practice, “but we are monitoring closely.”
This fiscal uncertainty hits states as they are already struggling to respond to the strain of federal agency layoffs and cuts in the major tax and spending law Trump signed this summer. The law slashed billions in social service funding and created costly new bureaucratic burdens for states, which administer Medicaid and food assistance programs.
“There’s no way, really at this point, to sort of assess with any level of confidence what’s going to happen when you also have these massive layoffs that were going on pre-shutdown,” said Lisa Parshall, a professor of political science at Daemen University in New York. “There’s just a real sense from states and localities — and I think rightly so — that that kind of reliability of the federal government is now in question.”
It may not be a question of whether states are reimbursed for their shutdown expenses, but which states are reimbursed, Parshall said. The Trump administration has publicly targeted funding of liberal-led states and cities over policy disagreements, raising the possibility it could do something similar with the shutdown.
“Whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, you know, you could argue,” she said. “But it’s definitely a thing that seems to be adding to this level of uncertainty — this shutdown feels different.”
In California, officials just closed a nearly $12 billion shortfall when negotiating the budget that was approved in June. The budget deficit is expected to grow to more than $17 billion next year, said H.D. Palmer, spokesperson for the State of California Department of Finance, which advises the governor and state agencies on budget issues.
“There isn’t a long-term, open-ended line of credit available if this drags out,” he said of the federal government shutdown.
The depth of reserve funds available varies by federally funded program, he said. CalFresh, California’s name for its Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, has enough funds to cover food stamp benefits for this month, but anything beyond that is uncertain.
“If the duration of this is in the matter of days, it will be an inconvenience, but should not pose a massive problem,” he said. “However, if it does drag out for an extended period of time, then clearly it’s going to be a problem.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutdown-McHenry.jpg,,,2025-10-09 08:57:02.364206

Mikie Sherrill (D) not only claimed opponent Jack Ciattarelli (R) profited off the opioid crisis — she claimed he killed tens of thousands.,"Gubernatorial hopefuls Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) debate at the New Brunswick Performing Arts Center on Oct. 8, 2025. (Screenshot courtesy of WABC)NEW BRUNSWICK — Mikie Sherrill went in for the kill Wednesday night by accusing Jack Ciattarelli of being a killer.
The shocking moment came about 40 minutes into the final gubernatorial debate between Sherrill, a congresswoman and Democrat, and Ciattarelli, a Republican trying for the third time to make it to Drumthwacket.
A moderator had just asked the would-be governors how they would bring jobs to New Jersey. Sherrill used her answer to question Ciattarelli’s bona fides as a businessman and claim he made millions publishing propaganda for the opioid industry. And then:
“I think you’re trying to divert from the fact that you killed tens of thousands of people by printing your misinformation, your propaganda,” Sherrill said to him. “Families across this state deserve to know more about that.”
Four weeks left in NJ’s rough-and-tumble race for governor

It’s not quite the first time this type of accusation has been lobbed during a New Jersey gubernatorial debate — just four years ago, Ciattarelli laid responsibility for nursing home deaths during the pandemic at Gov. Phil Murphy’s feet — but the personal nature of the allegation was stunning. I asked Ciattarelli about it after the debate.
“Another desperate tactic by a desperate campaign on behalf of a desperate candidate. It’s a lie,” he said.
Some of Sherrill’s accusations appear related to a 2021 Star Ledger story by Ted Sherman about Ciattarelli’s medical publishing firm, which published material for medical professionals licensed and accredited by the University of Tennessee and funded with grants from the pharmaceutical industry. One of those pieces said the risk of opioid misuse is low among patients with chronic pain but no preexisting substance abuse disorders. Ciattarelli sold the firm in 2017.
Another part of Sherrill’s claim is that Ciattarelli helped develop an app “so that people who were addicted could more easily get access to opioids.” Ciattarelli’s company did indeed team up with a company called ProPatient in 2016 to establish what it called an “innovative, responsive online resource” called Living with Pain that offered to help patients suffering from chronic pain “engage my care team when I feel they are reluctant to help.”
Still, Sherrill’s on-air accusation was not just that Ciattarelli was in bed with opioid manufacturers or that Ciattarelli helped get more people addicted to deadly opioids. Her overall claim, which she made twice, was that Jack Ciattarelli killed tens of thousands of people. I’m struggling to think of a more inflammatory, irresponsible allegation aired during a political debate.
After the sparring session, Sherrill defended her remarks to reporters.
“I think he’s responsible for publicizing the propaganda from opioid companies when he was saying opioids were safe and the publishing company was saying they were safe and people were dying,” she said.
I wish she had stopped there. That claim is more defensible than the one that Ciattarelli killed tens of thousands of New Jerseyans, including children, via his medical publishing company.
Last weekend, the race to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy (D) entered silly season when Ciattarelli’s campaign clipped a Sherrill interview to make it sound like she doesn’t like pork roll. On Wednesday night, I fear, we entered a far more dangerous stage of the campaign. I worry about what comes next.

In troubling times like these, I would hope to see our elected leaders support civil servants.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ella Shaffer: Gov. Phil Scott’s return-to-office policy will hurt our public servants.","This commentary is by Ella Shaffer, of Johnson. Shaffer works in the Department of Vermont Health Access. Her commentary does not reflect the opinion of her employer.


Just before Labor Day weekend, state workers received a memo informing of the governor’s intent to erode labor rights by having employees return to office a minimum of three days per week. Whether this timing was intentional or simply poorly thought out, the optics are not lost on me. Communications from senior leadership thus far surrounding this change have only felt like further cheapshots to the gut. The secretary of administration sends updates about office camaraderie and mentoring colleagues, about small talk in the hallways and personal connections. 
In a video sent to all employees, Scott himself waxes on about the connection to our community that the office brings, as if at the office we aren’t siloed into cubicles behind locked doors. I can’t help but wonder if those who are making this decision have worked in an average office since the Covid-19 pandemic. They seem to imagine an office as some out-of-touch reality, aspiring to recreate something reminiscent of an ’80s sitcom watercooler. Our world has changed, and the way we work has adapted with it, though our leadership fails to follow the trend.

My department conducts an annual employee engagement survey. Routinely, we see remote work as a top benefit enjoyed by employees. It affords a work-life balance we are privileged to have and one I personally would fight for all workers to enjoy whenever able. To this end, my department recently consolidated employees from multiple buildings into one space and moved to an even more remote schedule. I’m not sure that we will all fit in the remaining space with the new proposed schedule, and I’m not sure the governor’s office has considered this. In fact, the Scott administration has not consulted our department leadership at all — at least, from what I understand.
Despite this more remote schedule, my team is more collaborative than ever. We meet twice weekly on morning check-in calls to discuss the week. We share nature pictures and family stories via email. We discuss weekend plans and share inspirational quotes every Friday. On our office days, we get lunch together (a potluck or takeout from somewhere local) and play games while eating. Our commissioner hosts office hours and town halls to field questions, and our admin staff prepares newsletters of local events, farmer’s markets, and tips for well-being. This is what modern connection and collaboration looks like. In the years since the pandemic, we have totally transformed to thrive in this remote environment and our culture is stronger than ever. Unfortunately for us, the culture we have created does not involve the hallway chitchat nor the copy-room small talk that the governor and secretary of state so desire. 
The past few months have been tough. We’ve seen the erosion of civil rights nationally, the decimation of federal career civil servants and the financial strain of mindless tariffs. As a state employee, it is a struggle to focus some days when everything in the news is so bleak. How do you go on with the day-to-day when it feels like the world is crumbling? We are looking down the barrel of massive funding cuts in the coming years, and still our sole focus is to continue to help Vermonters. I can’t shake the feeling that these budget cuts are the impetus for this all.
Scott’s order to limit remote work will only serve to burn us out further. To spend hours more commuting, paying for gas and car maintenance; to find childcare or eldercare; to spend more on take-out meals — all just to sit in an office staring at the same screen we’d be staring at at home. We’ll sit in the office and video chat. We’ll continue to receive voicemails. Send emails. Review medical documentation, sent to us digitally. We will do all the same work that was done previously, but we’ll be more tired from it. More run ragged. More irate. Service will suffer. We’re already short-staffed; my colleagues who live far from the office may look for other opportunities, and any potential new hires will have fewer incentives to join our team. 
Scott’s proposed policy feels like a slap in the face. He suggests that we are missing something that only in-person work can provide, yet neglects to share data backing this up. In troubling times like these, I would hope to see our elected leaders support civil servants. I would hope to see them stand up for Vermonters. I would hope to see them plant our flag and defend our own. Because I’ve seen the alternative, like what has happened to the federal workforce, and I am afraid that it will catch us here, too. If they won’t stand up for us now, will they stand up for us when worse comes knocking? Perhaps the governor should focus less on sending our state workers into disarray and more on protecting Vermont from what is playing out on the federal stage.

Bob Ferguson celebrated the state’s award of a $715 million contract for three hybrid electric ferries in July as a milestone in his drive to improve the nation’s largest ferry system.
But under that contract, Washington State Ferries riders will wait a year longer than planned for a new plug-in vessel to bring some relief to the stressed-out system.
That’s because in exchange for a bid that was hundreds of millions of dollars less than a local competitor, the Florida-based firm Ferguson selected will have until 2030 to deliver the first of the three ferries. 
Washington State Ferries urgently needs new boats to improve its reliability and restore service to pre-pandemic levels. This is the first time in more than 50 years that Washington has turned to an out-of-state shipbuilder to procure new car ferries.
The state specified, as part of the bid terms, that the first boat arrive in 2029. But the final ferry construction contract shows Eastern Shipbuilding got changes to deliver the first boat in August 2030, the second boat by August 2031, and a third the following year. 
‘Cost savings outweighed the longer schedule’
The decision to prioritize taxpayer savings over faster delivery was glossed over in the summer. The governor made the final call on the contract award.
“Eastern Shipbuilding’s bid came in tens of millions of dollars lower than the competing bid per vessel, though they asked for an additional 12 months beyond the original 48-month timeline,” ferry system spokesperson Kurt Workman explained via email. 
“We believe their request reflects a realistic timeline for them to deliver the first ferry,” Workman added. “After an extensive evaluation process, we determined the cost savings outweighed the longer schedule and awarded the contract to Eastern.”
Eastern Shipbuilding declined to answer specific questions about why it wanted five years to complete the first ferry. Instead, the company emailed a one-paragraph statement from its CEO, Joey D’Isernia.
“Over the past 50 years, we have delivered more than 350 highly complex vessels with a 99% on-schedule rate,” D’Isernia said. “Our proposal for the Washington State Ferries was based on decades of experience building ships with similar requirements and levels of complexity, making it realistic in both cost and schedule.”

Only one other shipyard, Nichols Brothers, bid to construct the new plug-in hybrid ferries, each capable of carrying up to 160 cars and 1,500 passengers. The Whidbey Island and Everett-based shipyard’s total bid for three vessels was more than $350 million higher than Eastern’s.
Gavin Higgins, chief executive officer of Nichols Brothers, said their submission met the state’s four-year delivery timeline for the first vessel. “The need for speed to get these delivered was a huge issue” for the state, he recalled.
“We bid to the specifications. We didn’t know anything about the added year until I got a call to let me know we weren’t getting the bid,” he said. 
At one point earlier this year, Nichols Brothers and a range of allies from around the north Puget Sound lobbied the governor unsuccessfully to split the contract for the new ferries to secure local jobs and boost the region’s shipbuilding industry.
Frequent ferry riders such as Amy Drayer of Vashon Island have already steeled themselves for news about delivery delays, given the newness of the hybrid electric propulsion system the state chose. Drayer sits on the steering committee of Islanders for Ferry Action.
“We would not be surprised if the delivery schedule slips even further,” she said dolefully. “We’re building something brand new. Any time you build something new, there’s a learning curve.”
Washington inducted its first plug-in ferry into its fleet this past summer when the Vigor Seattle shipyard completed a conversion of the diesel ferry Wenatchee to hybrid electric propulsion. 
That project went way over budget, was completed nearly a year late, and the boat has had mechanical issues since entering service, which might be a reason Washington State Ferries was open to allowing additional time for delivery of the new boats.
Drayer said she does not accept the time versus money framing of the decision.
“If it were time versus money, we’d be ordering clean diesel engines” for the new ferries, Drayer said before adding that her group isn’t advocating to reopen the ferry design at this point.
Hurricane risks 
Eastern Shipbuilding also requested a grace period in case a hurricane damages its Florida Panhandle facilities while the new ferries are under construction.
The revised contract terms that Washington accepted suspend late delivery penalties in the event of a hurricane. Otherwise, Eastern Shipbuilding could be penalized $7,500 per day for every day past the agreed delivery deadlines, escalating to $15,000 per day if a delay extends beyond three months.
Eastern Shipbuilding experienced significant damage in 2018 during Hurricane Michael. At the time, the shipbuilder was under contract to build three new ferries for the Staten Island line in New York. 
According to the Staten Island Advance, the three 4,500-passenger Staten Island ferries were each delivered more than a year late due to delays attributed to the hurricane and then COVID-19.
Higher price, added uncertainty
Washington State Ferries currently has 21 vessels of various sizes and ages in its fleet. The agency’s long-range plan is to grow to 26 ferries to provide reliable service on every route, with allowances for maintenance tie-ups and a vessel in reserve. 
The agency tentatively plans to deploy its new ferries to the Mukilteo-Clinton run first, probably followed by the Seattle-Bremerton route.
On the new ferries, the center of the ship’s hold will be packed with racks of water-cooled rechargeable batteries so each ferry can sail fully on electric power most of the time. The engine room will also feature twin diesel generators as a backup source of propulsion. 
Assuming they use green electricity to recharge at the terminals, the new ferries should achieve a large reduction in fuel consumption and an associated reduction in global warming emissions.
The state’s target is to convert six existing vessels to hybrid-electric power and build 16 new plug-in boats — all by 2040. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have voiced doubts this year about whether this timeline will be affordable or achievable.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/P1000998-Broken-down-ferry-Tillikum-being-pushed-to-Anacortes-1024x638.jpg,,,2025-10-09 07:57:32.381064

(Photo by Chad Davis/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota law enforcement agencies seized and kept over $6 million in cash, vehicles and other property in 2024, according to the state auditor’s most recent asset forfeiture report. That’s 14% more than in 2023.
The Minneapolis Police Department netted almost three times as much — $469,566 compared to $157,375 — from state forfeitures in 2024 compared to 2023.
In many cases, Minnesota law enforcement agencies took the valuables from people who had yet to be convicted of a crime but are suspected of a crime, which is legal under current law.
The American Civil Liberties Union and libertarian organization Institute for Justice say the practice incentivizes “policing for profit” because agencies keep proceeds from forfeitures. Meanwhile, the prohibitively expensive process of challenging an asset seizure typically means the person walks away.
Case in point: In 2024, over 88% of the two most common types of forfeitures — those relating to DUI and controlled substance cases — proceeded without legal dispute, according to the auditor’s report. In other words, the vast majority of Minnesotans who get their property seized walk away from their property instead of challenging a forfeiture.
Among the more notorious instances of forfeiture abuse in recent Minnesota history was the Metro Gang Strike Force, a Twin Cities law enforcement unit that shut down in 2009 after investigations revealed they were illegally seizing property to take home or even use to fund a trip to Hawaii. The scandal spurred major forfeiture reform in 2010 that expanded reporting requirements, among other measures, though the total value of forfeitures continued to rise for years after.


More recently, a 2021 forfeiture reform further strengthened reporting requirements and prohibited law enforcement agencies from seizing less than $1,500 in cash — unless there’s probable cause to believe the money was involved in buying drugs.
Forfeitures pursued through state law have dropped significantly since the 2021 reform, from nearly $11 million in 2021 to $5.5 million in 2024.
“The bipartisan forfeiture legislation passed in 2021 is doing what it was meant to do — restore civil liberties and focus on the most serious cases,” Auditor Julie Blaha said in a release.
Through “equitable sharing,” however, state agencies can receive money from federal forfeitures that they participate in. And those forfeitures have increased from 2023.
The 2021 state reform also expanded what agencies had to report on how they spend their forfeiture money, though the expenditure categories are broad. For example, the Minneapolis Police Department spent over $500,000 of their 2024 forfeitures on “capital expenditures,” which a spokesperson said in an email was used to buy two vehicles, a 2024 Chevrolet Suburban and a 2024 Ford Transit 350 Cargo Van.


The ACLU and the Institute for Justice advocate replacing civil and criminal forfeitures with a single criminal forfeiture process, where forfeiture would be part of a criminal conviction. Institute for Justice published a study showing that getting rid of civil forfeiture in New Mexico didn’t increase crime, as law enforcement said it would.
Kelsey O’Callaghan published a recent Mitchell Hamline law review article showing that civil forfeitures disproportionately target communities of color in South Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and other states. Minnesota does not currently collect demographic information on forfeitures.
“I think [criminal forfeiture is] a way better way to go about forfeiture so that we’re not infringing upon people’s due process and constitutional rights,” O’Callaghan told the Reformer.
The 2021 Minnesota reform did not address the underlying problem — that the majority of Minnesotans walk away from their property without engaging in the legal process, said Lee McGrath, a retired attorney formerly at the Institute for Justice.
One reason they walk away: People can only get access to a public defender for criminal cases — not civil cases.
“You have a problem with access to justice issues because the dollar amounts are important to the individual but too small to invest or expend to hire a lawyer to help you get back,” McGrath said.
The Minnesota County Attorney’s Association maintains that getting rid of civil forfeitures altogether would be a mistake. Bob Small, who was part of the 2021 reform working group, said that civil forfeiture upholds due process rights as is: “There’s plenty of notice and there’s plenty of opportunity to be heard.”
The issue crosses party lines: The 2021 reform included both Republican and Democrat lawmakers as authors, which is becoming atypical for contentious issues at the polarized Legislature.
“If gridlock is going to be the name of the game in the next few years, I think the profile of  forfeiture reform will rise as one of the few issues that can actually move,” said Munira Mohamed, a policy associate at the ACLU.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MPD-Off-Duty-davis2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-09 06:59:35.118757

“We shouldn’t have to spend taxpayer dollars fixing the telecoms’ problems,” he said. “It’s time for some oversight that puts everyone on the same playing field.”
“The problem is with the telecoms,” Barnett added. “They need standards and oversight.”
Davis, who authored House Bill 1480 earlier this year, said she filed the measure at Barnett’s request to establish “minimum standards for the installation and maintenance of communication service or utility service facilities in a public right-of-way.” The bill received a House hearing but no vote.
“Now that you know about it,” Davis told the panel, “you see it everywhere.”
Locals ask for more oversight
Earlier this year, during the 2025 session, lawmakers negotiated a separate compromise over pole-attachment rules aimed at accelerating broadband access. That earlier discourse pitted investor-owned utilities against telecom providers over who controls space on poles and how much they can charge.
Lawmakers suggested on Wednesday that the state could still revisit the issue from another angle — this time focused on what happens after those lines are installed.

Barnett’s slideshow showed photographs of hanging bundles and broken outdoor telecom cabinets. He described a five-year ordeal to get one abandoned communications cabinet removed and said telecom mergers make it even harder to identify which company is responsible.
“When a provider buys another provider, there is a lack of responsibility and liability for transactions,” he said.
Wells County Surveyor Jarrod Hahn, president of the County Surveyors Association, separately told lawmakers that problems with abandoned utilities are not limited to cities and towns, but are also common in rural areas. 
“The short answer to the question of, ‘Do underground abandoned utilities cause problems?’ The short answer to that is, yes, they do,” Hahn said.
He described how generations of infrastructure — ranging from old oil field pipes to drainage tiles and telecom cables — have been left in the ground, often with no records. 
“We are just as guilty at local government of putting in new infrastructure and leaving the old in place,” Hahn said.
He emphasized, too, the difficulty of tracking what’s underground, especially as companies change hands and records are lost.
“With the larger telecom companies, they subcontract their locating. Those locators probably do not have access to that historical knowledge. All they have is the map of what’s currently being used,” Hahn said. “Underground, out of sight, out of mind — nobody knows what’s buried below the ground.”
Telecom industry pushes back
Lawmakers from both parties sympathized but split on whether state or local governments should intervene. Currently, oversight falls largely to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.
Committee Chair Sen. Rick Niemeyer, R-Lowell, said he preferred local solutions. 
“You have the ability, if you have a communication company that comes in, to deny him a permit [because of] their past work,” he said. “I’m not looking to bring the state in on anything, unless we need to.”
Others, including Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, said local ordinances are no substitute for consistent statewide rules. 
“It would only be prudent for the state to have some kind of requirement and penalties,” Taylor said, suggesting identifiers on each line so city and town officials can determine ownership.

Representatives for AT&T and Comcast spoke later in the hearing, arguing against new state mandates. 
Steve Rogers, a lobbyist for AT&T, cautioned that statewide rules could duplicate existing federal or IURC oversight and slow broadband expansion. 
Rogers pushed back on the idea that problems with abandoned cables and utility oversight are widespread or indicative of a “wild west” environment across Indiana.
He told lawmakers that broadband expansion already faces “complex federal and IURC oversight” and that additional rules could “slow down investment and deployment.”
“If [Barnett’s] experience was typical, I would know it. You would know it. … You’d have mayors lined up out the door,” Rogers said. “That is not the way that it usually works. The way that it usually works is they call the provider. The provider comes in. We resolve the issue, we move on. If we don’t, they stop issuing permits. And the minute you tell somebody they can’t build their network, you’d be amazed how responsive they become.”
He also warned against giving hundreds of municipalities broad new regulatory authority, saying it would create “huge bureaucracies” and drive up costs for customers.
“We are subject to the National Electric Safety Code. We’re subject to 811, ‘Call Before You Dig Regulations.’ We’re subject to FCC pole attachment regulations,” Rogers said. “The idea that there are no rules and we need to give cities and towns the ability to fine people — that is just not the case.”
‘Last time we hear of this’: Panel strikes utility pole compromise to boost Indiana broadband access

He additionally addressed the issue of abandoned cable, noting the difficulty of defining what’s actually abandoned and the need for flexibility in network management.
“I don’t know how you regulate abandoned cable, because somebody’s definition of what’s abandoned is going to be different from another person’s,” Rogers argued.
He explained that extra capacity is often built into networks, and that removing unused lines every time a customer cancels service would be inefficient.
“We would rather put our money towards capital investment in building fiber networks than things that don’t provide service to customers,” he added.
Joni Hart, representing Comcast, echoed those concerns, telling the committee the company already works with local governments to address safety issues and that additional regulation could “discourage investment” in fiber projects.
She said most providers respond quickly when notified of damaged or hanging lines and urged lawmakers to “avoid one-size-fits-all mandates.”
Hart emphasized the complexity of broadband deployment, which often requires working across “multiple jurisdictions, multiple pole owners,” and sometimes crossing “30 counties to do a line across the state.” She pushed back on the idea that companies are intentionally skirting permit requirements.
“We spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in Indiana on getting permits, expediting permits, making sure that we’re getting that process correct and the man hours to go with that,” Hart maintained.
While “it hasn’t always been the case,” she said Comcast now marks its aerial cables at installation. For older lines that “may or may not be” marked, Hart said the company actively adds tags during maintenance or when issues arise.
“We want to be a good community partner with these areas,” Hart said. “We want to be focusing both on deployment and being a responsible community partner.”

DemasThe Michigan Immigrant Rights Center presented oral arguments to the Michigan Supreme Court on Wednesday in a case that they are bringing against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for her policy to deny worker’s compensation to undocumented immigrants who are injured while on the job. Whitmer’s lawyers also presented their arguments in response, and both sides faced questions from justices. 
Those questions largely centered on the procedural questions that have come front and center in this case — whether Whitmer should be granted immunity in her official capacity as governor, and whether the case should not be considered timely as it was filed over a year after the governor’s lawyers say the “harms” began. 
The case specifically argues that the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center has been harmed by the policy, as opposed to arguing the rights of the individual undocumented workers — which is central to those procedural questions. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The argument presented by David Muraskin, representing the center, focused on three arguments. First, he said, “the governor cannot assert sovereign immunity against this case.”
“It is the providence of this court and the courts of Michigan to say what the law is in our tripartite system of government, that means the courts can always order government officials to comply with the law going forward,” he continued. His other arguments stated that, because the claim is about protecting forward-looking rights, the timing limitation of a year is irrelevant, and that the governor is not in this case as the state, but is an individual officer of the state. 
In a press conference prior to the oral arguments, Muraskin described this lawsuit as a question of Michiganders’ ability to take their government to court over perceived wrongs. 
“That would mean that when the governor has a policy of any unconstitutional conduct, including this one, the fact that she got away with it for a year would keep anyone from ever going to court,” he said. 
Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh posed a question to Muraskin about why the governor should not be considered as the state for the sake of the case — which would protect her from this litigation. 
“An officer who is acting unconstitutionally unlawfully cannot be the state. And so to the extent she is acting unlawfully, and she is with this policy, she is responsible for that” Muraskin responded.
Gallant Fish, the attorney for the governor, argued that two statutes in Michigan law — one of which specifically sets that one-year time limit on cases against the state — do apply to Whitmer in this litigation in her role as the governor. 
Fish was asked by Justice Elizabeth Welch how to determine when that one-year time frame would end, as the policy denying this compensation is still in place. He contended that it was not an ongoing harm to the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, but instead a single wrong alleged against them in a 2023 Court of Appeals decision. 
Fish responded similarly to a question from Justice Noah Hood, arguing that the harms in question were not the repeated denials of benefits to undocumented workers, but the specific impact of the governor’s policy on the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. 
Following oral arguments, the justices concluded their questioning, with a ruling expected in the coming months.

Analysis shows losses on four principal Arkansas crops
Farmers face higher labor, fertilizer, interest costs
Analysis available as MP588, “State of the Arkansas Crop Economy in 2025” 



Arkansas farmers will lose hundreds of dollars per acre this year for their corn, cotton, long grain rice and soybean crops, according to an analysis by extension economists with the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.
The analysis, “The State of the Arkansas Crop Economy in 2025,” conducted by Hunter Biram, Ryan Loy and Scott Stiles, examined net returns on the state’s principal crops. They factored in expected yield, expected price, expected revenues, operating costs and rent.










The agricultural economy right now is probably in one of the most depressing states that I've seen in my career.


– Deacue Fields, vice president-agriculture, University of Arkansas System


They found that Arkansas farmers can expect losses of:

$273.71 per acre for corn
$352.75 per acre for cotton
$258.84 per acre for long grain rice
$85.02 per acre for soybeans.

“The agricultural economy right now is probably in one of the most depressing states that I’ve seen in my career,” Deacue Fields, vice president-agriculture, for the University of Arkansas System, said to the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees. In addition to leading the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture, Fields is an agricultural economist.
“No matter what the yields, the prices are so low and expenses so high,” he said. “We had record yields in 2024, and farmers still lost money. You can’t yield your way into profitability this year.”

Abundant yield
Stiles agreed completely.
“Row crop economics are particularly challenged right now,” he said. “In what looks to be a third consecutive year of losses, growers are not in a good financial position.”
Working against growers are ample supplies of all commodities, which “are placing downward pressure on crop prices,” Stiles said. “We expect to see a record corn crop in the U.S. this fall.  Although other major crops will be short of record production, domestic stocks will be comfortable.
“In addition, there was record corn, cotton, rice and soybean production in South America this year,” he said. “This is another factor pressuring the 2025 and 2026 price outlook.”
Prospects for help
“The profitability challenges in the row crop sector have now spread from the Mid-South into the Midwest,” Stiles said.
“With farmer angst increasing across the country, the Trump administration is exploring initiatives to ramp up aid,” he said “Part of these initiatives include a look into rising input costs. Also, there has been recent discussion around direct farmer subsidies through redistribution of tariff revenues.”
Biram said that “ad hoc disaster assistance has helped to keep farm incomes stable in the past, like during COVID and the Russia-Ukraine war.
“However, with input expenses remaining elevated despite falling income from crop farming, current disaster assistance through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, or ECAP,  and the Supplemental Disaster Assistance Program, or SDRP, will not be enough to fully close the gap in multiyear declines in net farm income,” Biram said.
The cost of farming
Stiles said input costs are another concern.
“Fertilizers have trended higher for most of this year,” he said. “Phosphates have been particularly strong, with affordability at record lows for U.S. farmers.”
Fertilizer expense has remained elevated since 2022, largely driven by increased fertilizer prices resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. After a $70 million, or 15 percent, increase in 2021 and a $110 million, or 20 percent increase in 2023, seed expenses have remained elevated. This is despite a decline of $16 million, or 2 percent, in 2025 compared to 2023 and a modest $9 million or 1 percent increase in 2025.
“Seed prices continue to rise. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has seed price up approximately 25 percent since 2020,” Stiles said.
Labor expense is set to reach a record $413 million in 2025 with increases averaging $29 million, or 9 percent since 2021. Interest expense will be back to 2023 levels with a year-over-year decline of $23 million driven by relatively lower interest rates.
However, interest expense has increased $182 million or 46 percent since the increases in the Effective Federal Funds Rate since April 2022.
Despite the Sept. 17 cut in interest rates by the Federal Open Market Committee to an effective rate of 4.09 percent, “interest expenses still represent a significant cost that is continuing to price-squeeze farmers,” said Loy.
“Based on estimates derived from the 2025 long grain rice enterprise budgets, per-acre interest expenses are, on average, $15 higher than in 2021,” he said. “Assuming a 500-acre farm, this interest cost amounts to roughly $7,500 in additional expenses. This price squeeze hinders a farmer’s profit, impacting the health of rural economies that rely on agriculture.”
While rental expense, consisting of 8 percent of production expenses less feed and livestock purchases, fell to $541 million from $563 million in 2024 and $556 million in 2023, Loy said it was likely driven by declines in the value of crop production with most tenant farmers operating under a crop share agreement.

Weakened buying power
The analysis also noted the weakening purchasing power of the crop dollar. In looking at monthly crop price indices from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, going back to 2011, the report explains a widening gap between crop prices and input costs.
“Crop prices relative to input prices have declined, and the spread between the indices continued to widen from the 2014 Farm Bill until the pandemic in 2020,” the analysis states. “Crop prices did spike in 2022-23 due to supply chain disruptions, and since the same supply chains carry fertilizer, input prices also spiked, ultimately negating the benefits of higher crop prices.”
The gap between these two measures is the greatest it has been in at least 25 years, “underscoring the rarity and severity of the economic conditions faced by agricultural producers in 2025,” the authors wrote.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
This is the second of three articles about Michigan communities organizing to stop the construction of energy-intensive computing facilities. 
Early this year, Augusta Charter Township resident Travis Matts had seen a few headlines about the problems data centers caused in towns across the country. He thought the impacts on water, air and utility bills sounded awful, but it also seemed like a far-away issue.
Until it suddenly hit home in May.
That is when Matts learned, through his group of volunteers that cleans up area litter, that a data center was proposed for an 822-acre property largely in Augusta Township, a small farming community southeast of Ann Arbor. Township leadership fully supported it.
Matts and others responded by quickly forming a new residents group in opposition, and began collecting ballot initiative signatures to put a rezoning for the data center in front of voters. The debate consumed local politics and bitterly divided some residents in this town of about 8,000 people, leading to accusations of harassment and threats.
“It’s sad that we residents have to fight as hard as we do to keep these facilities out of our backyards, but if we don’t then who will?” he asked. “We’re taking it into our own hands.”
By August, the group, Protect Augusta Charter Township (PACT), had collected enough signatures for a referendum, and PACT is confident residents will vote the project down, Matts added.
The grassroots effort is part of a growing number of municipal fights that are playing out in towns throughout Michigan—and across the U.S.—that could derail data center plans. The centers are opposed by people from across the political spectrum, and the controversy here is unfolding as neighboring Saline Township rejected a similar data center plan in September.
In Augusta Township, the proposal has pitted nearly 1,000 residents who signed the ballot initiative against the township Board of Trustees, which in July unanimously approved the rezoning, and the developer behind the proposal, New York City-based real estate firm Thor Equities.
Thor builds data centers but has not announced a client, though a planning report noted tech companies like Google and Microsoft use the type of facility that is proposed here. The centers typically house infrastructure for artificial intelligence and other computing uses.
Few details on how the center would look are yet available, but it would include at least five large buildings on what is currently farmland and wetlands, according to plans. The center may consume 1 million gallons of water daily, local news outlet MLive reported, and would include large generators.
The Board of Trustees and supporters point to potential benefits, including increased tax revenue for the financially struggling township, and water and sewer infrastructure improvements.
“It would just be so huge for us,” said Augusta Township Clerk Kim Gonczy. The level of tax revenue is still unclear, she said, but added it is likely “millions of dollars.”
“It could make such a big difference for the township,” she added.
The project’s opponents questioned the economic impact. They fear an increase in noise and light pollution, and that the massive facility would destroy Augusta’s rural character while pushing up utility bills and causing brownouts. PACT’s effort is about preserving the “sense of place,” said Matts, whose family has lived in Augusta for 100 years.
“With this data center plan they’re basically saying, ‘We know that, but business is more important,’” Matts said. “Landscape and preserving the identity of a place does not register on their needs list.”
Residents needed to collect 561 signatures to get the issue on the ballot, and they turned in 957 gathered during an approximately two-week period in August. Township officials must certify the signatures, then develop language for the ballot that will be voted on during a special election in May 2026 at the earliest. Matts estimated PACT spoke with 1,200 to 1,400 residents, and a strong majority signed the petition.
As data centers’ financial and environmental tolls have become clearer, the public is broadly growing more concerned. In many communities, their massive electricity and water consumption has increased residential utility bills.
In Michigan and elsewhere, they have already required more fossil fuel plants to be built or stay open, and threaten to derail the transition to clean energy. Meanwhile, they can be a source of light, noise, water and air pollution.
The local battles playing out across the state are residents’ best line of defense, said Tim Minotas, legislative coordinator for the Sierra Club of Michigan.
“This is where people live and raise their family so in the absence of state or federal protections, it’s really the responsibility of our local communities to take a stand to protect themselves,” Minotas said.
 “That’s Harassment”

An incident detailed in a previous news report and confirmed by four residents to Inside Climate News described how a township official in August allegedly called police on PACT members. PACT had set up a canopy and table on the side of the road to collect signatures for the ballot initiative near the township hall.
The responding officer allegedly found the campaigners had done nothing wrong, but asked them to move the table back from the road. PACT questioned the township’s intent.
“Calling the cops, that’s harassment,” resident Deborah Fuqua-Frey, who is opposed to the project, said during a public comment session after the incident.
Gonczy did not respond to Inside Climate News questions about the incident. In a late-August statement to the news outlet Planet Detroit, Gonczy said the campaigners were set up too close to a dangerous intersection.
Meanwhile, residents said they have received anonymous handwritten notes in their mailboxes that they perceived as threats. Video shows the township supervisor, Todd Waller, would not allow residents to talk about the data center during public comment at board meetings. Some residents questioned the ethics of Waller’s rule, and said it was part of a larger pattern of officials trying to silence the project’s critics. Waller did not respond to requests for comment.
The local issues came after a battle in the state legislature in which progressive legislators sought to add consumer and environmental protections to incentives for data centers. Those were not included in the bills that passed, and may have helped alleviate some of the problems now being dealt with at the local level, said Denise Keele, director of the nonprofit Michigan Climate Action Network.
“It’s one thing if there is NIMBY-ism, and people saying ‘I don’t want this in my community,’ but with data centers the fears are real,” Keele said. “The centers suck up energy and more importantly they will raise our energy rates.”
 Merits and Drawbacks

Township officials have downplayed PACT’s litany of issues with the project. Responding to concerns about light pollution, Gonczy said the property’s lights will be pointed toward the ground, so they won’t flood the surrounding region. She also told Inside Climate News that officials traveled to Toledo to visit a data center, used a noise meter to measure the decibels, and found the level would not violate Augusta Township ordinances.
Moreover, the project would be built in the township’s southwest corner, far away from most residents, Gonczy said. She added that she has not seen any evidence that it would decrease grid reliability or increase bills.
“I don’t understand all of that, and I don’t know where it’s coming from,” Gonczy told Inside Climate News.
The project’s opponents see it differently. They argue that the financial benefit is not worth the cost, and still suspect the lights will be a problem.
“It won’t be dark at night because there are going to be acres and acres of lights,” said one township resident who declined to use her name for fear of retribution. “It’s no longer your dark cornfield because there’s a glow that never goes away.”
The project’s opponents also questioned the accuracy of the sound meter readings, and said those do not take into account the effects of a steady din. Data centers include generators that frequently run on diesel fuel, and those are used monthly as routine maintenance to ensure they work, which could contribute to air and noise pollution.
More important, Matts said, is the loss of the rural character. State leaders didn’t consider these issues, nor has Augusta Township’s Board of Trustees, Matts said, which he called “frustrating.”
“People have lived here for a long time and we understand that things come and go and there’s change and development, but something of this scale and magnitude—1,000 industrial acres—is asinine in a community like this,” Matts said.

Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) speaks at a press conference Wednesday morning about the Senate Democrats' ""Affordable Wisconsin Agenda."" (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)If there’s one word at the top of Democratic Party political discourse this year, it’s “affordability.”
Whether focused on a particular issue — child care, health care and housing are the most frequent examples — or on the cost of just about everything, making goods and services and life “affordable” figures high in the opening pitches of candidates across the state.
“I think the No. 1  issue that we need to focus on is affordability,” said Mitchell Berman, a Racine County nurse, when he announced in August he would seek the  Democratic nomination to challenge Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil in Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District.
Trevor Jung in Racine launched his state Senate campaign in September with a focus on “affordability” and “good-paying jobs.” Corrine Hendrickson, a former child care proprietor in New Glarus, said “affordability” is the top issue for her state Senate bid — and she wasn’t just talking about child care.
Democrats campaigning to be the party’s nominee for governor as diverse as David Crowley, Missy Hughes, and Francesca Hong have all uttered the word in introducing themselves to the public.
On Wednesday, the State Senate Democratic Committee had a press conference outside the Capitol to announce the Democrats’ focus on affordability, both for their upcoming legislative agenda and with an eye on the 2026 elections.
“Right now in Wisconsin, 65% of families are saying they are just getting by or they are struggling,” said Sen. Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton), the Senate minority leader. A spokesperson said the July Marquette University Law School poll was the source for the survey finding.
State Senate Democrats plan to spend the next few weeks traveling Wisconsin and hearing from state residents. Hesselbein said those conversations will become fodder for “tangible policy solutions that will help working families keep more of their hard-earned money, and we’re calling it the Affordable Wisconsin Agenda.”
Nathan Kalmoe, a University of Wisconsin political scientist, said via email that emphasizing poor economic conditions could be risky for Wisconsin Democrats running in state elections. While Republican lawmakers “may take some blame, the governor is a Democrat,” and voters tend to hold the chief executive responsible for economic conditions, he said. 
Kalmoe added that focusing on the economy exclusively at the expense of concerns for the most marginalized or concerns about Trump administration actions that threaten democracy would be “disturbing, and dangerous.”
Nevertheless, polling trends in the last several months suggest why Democrats nationwide have been focusing on inflation and the economy, said John D. Johnson, a research fellow and political analyst at Marquette University.
In Marquette polls shortly after President Donald Trump was elected to a second term in November, and again before he took office in January, 41% of adults nationally said they believed his policies would reduce inflation.
In Marquette’s most recent national poll, conducted in mid-September and released Oct. 2, “that had fallen to 25%,” Johnson said in an email to the Wisconsin Examiner. “Meanwhile, the share believing Trump’s policies would increase inflation grew from 45% to 60%.”
In the September poll, 40% of adults named “inflation and the cost of living” as the top issue in the U.S. “Another 19% chose ‘the economy’ more generally,” Johnson said.
“Overall, 29% of adults approved of Trump’s handling of ‘inflation and the cost of living’ while 71% disapproved,” Johnson said. (On “border security,” meanwhile, 55% of those polled approved Trump while 45% disapproved.)
In May, 68% of Republicans and 23% of independent voters told the Marquette pollsters they approved of how Trump was handling “inflation and the cost of living.” By September, Republican support had slipped to 57%, but among independents, support had plummeted to 14%.
“In other words, this is (1) an issue where there is a lot of daylight between how Republicans and Independents rate Trump, and (2) an issue where Trump is falling with both Democrats and Independents,” Johnson said.
At the Senate Democrats’ news conference Wednesday, a succession of senators — along with one state representative who is a Senate hopeful — spoke of how the issue of affordability cuts across a wide range of topics. And each laid blame for inaction on their Republican rivals.
“Senate Democrats have already been leading the fight to lower the cost of housing, whether trying to expand the homestead tax credit or preventing hedge funds from buying up available housing stocks, but undoubtedly more needs to be done,” said Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick).
Rep. Jenna Jacobson (D-Oregon), who has the endorsement of the Senate Democrats as she seeks the party’s nomination in the 17th Senate District next year, pointed to “reckless federal policies” hitting farmers and hiking grocery bills.
Democratic state lawmakers have proposed a free school meal bill along with grants for farmers who provide food to food pantries, replacing a federal program cut by the Trump administration, she said; both are “examples of some of the kinds of policies that we can advance to lower everyday costs.”
Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) warned of coming spikes both in health insurance costs and in the rates of people without health insurance because of the expiring Affordable Care Act premium subsidies at the center of the federal shutdown fight in Congress. “We need Congress to get to work and renew these ACA subsidies,” she said.
Meanwhile, bills in the state Legislature to lower prescription drug costs and cap the price of asthma medication “haven’t even gotten a public hearing,” Dassler-Alfheim said. “We could be doing more here in Wisconsin to make life a little bit more affordable for everyone.”
Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) said Wisconsin continues to face “a child care crisis,” with too few options for working families. Care is increasingly costly, “not because child care providers are making huge profits,” she said. “It’s because we can no longer underpay those doing the child care work, mostly women.”
Democrats have been pushing for expanding child care support, “yet Republicans in Madison stand in the way every single time,” Keyeski said.
Hesselbein said that the Senate Democrats hope that they can follow up on their conversations with voters across the state by “bringing those ideas back to the state Legislature, working on them and hopefully being able to pass them in a bipartisan manner.”
At the same time, however, she blamed inaction on Republican lawmakers who “are mired in internal conflict, unwilling to cross the aisle and get stuff done for Wisconsinites.” The  2026 election will enable voters to “turn the page,” she said, “and vote for a vision that puts Wisconsinites first, that puts you and your families first.”

(Photo provided by Platt Moore)When Platt Moore and his wife Ashley learned a residential developer had approached a neighboring farm owner about selling their land just outside the fast-growing town of Fountain Inn, the Moores worried what it would mean for their own small ranch to go from prime pastureland to a 400-home subdivision next door.
It seemed to them like the once rural towns on the outskirts of Greenville were raising more houses than beef cattle in the five years they’d been operating, so the couple asked the landowner to sell the roughly 200 acres to them instead.
They turned to a decades-old state grant program aimed at preserving archeological and natural resources in the state.
New SC law aims to preserve dwindling farmland

While perhaps better known for its protection of undeveloped forests, wetlands and historical properties, South Carolina’s Conservation Bank can and has preserved farmland. The agency has safeguarded upwards of 39,000 agricultural acres since it was established 23 years ago, according to budget and program analyst Adair Roark.
But in the last couple years, farmers have been considering it with greater frequency as the cost of farming has risen and development, driven by a growing population, has moved in.
South Carolina has lost about 1,900 farms over the past two decades, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
Forestry and farmland lost to development from 2001 to 2016 totaled more than 280,000 acres, according to a 2022 report by American Farmland Trust titled “Farms Under Threat,” which gave South Carolina the nation’s eighth-worst threat ranking.
‘Exceeded expectations’
These trends prompted the South Carolina Farm Bureau to form a working agriculture focused land trust, which leverages federal, state and local tax credits and dollars to pay farmers to put their land into protective easements, said Executive Director Gary Spires. Under the agreements, the farmers retain ownership of the land and can continue to farm but must limit all future use to agriculture.
In the past two years, the SC Farm Bureau Land Trust has closed on 24 easements statewide, awarding upwards of $9 million for the preservation of 7,400 acres. The organization has four more easements nearing completion and another 20 in consideration, Spires said.
“When we went into this, we started it from scratch,” he said. “It has exceeded expectations.”
In addition, the General Assembly passed legislation to form the Working Farmland Protection Fund, which Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law in March 2024.
The fund, which sits within the state Conservation Bank, sets aside additional money specifically to preserve agricultural land. Legislators put $12 million — $4 million annually plus $8 million in one time funds — in the current budget for the program. That’s up from $3 million in the previous year’s budget year.
To qualify, a landowner must generate at least 50% of their income from agriculture. The land also must be under threat of development, have value as a natural resource, and be located in or selling agriculture to poor, rural and minority communities.

In the last budget cycle, the program funded five easements covering about 1,770 acres across six counties. And the bank had more eligible applicants than it had available funds, said Executive Director Raleigh West. In those cases, the bank’s governing board still has the option to pull from general Conservation Bank funds.
Now, the more than 2,000-acre Lone Star Plantation near St. Matthews is in line to be the sixth to fall under the program, according to documents filed with a legislative financial oversight panel. The Conservation Bank plans to offer Larry Doyle and his family a $2 million easement.
Part of a former hunting preserve, the Doyles use a majority of the property to grow corn, soybeans, cotton and peanuts. The remainder is timber land and wildlife habitat, including 93 acres of ponds, wetlands and creeks that flow into the Congaree River and attract waterfowl, bobwhites and white-tailed deer.
Doyle retired from the Farm Credit industry four years ago and began farming full time.
“Had we not had this (Working Farmland Protection Fund) we probably could not have done this deal,” said Michael McShane, chairman of the Conservation Bank Board.
These are properties that could easily be turned into a field full of solar panels or an Amazon distribution center, McShane added.
“It would be a real loss to our state to see these lands converted over to other uses like that,” he said.
‘Able to make a living’
Spires thinks that farmers’ familiarity with the state Farm Bureau has led more people who hadn’t considered an easement before to look into it. That includes the Moores, who are in line for $1.5 million easement.
Platt Moore had experience with a conservation easement on a piece of hunting property he co-owned near the Congaree swamp, which he said came with a lot of restrictions. So when his real estate agent mentioned an agriculture easement, he was apprehensive at first.
But in working with farmers, the program allows them to carve out parts of their property in case they need it for a barn, grain bin, shop or other use in the future. That was important to the Moores, who said they may eventually add a horseback riding program or other ag-related tourism to their existing grass-fed beef and butchering operations.
Between bad weather and trade policy with China, farmers and ranchers face tight margins, Spires said.
SC Ports rallies to help soybean farmers, but future remains uncertain

“The last two growing seasons prices started tumbling while costs skyrocketed,” he said. “Now the tariff situation is making things even worse.”
“These are often multi-generational properties and people who want to farm but they have got to be able to make a living,” Spires added.
Tax deductions that conservation easements bring are important, he said, but even more so is the cash associated with these deals. Those who participate often pour that money back into their businesses.
‘Tougher every day’
Moore grew up on a 1,500 acre farm in Williamsburg County. He said back when he turned 17 he left the farm to go work in the environmental industry with no plans to return to agriculture.
Now, at age 58, he wants his four children to be able to grow up in a rural setting, prompting him and his wife to buy their small farm in the Upstate.
Moore thinks the conservation easement program is a good option for anyone in agriculture theses days and has started recommending it to his neighbors.
“Land prices are so expensive these days,” he said. “The barriers to entry are getting tougher every day.”
The family the Moores acquired their additional acres from had long moved away and leased it to a man who used it to graze cattle. Knowing they wouldn’t return to farming themselves, the family chose to sell so they’d have money to pass own to their own children and grandchildren.
The man who had been leasing the land was able to combine his herd with that of his son, who has a large cattle ranch in the Upstate.
“And we were able to expand our operations,” Moore said.
Not only do to Moores support themselves through raising cattle, they also own multiple retail stores that support 70 other local vendors, who sell items including free range chicken, pork, elderberry jam and honey.
Now, even if they end up surrounded by neighborhoods, 420 acres of the Moores’ property will remain farmland in perpetuity.
“It’s a win for us and a win for conservation at the same time,” Moore said.

Mark Pocan (D-Black Earth) speaks about impending insurance price increases due to the sunset of enhance subsidies for health insurance policies purchased at HealthCare.gov. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Sometime in the next 10 days, Wisconsin residents will see directly what the stakes are in the ongoing standoff in Washington over the federal shutdown, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Black Earth) said Wednesday.
That’s when people who buy health insurance through the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will find out their likely premiums for 2026.
“In the next probably 10 days, we’re going to have a lot more information,” Pocan said at a press conference in the state Capitol along with small business owners and state lawmakers. “Health care is going to start getting very expensive for everyone beyond what it costs now — but for some people it’s going to be so cost prohibitive that they’re going to actually wind up losing their health insurance.”
Most Democrats in the U.S. Senate have refused to vote to advance a Republican continuing resolution to keep the federal government funded and have said they won’t do so if Republicans won’t negotiate with them on the bill.
In demanding changes to the stopgap spending bill, Democrats have focused on enhanced premium tax credits that provide subsidies for most people who buy health insurance on the federal marketplace.
The enhanced subsidies, enacted in 2021 and extended in 2022, will expire at the end of this year, driving up the premium cost for health insurance policies sold on the marketplace.
Pocan said that with the premiums on ACA policies going up and losing the additional subsidies, “a couple 60 years old making $85,000 in my district could see somewhere between a $16,000 and $17,000 increase next year in their premiums.” The projections are the product of KFF, the independent health research, policy and news organization.
Macy Buhler owns a child care center. She said her own health insurance comes through her husband’s job, but some of her employees have relied on the ACA and HealthCare.gov to buy insurance. With the possibility that they won’t be able to afford those plans any more, she said, she’s been inquiring with insurance companies about their potential options.
“I’m doing the best I can,” Buhler said. “But when people don’t see that this is going to affect our workforce, it frustrates me. It will absolutely affect our workforce. It will absolutely affect families who are middle class and lower. It will affect our farmers.”
Kyle LaFond, who  owns a custom manufacturing business, said he and his team of eight employees have relied on the ACA for health insurance.
“The ACA really leveled the playing field in terms of being able to provide coverage,” LaFond said.
Among his employees, the projected increases for health insurance will range from $2,000 to about $12,000. “For a growing family, those price hikes are almost insurmountable. It’s unconscionable,” La Fond said.
With the increased subsidies expiring, “I might lose some good people,” he added. “So I’m talking about the future of my business.”
Democrats tried to make extending the subsidies part of the tax- and spending-cut megabill that President Donald Trump signed in July, but the procedure Republicans used to pass that legislation allowed them to move it through the process without Democratic votes.
Pocan said the Democrats are not willing to trust the Republican majority to  negotiate on the ACA subsidies if the Democrats first agree on the GOP bill and simply reopen the government.
Previous deals in December and in March on stopgap spending bills fell apart, he said. “Then Donald Trump did recissions, which are against the law, and started taking away funding that we did. Article 1 of the Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress and he took it away. So they get all of that.”
Pocan said the recurring Republican claim that Democrats are holding out “because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health benefits to illegal aliens — PolitiFact gave that an outright false.”
Pocan refrained from using a barnyard epithet for the claim. “Manure is what it is,” he said, glancing around at the ornately decorated Assembly parlor. “It’s a pretty room. I got to talk pretty.”
But, he said, “by federal law, not one dime can go directly to someone who’s an undocumented person — I’m going to use that terminology — from Medicare, Medicaid, or the Affordable Care Act. So, nothing. So, it’s not true.”
Public awareness about the shutdown could be lagging. Pocan said his office had 85 calls last week about the shutdown.
By contrast, in the last nine months, his office has taken 14,435 calls about health care. “So this is something that people really care about.”

[…]","Indiana Supreme Court justices, left to right: Geoffrey Slaughter, Mark Massa, Loretta Rush, Derek Molter, Christopher Goff. (Courtesy of the Indiana Supreme Court)Indiana’s Supreme Court opted not to side with Lake County taxpayers in a case that could have reformed the state’s property tax system and shrunk a major revenue stream for municipalities. 
At stake was how much land fell under a 1% tax cap for homesteads, limiting the amount of property taxes local units could collect. Currently, homeowners can only claim one acre of land under the 1% cap — Lake County taxpayers Tulsi and Kaaini Sawlani own 3.9 acres of land and sought to claim all of it under the homestead exemption. 
Property tax case argued before the Indiana Supreme Court has major implications

But Indiana’s five supreme court justices unanimously ruled against the Sawlanis, finding that they “failed to prove they use more than one acre of their property as curtilage.” Curtilage doesn’t have a definition in state statute, but is the land or buildings immediately surrounding a home. 
A lower-level court had sided with the Sawlanis, finding the one-acre limitation unconstitutional. 
“Because the Taxpayers failed to prove the Homestead Statute is unconstitutional as applied to them, we reverse the Tax Court’s decision,” said the opinion, which was authored by Justice Christopher Goff. 
A ruling in favor of the Sawlanis would have been advantageous for homeowners, but would add to the administrative burden of county assessors, who would have to review properties on a case-by-case basis. It would also mean less tax revenue for local government. 
Hoosier voters approved property tax limits in 2010 capping bills at 1% of the property’s assessed value for homesteads; 2% for other residential property and farmland; 3% for business. Increases from separately approved referendums are outside those limits.
 More about the ruling

Having just one acre of their property, rather than the full 3.9 acres, as a homestead cost the Salwanis roughly $1,000 annually, their attorney estimated. A Lake County assessor classified the remaining land as non-residential property, which puts it under the 3% cap.
But Goff wrote that the justices “hold that, even if a person’s curtilage could extend beyond one acre for tax purposes, the taxpayers here failed to show their excess property is curtilage…”
In doing so, the court opted not to wade into the greater definition of curtilage, limiting their ruling to just the case of the two Lake County taxpayers.

The ruling parses through various definitions of curtilage, including court cases from other states. A 1987 U.S. Supreme Court case held that curtilage is protected against warrantless searches, establishing a four-factor test including: the proximity of the area to the home, whether it falls within an enclosure, the nature of the uses to which the area is put and steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by passersby. 
But the ruling concludes that the Salwanis didn’t meet that criteria.
“The Taxpayers say they desire privacy, but there is no fence on the property, the trees do not form a distinguishable boundary around the lot, and the Taxpayers presented no evidence to the (Tax) Board that they use the entire plot in such a way that it should be treated as the home itself,” it said. “And the fact that the Taxpayers’ home is in a gated community with a security guard does not itself establish that the entire plot of land is curtilage.” 
In the last legislative session, lawmakers advanced a law that applied credits to homeowners but didn’t revisit property tax caps. However, some of that revenue could be replaced with income taxes — an issue some legislators said needed to be addressed in the 2026 session.

State hospital bed shortage results in county jails 'warehousing people,' at a high cost to counties and inmates who go untreated.
The post Health officials, sheriffs back bill to boost mental health resources in Wyoming jails appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming Department of Health officials and many county sheriffs hope proposed legislation will lead to more treatment for mentally ill people detained in county jails while they wait for a bed at the state’s psychiatric hospital in Evanston. 
On Monday, the Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee will consider a bill that allows the health department to reimburse sheriffs for the cost of holding those inmates. While the bill simply authorizes the department to contract with sheriffs without dictating what services are provided, its backers say it’s a necessary step to get state government resources flowing toward a problem largely being shouldered by Wyoming’s 23 counties. 
“What we’re doing right now is simply warehousing people in a jail setting and waiting,” Allen Thompson, director of the Wyoming Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police, told WyoFile. At judiciary committee meetings this summer, sheriffs have described jailhouse horror scenes of mental illness that traumatize and wear down staff and other inmates, while worsening the recovery outlook for the inmate experiencing the psychic break.
Health officials have been working with law enforcement on the measure ever since a January letter from Uinta County Sheriff Andy Kopp put the problem on lawmakers’ radar. The hope, health and law enforcement leaders told WyoFile, is that county sheriffs can both fund treatment programs inside the jails and plug holes in their budgets.
If the bill goes through, Thompson said, the state’s larger jails in particular could have better access to counselors, medications and Telehealth programs. 
Some smaller sheriff departments have expressed less interest in contracting with the health department, Thompson said, either because they don’t hold mentally ill inmates as often or because their small size makes providing treatment options more challenging. 
But boosting treatment at the state’s larger jails, like Natrona and Laramie counties, could relieve pressure on the state hospital. Sheriffs from those two counties, the state’s largest departments, have worked to craft the measure lawmakers will review Monday, Thompson said. 
Department of Health Director Stefan Johansson echoed the belief that working even with just some sheriffs could have a statewide impact. “This bill next week opens the door for us … to really grow as a system,” he told WyoFile.
For years, judges have sent more people to the Wyoming State Hospital than there have been beds available. Judges issue such orders both in criminal and civil courts — in the former after people accused of committing crimes are found mentally incompetent to stand trial, and in the latter when a judge rules someone presents a danger to themselves or others. 
The bill before the judiciary committee addresses the criminal court side of the problem. 
The hospital has 104 beds for patients, but because of staffing issues at the state-run facility, only around 80 are available today, Johansson said. Around 25 of those beds are available to patients in the criminal justice system, the director said, though they can shift some beds for that purpose depending on demand.

Judges are ordering people into that system at a higher volume than even a fully staffed facility, with 104 beds open, can handle, Johansson said. By better treating people inside jails, officials hope inmates could stabilize enough to face court and never have to go to Evanston at all. 
The backlog in Evanston has had a ripple effect on county jails around the state, where untreated mentally ill inmates wait for beds for months. Those people have often been arrested on suspicion of a crime but not convicted, and in many cases can’t see their cases adjudicated until they reach the state hospital for evaluation and treatment. 
“Some of these folks are staying in jail for a period of time longer than if they’d been allowed to just plead guilty to the crime [they’re charged with],” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Art Washut, a Casper Republican.
Meanwhile, they languish in cells, their psychic conditions often further deteriorating. Wyoming has one of the highest rates of jail suicides in the nation, according to a WyoFile investigation that examined the problem in 2023. 
Bill proponents don’t believe allowing contracts between sheriffs and the health department will solve the problem on its own, they told WyoFile. But alongside other measures aimed at addressing mentally ill individuals in the justice system, or keeping them out of it, they see a chance to start curbing the number of people waiting in jail cells for treatment.
Even if law enforcement and health officials like the measure, it could face hurdles as the conservative Wyoming Legislature approaches a state budget session with many lawmakers hoping for deep funding cuts. For the measure to make a dent on the complex problem of mental illness in jails, it requires funding, both Thompson and Johansson noted.

Sheriffs will be wary about entering into contracts with the state agency if they don’t think the state agency has enough funding, Thompson said. The health department has the ability to cover some costs with existing funds, Johansson said, but he will likely request a $4 million appropriation to cover any overruns if the department has to pay sheriffs to house and treat a large number of inmates over the coming two-year budget period. 
But the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which dominates the House and subsequently the House Appropriations Committee, is bringing particular scrutiny to the health department’s budget. At the House side’s urging, the appropriations committee recently appointed a subcommittee to take a deep dive into the agency’s budget over the course of five meetings ahead of the session, which begins in February 2026. 
So securing more funding could be a tough ask this session, Washut told WyoFile. On the other hand, under the current system, the state is leaving counties to shoulder the cost.
“It certainly is a burden on the counties to hold people in jail for such a long time,” Washut said.

Lawsuit over stormwater fees has implications for Wyoming communities' authority to fund essential infrastructure, writes Pinedale Mayor Matt Murdock. 
The post University of Wyoming’s lawsuit against Laramie puts local control across the state at risk appeared first on WyoFile .","The University of Wyoming’s lawsuit against the city of Laramie over its new stormwater fee is about far more than one city ordinance. At stake is whether Wyoming communities can fund essential infrastructure fairly, or whether local authority will be stripped away. Water, sewer, stormwater management and flood control are not abstract concepts; they keep basements dry, roads passable and streams clean. Without reliable, dedicated funding, these systems fall behind — residents pay in property damage and higher long-term costs.

Opinion

The Wyoming Constitution under Title 15 gives municipalities clear authority to establish utilities and charge fees for services. These fees are not general taxes — they are proportional, dedicated and restricted to the service provided. As water bills fund water and sewer bills fund wastewater, stormwater fees fund only drainage. In Laramie, fees are based on impervious areas — roofs, parking lots and pavement — that generate runoff. UW alone has about 10.2 million square feet, nearly a third of the city’s total, making its bill proportional to the burden its property creates. This is simply a fair way to pay for what one uses.
If such fees are struck down and reclassified as “taxes” requiring elections, the costs won’t disappear — they will shift. Instead of UW paying its share, every homeowner and small business would subsidize UW’s stormwater through property or sales taxes, while UW, as a tax-exempt state institution, may not contribute at all. That is neither fair nor sustainable. Even more troubling, UW’s lawsuit goes beyond challenging Laramie — it appears to question the Legislature’s authority in adopting the 2020 law that allowed stormwater utilities in the first place. That puts not just one city, but the work of Wyoming’s elected lawmakers, on trial.

A flooded Laramie street. 
The need is real. Laramie faces more than $130 million in stormwater improvements, with $30 million urgently needed. Those costs can’t be absorbed into general revenues without shortchanging other services. A dedicated fee ensures that those who create more runoff cover the burden they impose.
This lawsuit also could have been avoided. The city invited UW into discussions, offered credits for on-campus systems and proposed a regional detention pond. UW’s bill could have been reduced by nearly half if those talks had continued. Instead, the university went to court. As the proverb warns, “Do not be quick to go to court.” Dialogue and compromise should be the first choice — and thankfully, they remain possible.
Having two leading institutions fight in court is a no-win situation for all of us. The Wyoming Association of Municipalities urges the UW Board of Trustees to meet with Laramie leaders before pressing further. Concrete solutions exist that would save UW money and strengthen the city’s infrastructure.
This case is not just about Laramie. It is about whether municipalities can govern effectively. Local officials are accountable to their citizens, operate in the open, and budget transparently. Dedicated fees ensure that each user pays proportionately and revenues are used only for their purpose.
Undermining this authority risks compromising infrastructure and self-government. For Wyoming communities, the principle is simple: Local control matters. Title 15 affirms it, our history demands it and our future depends on it.

Having moved around a lot, columnist David Romtvedt asked a life-long Wyomingite, ""What it’s like knowing a place and the people who live there so well?""
The post Our greatest treasures appeared first on WyoFile .","My father left school after the sixth grade and spent most of his life looking for work. This meant that we moved a lot — the coast, the valley, the desert — living in the country sometimes, sometimes in small towns and sometimes in cities. In my first six years of public school, I attended six different schools. I have no friends from childhood. Moving so often also meant that I rarely saw any of my aunts and uncles or their children — my cousins. I can’t even name all my cousins. My sense of not belonging anywhere was intensified by my father’s extreme mood swings and physical violence. No one wanted to visit our house. I left home the day after I graduated from high school.

Opinion

At 34, I came to Wyoming, and while I’ve now lived here a long time, my life is shaped at least as much by the years spent outside Wyoming as inside it. What, I wonder, might it feel like to live in a single place? With that in mind, I spoke with a 94-year-old woman who was born in and has spent her life in Buffalo. Her parents, too, were born and lived their lives in Buffalo. And her grandparents, who emigrated from Europe, never left Buffalo once they arrived.
What it’s like, I asked, knowing a place and the people who live there so well? What has changed and what remains the same? Is this the Wyoming you knew twenty years ago? Forty years ago? Sixty? Eighty?
Here’s what she told me: “I like living in a state with a low population where you know your community and you have the pleasure of fresh air and of animals — in Wyoming, you can get excited about seeing a horned toad. The landscape is a comfort. You’re insulated by it. I was lucky to be raised on a ranch and to marry a rancher.
“I don’t think I’ve ever thought about what’s gone. I miss riding horseback, but that’s just my own condition. I’m glad to have indoor toilets. I like the new phones, the new cars, things that make material life easier. Sometimes, though, things we call progress aren’t so good in the long run. I worry, for example, about the amount of water we’re using for minerals extraction.
“My grandmother would never have told anyone who she voted for. Now, everyone has a placard up in the air and you know right where they are, but back then it was a private thing — at least in my family. My aunt did tell me my grandmother always voted Democratic because Roosevelt gave her a job sewing during the Depression, and she got a wage.
“We no longer have counter checks. You could go in a store and there’d be blank checks from all the banks. You just picked one from whatever bank you went to. They still had these when my daughter was a young woman and she once picked up the wrong check. The bank called her and said, ‘You don’t have an account here.’ It was so trustful then. Stores would sometimes bill ranchers once a year. I remember hearing a store owner say to someone on the phone, ‘Yes, yes, he’s a really good customer. You can depend on him paying before the year’s over.’
“We took it for granted to be homemakers, then there was a time when that was looked at with a little disdain — baking cookies. A woman now about has to be part breadwinner if a family wants a middle-class life. There’s more pressure on women but more freedom, too. And most fathers welcome their daughters going to college, getting their degree, finding their talent.
Sometimes I see children and adults on the street or in a restaurant — you look around and they’re all on their phones. You don’t know if you should start a conversation, if they’re doing something serious or just scanning. People engage less. If you’re shy, though, it’s great because it gives you something to do.
“I hope the public land stays in place. I hope agriculture and ranching go on — family ranches. I hope that just because we’re a state with a lot of land and not many people, we don’t end up bombarded with things that will degrade our place. At our family ranch, there are huge tanks now as you come in. They’re digging a water line. It’s just a water line, but they’re tearing up so much land. I feel humiliated and kind of ashamed when I see how much damage is being done. I hope we recognize that Wyoming’s open spaces and wildlife are among our greatest treasures.”

Last month, The Nature Conservancy reached a milestone after helping secure a conservation easement on a 5,368 acre ranch near the Pioneer Mountains owned by Glenn Schumacher. The easement put the organization and its partners over the milestone of protecting a cumulative 100,000 acres in central Idaho since 2007.
“One of the biggest challenges for wildlife and conservation is habitat fragmentation, so we’re trying to find areas where there’s intact landscapes and seeing how we can hold those together,” said Tess O’Sullivan, land and water protection program manager for The Nature Conservancy. 
The effort is part of a large partnership between ranchers, local residents, conservationists, nongovernment organizations and land managers called the Pioneers Alliance. Members of the alliance include The Nature Conservancy, The Wood River Land Trust, The Conservation Fund, Idaho Wildlife Foundation, Idaho Conservation League, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, various state and federal agencies, cities and community members. 
 What is a conservation easement?

A conservation easement is a voluntary, permanent legal agreement between a landowner, rancher or farmer and a land trust or government agency. The landowner continues to own their land and maintain their use of farming or ranching, but they agree to protect wildlife habitat, often by agreeing not to subdivide and develop their land, O’Sullivan said. 
If the landowner sells the land or dies, the conservation easement stays with the property permanently. 
Schumacher, who owns a ranch near the Pioneer Mountains, said O’Sullivan worked with him for about a year and a half to explain the process and secure the conservation easement. 
“The main goal was preserving the open spaces – and for wildlife – just preserving this into perpetuity for the migration of wildlife and cattle ranching,” Schumacher said in a phone interview. 
O’Sullivan said conservation easements are a tool that allow ranchers and farmers to continue their agricultural use of the property while protecting it from development that would encroach on wildlife habitat and migration corridors.

Partners in the Pioneers Alliance are seeking to project land within the central Idaho corridor between the Pioneer Mountains and Craters of the Moon National Monument. 
“Some of the primary things we’ve been looking at are areas that are identified as important for wildlife connections – migration corridors and pathways for wildlife to move across landscapes,” O’Sullivan said. 
Because the landscape is a mixture of federal and state land and large ranches that has not been broken up and developed, the land supports wildlife movement and migration, said Keri York, land protection manager for the Wood River Land Trust.  
One of the largest overland pronghorn migration routes has been documented in the corridor between the Pioneer Mountains and Craters of the Moon National Monument. The area also provides a habitat for deer, antelope, sage grouse, elk and endangered wolverines. 
O’Sullivan and York said there is a connection between protecting private land and public land.
“Because of historic and cultural aspects of the region, its open vast landscape and the wildlife habitat it provides, our organizations came together to protect the private land within that landscape so it could be added to the public and state land that is already ‘protected,'” York said. 
For Schumacher, the rancher, he liked that his conservation easement protected ranching and wildlife habitat. 
“It’s a combination, a balancing act between agriculture and wildlife that I like,” Schumacher said. “That is my personal preference. I want to see the balancing act.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)A demand that Vanderbilt University sign onto a “compact” — pledging to comply with new Trump administration higher education directives in exchange for preferential access to federal funding — is drawing pushback from some campus groups.
More than 900 Vanderbilt students, faculty and staff as of Wednesday signed onto a petition titled “Vanderbilt-Don’t Sign Trump’s Fascist Compact” circulated by the Vanderbilt Graduate Workers United union.
A statement by the Vanderbilt University chapter of American Association of University Professors likewise urged Vanderbilt University leaders to reject the proposal. 
“It is difficult to interpret the Compact as anything other than a direct and concerted assault on academic freedom, and thus on the core identity of our institution and on the role of higher education in American society,” the statement said. 
Vanderbilt is one of nine elite universities the Trump administration last week asked to sign onto a “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education.” 
The 10-page compact, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, sets forth a sweeping set of guidelines for admissions, campus speech and protest, athletics, faculty hiring, international students and other parts of campus life. 
Among the requirements set forth in the compact: 

All campus faculty and employees will “abstain from actions or speech relating to societal and political events except in cases in which external events have a direct impact upon the university;”
Foreign students are limited to no more than 15% of the student body;
Administrators agree to bar speech or actions that would “punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas;”
And campuses would commit to combat harassment of students or protests that block campus facilities by “using lawful force if necessary to prevent these violations and to swift, serious, and consistent sanctions for those who commit them.”

“Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,” the compact says
A statement from Vanderbilt said, “we look forward to carefully reviewing the compact and providing meaningful feedback to the administration.” 
In addition to Vanderbilt, letters were sent to Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Virginia.

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)The state is working to recover up to $32.4 million after it came to light that it may have mistakenly paid Medicaid participant fees for thousands of ineligible individuals who were incarcerated or dead, a new audit revealed. 
West Virginia uses managed care organizations to manage Medicaid services for most of the state’s Medicaid users and pays per enrollee. Most inmates are not eligible to receive Medicaid under federal guidelines, yet from 2019 to 2022, the state’s Bureau of Medical Services potentially overpaid those MCOs for 117,447 cases of incarcerated individuals — approximately $31.7 million in capitation payments.
The state also may have overpaid the organizations for 15,346 cases involving deceased people, approximately $770,000 in capitation payments.
The audit of the bureau was performed by the Legislature’s Post Audit Division and noted errors and inconsistencies in BMS data were a challenge in the project. 
“During the audit, significant delays in completing our objectives were incurred due to various issues with obtaining reliable data from BMS,” said Mike Jones, audit manager for the state’s Post Audit Division. He presented the report to lawmakers Tuesday at the state Capitol.
BMS is currently working to correct the overpayment issue. 
“BMS has already made notable progress in correcting errors,” Jones said. “As a result, the $32.4 million identified is likely decreasing due to the continued efforts of BMS.”
Cindy Beane, commissioner for BMS, said that they’d already begun correcting the issue prior to the audit. Approximately $2.37 million has been recouped at this point. 
“We paid the MCO when we shouldn’t have paid the MCO,” Beane said. “At the same time they started the audit, we were already in the process of getting money back from the MCOs and fixing it.”
BMS contracts with Mountain Health Trust and its MCOs to manage  services for 87% of the state’s Medicaid users. The services are delivered through three MCOs — Aetna, The Health Plan and Unicare — and they receive monthly capitation payments based on a per-member-per-month basis. Medicaid eligibility is based on data provided by the state. 
Jones explained that audits in other states revealed payments were made for incarcerated or deceased individuals to the same MCOs used by West Virginia, prompting the state’s own audit to see if the issue was happening here. 
Beane said that there had been issues in getting accurate data about who was eligible for Medicaid, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the state’s data accuracy at the time over the possible overpayments. 
She told lawmakers that it will be a slow process — likely months — to recoup the remaining roughly $30 million as they verify data and vital statistics of Medicaid users. She said they’re also evaluating how much they are actually owed from the MCOs.
Del. Tristan Leavitt, R-Kanahwa
Real-time data about who is incarcerated is still a problem, prompting Del. Tristan Leavitt, R-Kanawha, to question if there could be more money that hasn’t been recovered.
“Since this incarceration issue wasn’t spotted until the audit … Can you get back to us on why we also wouldn’t believe, say from 2105 to 2018 there may not be another $30 million there that hasn’t been recovered?” he asked. 
Beane maintained that they now have better communication with the state’s corrections division and their own internal controls to prevent future overpayment. 
“I don’t think there are additional large sums of payments overpaid,” Beane said. “I think we’ve put safeguards in place moving forward.”
The audit recommended that BMS report in writing to the legislative auditor and lawmakers on the Post Audits Subcommittee once the overpayments have been corrected.

Kennedy.  (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)WASHINGTON — A majority of Americans disapprove of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s job performance and the federal government’s evolving vaccine policy, according to a poll released Thursday by the nonpartisan health organization KFF.
In addition, the vast majority of those surveyed have heard the unproven claims made by President Donald Trump, Kennedy and others in late September that taking acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, during pregnancy could be one possible environmental factor in a child later being diagnosed with autism.
A total of 77% of the people KFF polled said they knew of the statements, though whether people believe the claims, which have yet to be established by the medical community, varied.
Only 4% of those surveyed said it is “definitely true” that taking Tylenol during pregnancy increases the risk of the child developing autism, and 35% said the claim is “definitely false.”
Thirty percent said it is “probably true” and 30% said it is “probably false.”Combined, 65% said it’s either probably or definitely false to say that taking acetaminophen during pregnancy increases the chance of a child developing autism, a complex disorder that experts believe is the result of both genetic and environmental factors.
When broken down by political party, 86% of Democrats, 67% of independents and 43% of Republicans said the claims were either probably or definitely false.
The survey shows 59% somewhat or strongly disapprove of how Kennedy is handling his new role at the top of the country’s public health infrastructure.
The level of support changes considerably depending on political party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats, 64% of independents and 26% of Republicans disapproving.
A slightly higher number, 62%, either somewhat or strongly disapprove of the United States’ vaccine policy.
A similar trend emerged when those polled were broken up by political parties. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats, 67% of independents and 31% of Republicans somewhat or strongly disapproved of vaccine policy.
The survey shows a declining share of Americans have faith in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide trusted information about vaccines, compared with previous KFF polls in September 2023 and earlier this year.
A total of 63% of respondents two years ago trusted the CDC on vaccines, but that has declined to 50%.
Democrats’ faith in the CDC’s vaccine recommendations has dropped from 88% two years ago to 64%, independents have gone from 61% to 47% and Republicans have remained relatively steady, only going from 40% to 39%.
Across political parties, a person’s own doctor as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association remain broadly trusted for vaccine information.
Eighty-three percent said they trust their doctor or health care provider, 69% believed information from the American Academy of Pediatrics and 64% had faith in the AMA.
The poll of 1,334 adults took place from Sept. 23 to Sept. 29 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for the full survey. Questions broken down by a person’s political ideology had a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points.

In a press call Wednesday, the lawmakers said the government is shut down solely because Republicans, who control the White House, U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, refuse to negotiate a compromise with Democrats. 
Members in the Senate failed to reach an agreement on a short-term government funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, before the end of the fiscal year, meaning many major federal government operations shut down starting Oct. 1. The last government shutdown occurred during President Donald Trump’s first term and lasted 35 days, from late 2018 into early 2019. The current shutdown could last longer and have a wider effect.

Democrats won’t support Republicans’ funding proposals until they restore “at least some portion of the health care they took away” in the July megabill Trump signed into law, Hickenlooper said. 
“We’re asking this administration to take basic action to restore Americans’ health care,” Hickenlooper said. “So far, Republicans don’t appear even to listen … they’re not even doing the bare minimum.”
Trump regularly said he would lower costs for working people, Hickenlooper said, but that hasn’t happened, and he instead continues to “mislead Americans.” 
Addressing health care costs is urgent because premium notices for next year will start going out soon, U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette of Denver said. For a family of four in Colorado with an annual income of $64,000, DeGette said premium costs will increase more than $2,500. U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood said open enrollment for those seeking Affordable Care Act plans also starts soon, and those plans will cost two to three times what they have over the last year.
Cost increases will be worse for those on the Western Slope, DeGette added. U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse of Lafayette, whose district includes Western Slope communities in Eagle, Grand and Summit counties, said his constituents could pay some of the highest health insurance rates in the country if tax credits are not renewed. 










We’re asking this administration to take basic action to restore Americans’ health care ... So far, Republicans don't appear even to listen … they’re not even doing the bare minimum.


– U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper


The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. According to KFF, insurance providers have cited the expiration of the tax credits as a reason for premium increases. 
Some House Republicans proposed a one-year extension of the enhanced tax credits, but DeGette said House Speaker Mike Johnson “immediately shot it down from his own members.” 
It’s “deeply disappointing” that Republicans “target the immigrant community” and spread misinformation saying Democrats want to fund health care for people who are in the country without authorization, Pettersen said. Tax credits only go to lawful citizens and residents who pay taxes, she said.
“The Republicans know this, and their rhetoric is incredibly disturbing that they continue to spread lies and misinformation around this,” Pettersen said. 
During previous shutdowns, federal agencies had designated people available to help constituents, but that isn’t happening at all during this shutdown, DeGette said. For example, she said Social Security isn’t responding to any calls from her office. Pettersen said her office was told the agencies won’t respond to any constituent request “unless it’s life or death.” 
Shutdown puts stress on federal workers
Neguse said he spent Wednesday morning meeting with federal workers in his district who are “being unfairly impacted by the shutdown that House Republicans, Senate Republicans and the Trump administration have engineered.”
He said Republicans, with their trifecta control of the federal government, “have an obligation to fund the government” and negotiate with Democrats.
“I know that me and my colleagues gathered today would certainly relish that opportunity,” Neguse said. “To negotiate in good faith on a bipartisan agreement that funds the government, opens the government, and addresses the health care crisis that they have created.”
Pettersen said the government was set up to work in a bipartisan manner and that Republicans were unwilling to work with Democrats to avoid a shutdown. Her district includes the Denver Federal Center, where she said about 6,000 federal employees work daily, and morale is low “with the way that they have been demonized since Trump took office.” 
Staffing shortages at the Denver International Airport are further exacerbated during the shutdown, DeGette said, with many Transportation Security Administration employees working mandatory overtime. 
U.S. Rep. Jason Crow of Centennial said every year he has been in Congress it has passed a bipartisan budget. 
“We haven’t always got everything we wanted, both sides, so it was a compromise,” Crow said. “But we’ve never faced anything like this before where they are trying to cut, slash health care entirely for millions of Americans and then radically increase the premiums for tens of millions more.” 
Crow said the Trump administration wants Congress to approve “a blank check” so the federal government can send military troops “and declare war on cities” in America and “continue abuse by federal officers on our immigrant and refugee communities.” He said Republicans want to “destroy agencies and fundamental government services.”
In a speech to military leaders, Trump suggested that American cities should be used as “training grounds” for the armed forces. Trump has already deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Portland, Oregon, and other American cities to support immigration enforcement and “law and order.”

In the hours after 17-year-old David was locked in housing unit H, voices filtered into his cell.
The sound came from multiple places at once: the seams of the door, the vent by the ceiling, the walls themselves. They knew he’d just arrived, and now they wanted to know who he was. Why was he there?
The children in the surrounding cells were trying to speak to him, he realized. Just as they were curious about him, he had a question for them. Where was he?
“You’re not going to be coming out any time soon,” he remembers them saying. “You should just try to lay down.” He was in a place they called  “the hole” — a solitary confinement unit.
David was incarcerated in Shelby County’s juvenile detention center, the Youth Justice and Education Center, in 2024. He was kept there for eight months. The name David is a pseudonym of his choosing; he has been granted anonymity to protect him from potential retaliation.
Juvenile detention centers, similar to jails in the adult system, house youth who have been charged with a crime but who have not yet been found innocent or guilty. They are not being punished; instead, they are waiting for their court cases to be resolved. In other words, when David was incarcerated, he did not know when he’d be released.
He thought he’d been put in H-pod because he’d been fighting. But spending so much time alone started to make him feel violent. “You’d think they actually want you to fight,” he said. “I couldn’t do anything but do pushups and get mad and think about stuff. It makes you want to come out and put your hands on somebody.”
As of Wednesday Oct. 1, the Shelby County Division of Corrections operates the Youth Justice and Education Center. The Shelby County Sheriff ran the center from 2015 through September 2025.
At one point, David asked a sheriff’s deputy why he couldn’t at least go to school. “If you were on a regular pod, you could go to school,” David remembered the deputy saying. But he wasn’t on a regular pod anymore. “Welcome to solitary confinement,” the deputy told him. 
Children incarcerated in Shelby County’s juvenile detention center are frequently held in solitary confinement, according to more than two dozen sources who spoke with MLK50: Justice Through Journalism.
Tennessee law prohibits holding children in seclusion, a term often used interchangeably with solitary confinement, for longer than two continuous hours. But according to source accounts, the center has two solitary confinement units — D-pod and H-pod — where children as young as 13 are confined to their cells for 23 hours or more at a time, for periods of weeks or months. According to records reviewed by MLK50, one of these confinement units, D-pod, has existed since late 2023.
D-pod and H-pod are “behavior — not confinement — units,” a spokesperson for the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office told MLK50 in a written statement. “They have the same activities as other housing units except they are not allowed to be with the others due to their disruptive behavior.” They also said youth had not been placed in D-pod or H-pod as punishment.
The sheriff’s office denied that youth in the center have been kept in solitary confinement. Still, a spokesperson for the sheriff declined to share how they define the term.
As of 2021, Tennessee law defines seclusion as the “involuntary segregation of a child from the rest of the resident population,” even when children can see or hear other youth in their housing unit. But the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services, which licenses the Youth Justice and Education Center, has a different definition of seclusionin its rules for Juvenile Detention Centers. DCS’s rules, which were last updated in 2017, state that seclusion does not include “confinement to a locked unit or ward where other youth are present.”
In this article, MLK50 is using the United Nations’ definition of solitary confinement — “the confinement of prisoners for 22 hours or more a day without meaningful human contact.” The United Nations also describes “prolonged solitary confinement” — periods of solitary confinement that last longer than 15 days — as a form of torture.
Records show that Memphis-Shelby County’s Juvenile Court has been aware that youth in D-pod are separated from the general population and confined to their cells for most of the day since at least 2024. During the same time period, juvenile court magistrates incarcerated more youth at the center than the previous court administration, even as the number of youth charged with serious offenses declined. Despite multiple requests for comment, a court representative did not provide a statement for this article.
Meanwhile, inspection records show Tennessee’s Department of Children’s Services has been aware that youth in D-pod are separated from the general population since at least 2024. DCS was also aware that youth in D-pod are not allowed to attend school. A DCS spokesperson said they were not aware of any use of solitary confinement inside the center.
One parent told MLK50 that his son became suicidal after several weeks in D-pod. In 2024, the Shelby County sheriff recorded 50 suicide crisis calls — a 16% increase over the previous year — and 14 suicide attempts among children incarcerated at the detention center, after reporting none the year before.
 “It’s a pressure zone”

There were no clocks in H-pod, David realized.
He kept track of time through his meals. When it was time to eat, deputies opened the door to his cell, handed him a tray and then closed the door again. If he was being served breakfast it must be 7 a.m., he thought, reasoning from his experience in E-pod. If they gave him lunch, it must be noon.
If nothing else, there was a clear distinction between day and night. Each cell had a fluorescent overhead lamp that emitted a piercing white light during waking hours. The lights never went out, he said. Instead, guards marked each evening by flipping a switch that turned the pod a muted orange.
Most youth didn’t sleep at night, David said. Instead they’d scream and yell, using the vents, the cracks and the strength of their voices to communicate with each other. “They’d be up all night, arguing,” he said. “You wouldn’t be able to sleep until 3 or 4 a.m.” The next day, they’d nap well into the afternoon.
They stayed up at night because they had little to do during the day, he added.
They were confined to cells a little larger than a king-sized mattress, with a concrete shelf that served as a bed, a thin mat laid over that concrete, an itchy blanket and no pillow. In the corner, there was a metal toilet and sink. There were two narrow windows on either side of each cell; one embedded in the cell door, and one that offered a view outside. Beyond this, there was nothing.
Looking back, it is difficult for David to recall exactly how he spent most of his time in that cell. How does one describe a period characterized by absence?
It is simpler to catalog what he lacked. In E-pod, there were books to read inside his cell; in H-pod, there were none. There were no games to play, no time outside. He would sometimes speak to another child through the walls — usually, they’d talk about what they’d do when they were free — but their conversations always petered off. “There’s only so much you can talk about,” he said.
He took to staring out of his window. He could see a sliver of the gravel road outside the detention center, and monitored it for hours at a time. He’d track the movements of other people: the sheriff’s deputies who came in and out each day, youth who had been arrested, youth who had been discharged. When he recognized one of the kids leaving, he’d tap on the glass of the window, wave and try not to wonder when he’d take their place.
At points, he became restless. He’d run in place for as long as he could, do pushups and a few jumping jacks each day. Sometimes he’d jump off his bed, land on the floor and jump back again.
“If you don’t move around, it’ll take a toll on you,” he said.
The other kids were restless, too. They were angry that the guards wouldn’t let them out, and found ways to retaliate. “They’d poop on their clothes,” he said. “They’d bust the sprinklers, or bust the toilet.” The entire pod constantly smelled of sewage.
Solitary confinement seemed to dissolve one’s inhibitions, David noticed. “It’s a pressure zone,” he said. “Those who can pop, do it.”
When he was briefly let out of his cell — usually, every other day but sometimes every three days — he could make a phone call, which he thought was supposed to last a half hour. He suspected these calls were sometimes cut short by guards; they’d tell him 30 minutes had elapsed, even as he felt it might have been five or 10 minutes less than that. After being incarcerated for several months, “you know what a 30-minute phone call is,” he said. Still, he had no way to prove they had lied.
It was all messing with his head. His thoughts raced, and he felt surges of anger he couldn’t explain.
“I didn’t think I was ever coming home,” he said. He often wished he could just see his mother. Before his incarceration, “I was used to seeing my mama every day,” he said. In H-pod, he saw her in person for a half hour once each week, if that.
Eventually, he stopped himself from thinking about home at all; those kinds of thoughts would “mess you up,” he said. Instead, he thought about what the next few years might be like if he stayed in jail. He decided he didn’t care. As long as he wasn’t in H-pod anymore, he could tolerate it.
 Solitary confinement’s impact on adolescents

Solitary confinement units are not uncommon in American prisons and jails, said Dr. Terry Kupers, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at the Wright Institute who has served as an expert witness in dozens of lawsuits about conditions in correctional facilities. Kupers is also the co-author of “Ending Isolation,” which argues that the practice of solitary confinement should be abolished.
It wasn’t always this way. When Kupers began practicing five decades ago, solitary confinement was rarely used, he said.
“Back in the ’70s, the problem was overcrowding,” he said. “There were all these laws that made sentences for just about every crime worse. And so the jails and prisons got very crowded. When you crowd jails and prisons, the social science research shows you have an increase in the rate of violence, the rate of mental breakdown, the rate of suicide, et cetera.”
Prison officials began to use solitary confinement to reduce that disorder, Kupers said. “In the 1980s, the prisons were totally out of control,” he said. “All over the country, there were what they called riots. Often it was prisoner hunger strikes and resistance wanting better conditions, but they called it riots. So the state said, ‘We know what we’re going to do about this. We’re going to lock down the prisoners.’ They started building these solitary confinement units, entire cell blocks or prisons dedicated to solitary confinement.”
That trend spread to juvenile facilities, said Mark Soler, the former executive director of the Center for Children’s Law & Policy.
“What happens is the staff put the young people who they consider to be the troublemakers in the lockdown unit,” Soler said. “They don’t have anything to do. That’s a critical characteristic of this situation: The kids don’t have anything to do.”

By his own estimation, Kupers has now interviewed over a thousand people who have spent time in solitary confinement. In the process, he developed a framework for what solitary does to the human mind.
The primary characteristic of solitary confinement is a forced lack of social interaction, Kupers said. It is accompanied by few amenities or constructive programming. “It’s isolation and idleness,” he said.
Our most basic needs are often understood physically: food, water and shelter. But social interactions are “central and critical to being human,” Kupers said. When one is deprived of those interactions, the brain begins to malfunction.
People kept in solitary confinement for long periods of time “have severe anxiety, including panic attacks,” he said. Often, they find it difficult to sleep. “There’s noise in solitary confinement, which keeps you from sleeping. But the anxiety also keeps you from sleeping.”
Eventually, “Their thinking becomes disordered,” he added. “They become paranoid, they become very depressed. Despair is widespread.”
Sometimes, people locked in isolation units may be able to speak with each other. That doesn’t mean it’s not still solitary confinement, said Kupers.
“People talk through the heating vents or scream out in the open air space and someone answers them,” he said. “That’s not meaningful human communication.”
Adolescents have a particularly acute need for other people, Kupers said. “There’s a very narrow window in adolescence when people are accruing social skills, emotional skills, educational capacities,” he said. “If they don’t get it, often they can’t go back and get it later.”
In solitary confinement, one might find that mental tasks that used to come easily are now impossible.
“People have problems with concentration and memory,” Kupers said. “I say to people in solitary, ‘You know, if I was in solitary, I would read everything I could get my hands on.’ And they tell me, ‘Well, I try to do that, but in fact, I can’t remember when I read the page before, so I gave up reading.’”
People held in isolation often start to behave strangely. “They do compulsive things,” he said. “They pace, they count the cinder blocks making up their cells.” Some have psychotic breaks.
“Another symptom is mounting anger,” he added. “Then they’re terrified that [that anger] will get them in trouble with the staff and they’ll have a longer time in solitary. This happens a lot with kids who tell me, ‘I’m never going to get out of here.’”
Solitary confinement is typically intended to control bad behavior, said Kupers. But it’s more likely to make behavioral problems worse.
There are other ways of managing misbehavior, Soler said. “The staff should talk to the youth and ask, ‘What’s wrong, what’s the problem?’” he said. “Kids do things for all kinds of reasons, but they generally have a reason. Staff should be talking to the child to find out what the problem is.”
“Putting kids in solitary is not going to have a deterrent effect. Kids don’t think into the future in terms of the consequences of their behavior,” he added. “You lock kids up in their room, and all they do is think about how angry they are.”
The most severe consequence of solitary confinement is suicide, said Soler.
“I have represented families of children who have killed themselves in jail cells,” he said. “The truth is, if you’ve got a child who’s really in crisis, a child who can’t control themselves, something really bad is going on around the child. The last thing you want to do is leave the child alone, because they’re just going to get more and more depressed, and that’s when they start thinking, ‘I have no future. I have to end my life.’”
Most youth who commit suicide in juvenile facilities are either in solitary confinement or have been held in solitary confinement in the past, according to a 2009 U.S. Department of Justice report.
One father told MLK50 that his son, who had been held in D-pod for weeks, became suicidal last winter while in solitary confinement.
When asked if youth in solitary confinement units ever became suicidal, a sheriff’s office spokesperson reiterated that youth in D- and H-pods were not being held in solitary confinement.
At a different point in their statement, the spokesperson wrote that “Mental health staff work closely with these youth as the goal is to return them to the other housing units.”
 Memphis-Shelby County Juvenile Court knew about solitary confinement 

Ala’a Alattiyat first heard about the Youth Justice and Education Center’s solitary confinement units about a year ago.
Alattiyat is the coordinator for the Youth Justice Action Council, “a coalition of justice-impacted and connected youth and adults who want to change the way the so-called ‘youth justice’ system works in Memphis,” she said.

Last summer, Alattiyat was tasked with finding youth who might participate in the council; ideally, youth who had experienced Shelby County’s juvenile justice system firsthand. She began to show up at community centers and schools around the city.
She started encountering youth who had been incarcerated in the Youth Justice and Education Center almost immediately. When she asked them what it was like there, they described solitary confinement.
“I recall one young person describing it like how an adult would,” she said. “He said, ‘They put us in the hole.’ I think he said he was in the hole for multiple weeks.”
Eventually, Alattiyat recruited a group of youth for the council. In early 2025, one of those youths was arrested and incarcerated at the juvenile detention center, where he remained for seven months.
At first, Alattiyat heard from him frequently. But as time went on, his communications became sporadic. He’d started fighting, she said, and was moved to H-pod as punishment.
“I was like, ‘So what does that mean?’” Alattiyat remembers. She asked the other youth in the Youth Justice Action Council if they’d heard of H-pod. “That means he’s in solitary,” they told her.
Under a 2021 state law, seclusion is defined as “the involuntary segregation of a child from the rest of the resident population, regardless of the reason for the segregation, including confinement to a locked unit or ward where other children may be seen or heard but are separated from those children,” said Zoe Jamail, a former policy director at Disability Rights Tennessee who co-authored a report alleging abuses at the Wilder Youth Development Center in Somerville, Tennessee.
The law permits seclusion for up to two hours continuously, and no more than six hours in an entire day. It forbids seclusion for any length of time for punishment, administrative convenience or as a response to staffing levels.
Despite this, the Youth Justice and Education Center appears to have two solitary confinement units where youth are held in seclusion for much longer than two hours at a time.
The center opened in July 2023 as a replacement for Shelby County’s previous juvenile detention center. According to Department of Children’s Services inspection records and blueprints reviewed by MLK50, the center has eight residential housing units. Six of these housing units have 12 cells; the remaining two, D-pod and H-pod, have 25 each. According to DCS inspection reports obtained via records request, when the facility opened, these two larger housing units were intended to house youth who had been “bound over,” or transferred to the adult system.
But halfway through 2023, magistrates in Memphis-Shelby County’s Juvenile Court began to incarcerate more youth. Correspondingly, the detention center’s population rose rapidly. In response to this increase in population, the center moved youth who had been transferred to the adult system to an adult facility, Sheriff’s Office Chief Inspector Kimberly Lee told a DCS inspector, who documented their conversation in an inspection report obtained via records request. According to sheriff’s office jail report cards, these youth are now incarcerated in Jail East.
In the absence of those youths, sources say, D-pod and H-pod have been repurposed into solitary confinement units. A spokesperson for the sheriff’s office wrote that these pods are “behavior — not confinement — units.”
“D-pod was designated as such in late 2023 or early 2024,” the spokesperson wrote. “H-pod was designated as such in 2025. These are needed to house disruptive youth who fight with others for the safety of the other youth, staff, teachers, etc.”
Youth are not sent to D or H-pod as punishment, the spokesperson added. Still, “their behavior dictates their placement,” he wrote.

Youth are not sent to D or H-pod as punishment, the spokesperson added. Still, “their behavior dictates their placement,” he wrote.
When asked if youth could be held in D-pod or H-pod for periods of weeks or months, the spokesperson told MLK50 that “This would be determined by their behavior.”
In March 2024, Lee informed a DCS inspector that children in D-pod had been separated from the general population, according to a DCS inspection report. This unit was now “a pod for youth that had behavioral issues” including “fighting in school or mental health concerns.” They did not yet have “educational services” inside D-pod, though she said they planned to provide them in the future.
In his report, the inspector noted that he did not speak with children inside D-pod. In later inspection reports, DCS inspectors did not record any follow-up attempts to talk to those youth.
When asked about allegations that youth were held in solitary confinement in D-pod, a Department of Children’s Services spokesperson told MLK50 that inspectors were not aware of any instances of solitary confinement inside the center.
The state’s Board of Education requires four hours of education per day inside juvenile facilities. When asked why DCS had not pursued corrective action once an inspector learned that children in D-pod were not attending school, a spokesperson said that Memphis-Shelby County Schools — not the Department of Children’s Services — is responsible for ensuring that youth inside the center access education.
When asked whether youth in D-pod and H-pod have been barred from attending school, the sheriff’s office spokesperson wrote, “They may be removed from school attendance due to conduct but once they are able to control themselves, they are returned to school.” At the same time, the spokesperson acknowledged that when youth are placed in D-pod or H-pod, they are kept separate from the rest of the detention center’s population.
Leadership in Memphis-Shelby County’s Juvenile Court also seemed to be aware of one of the solitary confinement units. In November 2023, a consultant hired by juvenile court visited the center. His official report, which was issued in July 2024 and obtained via records request, noted that “unit D is being operated as a behavioral confinement unit” and within unit D, “most, if not all youth” had not been let out of their rooms that day.

During a March 2025 meeting to discuss the juvenile detention center transition, the court’s chief judicial officer, Erica Evans, acknowledged that children in the center were being held in solitary confinement, according to a recording one of the meeting’s participants gave MLK50.
“When we’re talking about visitation and 23 and 1, Tennessee rules explicitly discuss that and what the minimum requirements are, and we know they’re not being met right now,” she said. Evans did not respond to a request for comment.
The same source who provided MLK50 with this recording said that “23 and 1” is a common term used to describe solitary confinement inside the center, in which one is confined to a cell for 23 hours a day.
Despite reports of solitary confinement inside the center, juvenile court magistrates continued to incarcerate more youth in the center than the previous court administration.
Children in the Youth Justice and Education Center have not been found guilty of any offense, nor are they being punished. Juvenile court magistrates incarcerate children who have been deemed a flight risk or a threat to the community.
In Shelby County, juvenile court cases can last months. Some youth are incarcerated until their cases are resolved, though magistrates can choose to release them at any time. According to the court’s own data, it is now increasingly common for the court to keep youth in the detention center for 90 days or more.
MLK50 sent juvenile court multiple requests for comment. A juvenile court spokesperson did not provide a statement for this article.
David was incarcerated for eight months, the entirety of his case. He had been charged with two class-B felonies, including aggravated robbery, and court records show prosecutors briefly attempted to try him as an adult.
David says he didn’t commit the robbery, though records show he was adjudicated delinquent, the rough equivalent of being “found guilty” in the juvenile justice system.
Still, David was never tried as an adult, nor was he incarcerated after his case ended. Instead, court records show he was electronically monitored for three months following his release — less than half the time he spent in the detention center.
David spent the last months of his incarceration in housing unit H. The day he finally left the pod was also the day he went home, in early 2025.
It feels good to be free, he said.  “Now I can do what I want to.”
Still, incarceration has left its mark. To this day, he can’t deviate from the mealtimes set by detention center staff. Every time he drinks a glass of water, he remembers the feeling of his throat drying out as he waited hours for guards to bring him a cup. Each time he sees a school resource officer at his high school, he has to remind himself not to be afraid. And when he goes to sleep, his dreams tend to take him back to his cell in H-pod.
“It’s like you’re free, but your mind is still locked up,” he said.

Most national park employees across the country were furloughed due to a lapse in federal appropriations caused by the shutdown.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)The New Orleans Jazz Historical National Park and other national park sites in southern Louisiana are closed until further notice due to the federal government shutdown that began last week.
Most national park employees across the country were furloughed due to a lapse in federal appropriations caused by the shutdown. According to the National Park Service Contingency Plan, the agency expected to furlough more than 9,000 of its 14,500 employees in case of a  shutdown.
That means the New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park and the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve — which includes the Chalmette Battlefield, Chalmette National Cemetery and the Barataria Preserve — are now closed to visitors.
The jazz park serves to educate visitors on the genre’s New Orleans roots and showcase local jazz artists and musicians. Located in the French Quarter on Decatur Street, it doubles as a fully equipped music venue and is the only U.S. national park solely dedicated to music.
Geovane Santos, an Afro-Brazilian guitarist, was scheduled to play at the jazz park last Thursday, the day after the shutdown began. He said was booked to play there as part of a lineup of artists for Hispanic Heritage Month.
“They canceled with us for [Thursday] because of the government shutdown and there is the quote-unquote promise of rescheduling the gig, but it’s uncertain if it’s going to happen or not,” Santos said.
Santos has performed at the site on several occasions with his own band, as well as with the park’s Arrowhead Jazz Band, which is composed of the site’s park rangers.
Santos said the park operates differently from most music venues in New Orleans in that it offers an upfront guarantee to performers, as opposed to paying performers on the back end based on ticket sales or bar sales.
He wonders what will happen to the funds that were intended to pay him and other performers whose shows were canceled.
“Folks think that the government shutdown only affects people who have direct services with the federal government, but … a musician in New Orleans going up for their business to play a gig and the gig is not happening because the federally funded venue is shut down,” Santos said.

A spokesperson for the National Parks Conservation Association, which supports the parks, pointed to calculations from the Parks Service showing that the jazz site and the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve helped drive more than $24 million in economic activity in their local communities last year.
“Visitors deserve to have a once-in-a-lifetime visit to New Orleans and its iconic national park sites, but until Congress works together to fund our parks and our government, that once-in-a-lifetime experience is on hold,” said Melissa Abdo, Sun Coast regional director for the organization, in a statement.
Abdo said the closures pose an environmental risk to the Barataria Preserve outside Marrero. Park rangers work to protect sensitive wetland ecosystems and migratory wildlife at the site.
Three other National Park Service sites in southern Louisiana were also closed — the Acadian Cultural Center, Prairie Acadian Cultural Center and Wetlands Acadian Culture Center.
Sean Clark is a New Orleans-based artist with art on display at the Wetlands Acadian Culture Center, which is located in Thibodaux. Clark’s collection, named “Some of US Call it Home,” features paintings and mixed media works exploring the “mundane diversity” of life in Louisiana and the South more broadly.
He sought out a national park, as opposed to a gallery or a museum, as a home for his artwork because he wanted the work to be accessible to all.
“Anytime I’m thinking about where I want my work to live, I want it to be in a place where people can come and absorb it without having to buy it,” Clark said.
The parks have free admission. But with federal funding stripped and employees furloughed, no one can come see Clark’s work.
Clark sees the shutdown as the latest barrier to artists’ work being disseminated — particularly the work of Black and brown artists, he said. He referenced other barriers like the widespread rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in recent years.
“I wouldn’t say [we’re] necessarily biting our nails, but we’re definitely in that state of awareness that these things can shift,” he said.
Senate Democrats and Republicans are in a standoff and have yet to agree on a proposal to fund the government going forward.

China stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans amid a new trade war this spring, triggering a price collapse and leaving farmers wondering what to do with the bumper crop they are now harvesting. Cranberry growers say they’re facing low prices and market uncertainty, too, as other countries turn away their products because of tariffs. 
Small wonder the latest ag economy barometer published by Purdue University on Oct. 7 found that nationwide farmers say their economic condition is weakening. Despite expected record-high corn and soybean yields, farmers report they expect weaker financial performance in 2025 than in 2024 and have a weaker capital investment outlook.
Yet even as optimism about the farm economy is fading, support for Trump among farmers remains strong.
Back in March, 70% of farmers who answered the Purdue survey said they believed tariffs would strengthen the agricultural economy in the long run. That number dropped steeply to 51% by September. Still a large majority — 71% – continue to believe the country as a whole is moving in the right direction, and 80% believe the Trump administration is likely or very likely to give them an aid package to compensate for the damage done by tariffs and trade wars.  
U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany (R-Wisconsin) reinforced this hope on the WRDN radio podcast from the World Dairy Expo in Madison last week. Tiffany, who is running for governor, was asked what he says to farmers who are “fed up” with Trump’s tariffs. He replied that Trump tariffs are not going away, but, he said of the administration, “they’re gonna use some of that tariff revenue, which is significant, to help farmers out. Because they know, I mean, President Trump has no better friends than the farmers of America.” 
Trump has suggested he will unveil another farm bailout as he did during his first administration, when China responded to steep tariffs by scaling back purchases of U.S. agricultural products. 
The problem with the bailout solution, says Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former senior adviser for rural development at USDA, is that the revenue generated by tariffs that Trump proposes to convert into handouts to farmers comes directly from the farmers themselves.  
“It’s not even like robbing Peter to pay Paul. It’s like robbing Peter to pay Peter,” Ajilore said in a phone interview Wednesday. “What’s happening is that there are tariffs on a lot of goods — looking at steel, aluminum, looking at fertilizers. So farmers are paying more for their inputs. We’re seeing this impacting these companies like Caterpillar, John Deere. And so you can say there’s a lot of revenue, but it’s coming out of the pockets of consumers, businesses and farmers.” 
If farmers are not already feeling seasick as the Trump administration spins the ag economy around on a cycle of tariffs and bailouts, the administration’s immigration crackdown is also making them queasy. 
A panel discussion at last week’s World Dairy Expo focused on a labor shortage made worse by a Trump administration that seems hell-bent on deporting the agricultural workforce.










Rocks are heavy. Trees are made of wood. Gravity is real. If we deport every single person that is working in the agriculture industry, the hospitality industry and the construction industry, all of those industries will shutter in a moment's notice.


– U.S. Rep Derrick Van Orden


The recent ICE action that scooped up 24 dairy workers in Manitowoc, most of whom had no criminal records, and deportations of entire crews of legally present H2A workers in Texas had farmers who attended the discussion worried.
“Taking hard-working employees off farms does not make communities safer,” said Brain Rexing, a dairy farmer from Indiana. He described the Hispanic workers on his farm as “way more than employees. — they work together with me and my family side to side.”
Like other farmers, he said, he goes to bed at night worrying about his workers and wakes up in the morning worrying about them. Instead of threatening farmworkers with deportation, Rexing and other farmers at the Expo said, Congress should finally get around to creating a year-round visa that recognizes their essential contributions to the U.S. economy. 
U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wisconsin) spoke to the group and assured them that the Trump administration has their back. He had personally spoken with Elon Musk he said. “I was like, hey, Elon, there’s two groups of people in the United States that we need to really watch out for. One of them are service members and veterans, because they gave us our freedom and keep us free. And the second one are our farmers, because they feed us. .. So he really zoned in on that and grasped it,” Van Orden said. 
Another “incredibly, incredibly strong proponent of the dairy industry,” he added, “is Tom Homan.”  Homan is Trump’s border czar and the architect of the family separation policy during the first Trump administration. “He was raised on a dairy farm,” Van Orden said. “So keep that in mind. There are some people in D.C. that understand what’s going on. We’re trying our best to help you. So I would just ask that you stay in the business and that God will bless you.”
It was not the most reassuring speech. But Van Orden also asked the dairy farmers in the room to support his proposal for a new system to make their workforce legal, which would impose a fine on employers and dairy workers and then require the workers to self-deport before returning to the country under a new federal program that would allow them to do their jobs legally. He introduced the bill in July and it was referred to the House Agriculture Committee, of which he is a member. 
The farmers, understandably, had a lot of questions.
What was their workers’ incentive to participate? How long would it take the government to process their paperwork, remove them from the country and let them back in again? How do they know they won’t be deported as soon as they come back? 
These are reasonable fears, given the terrifying scenes of ICE grabbing people off the street, busting down doors and zip-tying parents and children, sweeping up people with and without legal authorization to be in the country, whether or not they have committed any crime.
Recently, even the Trump administration’s Labor Department declared that the nation’s food system faces an emergency due to the administration’s aggressive mass deportation program, warning in a federal filing uncovered by the American Prospect that the immigration crackdown on agricultural workers has created a significant “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.” 
“The Department does not believe American workers currently unemployed or marginally employed will make themselves readily available in sufficient numbers to replace large numbers of aliens,” the filing states, contradicting Trump administration rhetoric about immigrants stealing American jobs.










Farmers are getting it in so many ways; their exports are down, their costs are up, and they’re losing their workforce.


– Gbenga Ajilore, former USDA economist


The solution proposed by Trump’s labor department is to pay H2A seasonal agricultural workers even less — offsetting the cost to employers of a terrified workforce that is disinclined to show up to work after ICE raids.
It seems like a weird solution, as David Dayen of the American Prospect observed, “since cutting wages across the sector will likely drive existing workers to look elsewhere for jobs.”
But there is a dark logic behind the move to slash wages for agricultural workers in the midst of the moral panic over immigration. Dayen quotes Antonio De Loera-Brust of the United Farm Workers, who sees a government threatening mass deportations working hand in glove with employers who benefit from a powerless immigrant workforce. 
“We call it the ‘Deport and Replace’ strategy,” De Loera-Brust said, “which is defined above all to make it easier for corporate agribusiness to exploit its workers, whether terrified undocumented residents or an unlimited pool of cheap foreign guest workers … The Trump administration would rather expand the abusive H-2A program than do right by the workers who are already here, feeding America for decades.”
This situation does not directly apply to Wisconsin dairy farms, since dairy workers are not eligible for H2A visas. But it was not at all clear from Van Orden’s remarks at the World Dairy Expo that he understands that fact. 
“The H2A program is broken and it sucks. There you go. That’s the whole press conference,” he said after he was introduced. Later, he referred to “all this garbage you’ve been dealing with, these H2As and H2Bs” insisting his own proposal for a new visa system would work better. In fact, dairy farmers are not dealing with the H2A (seasonal) or H2B (non-agricultural) visa systems at all.
Van Orden did acknowledge the difficult situation for the dairy industry, which depends on a labor force 60% to 90% of which is made up of immigrants who lack any sort of legal authorization to be in the country, since there is no such thing as a year-round visa for low-skilled work.
“Rocks are heavy. Trees are made of wood. Gravity is real. If we deport every single person that is working in the agriculture industry, the hospitality industry and the construction industry, all of those industries will shutter in a moment’s notice,” Van Orden declared.
But it’s unclear if his plan, the Agricultural Workforce Reform Act of 2025, will help.
One farmer asked if his workers would be barred from returning to the U.S. if they committed a traffic violation (a common concern in Wisconsin, where immigrants without legal papers cannot get a driver’s license). Van Orden fobbed him off, saying that would be a question for the executive branch to resolve through its rule-making process.
Several farmers listening to Van Orden affirmed that they supported Trump’s goal of securing the border, but added that they thought that mission had been accomplished. Now they hoped the administration would turn its attention to a new public safety issue — the threat mass deportations pose to the U.S. food supply.  
Farmers across the country seem inclined to give the Trump administration the benefit of the doubt. But the doubt is growing. 
“Farmers are getting it in so many ways; their exports are down, their costs are up, and they’re losing their workforce,” said Ajilore, the former USDA economist. Given all that, farmer sentiment “actually hasn’t really moved as much as you would expect, given what’s happening,” he said. He attributes it to a wait-and-see attitude among farmers who have faithfully supported Trump for years. But now, he added, “the impact is starting to really hit home.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-09 10:00:00+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Municipalities crank up the heat with report warning of financial ‘perfect storm’,Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/municipalities-crank-up-the-heat-with-report-warning-of-financial-perfect-storm/,A new report from the Massachusetts Municipal Association could put more pressure on Beacon Hill to reconsider stalled reforms amid bigger-picture economic uncertainty and a persistent “affordability” debate.,"MANY MUNICIPALITIES find themselves caught in a “tightening vice” of financial pressures that are making it increasingly difficult to avoid cuts to local schools and services, according to a new report that could ramp up pressure on Beacon Hill. 
Likening the confluence of factors to a “perfect storm,” authors said the combination of sluggish state aid growth and strict limits on local tax increases has trapped many local budget-writers in a difficult position with few options to absorb rising costs. Those effects have sizable geographic disparities, with many rural communities weighing school cuts that are less common in urban and suburban communities. 
The 12-page report from the Massachusetts Municipal Association and the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University stops short of recommending specific reforms, but it underlines a key tension as many communities struggle to balance their budgets within the constraints set by state law and Beacon Hill contends with that federal funding cuts that could upend the state budget.“Municipalities have been frugal, and any cuts they’re forced to make are now cutting bone,” MMA Executive Director Adam Chapdelaine said in a statement. “Even with the most valiant efforts to operate efficiently, city and town leaders simply can’t overcome the larger trends that are forcing them to make drastic reductions, felt by local residents and local businesses.” 
The report points to several structural factors that for years have strained municipal budgets, which pay for public education, police and fire departments, sewers, and other important local infrastructure.  
While many lawmakers and corner-office holders like to position themselves as staunch allies to cities and towns, authors found Massachusetts is behind the curve in terms of state aid. About 26 percent of local government revenue comes from state government in Massachusetts, five percentage points below the national average, the report said. 
One of the most significant funding streams Beacon Hill provides to municipalities is unrestricted general government aid, often abbreviated as UGGA. The Legislature and a series of governors have increased that line item over the years, but authors said the growth has not kept up with inflation. 
In fact, they said, inflation-adjusted UGGA has dropped 25 percent since 2010.

“Losing UGGA dollars, in this way, is particularly difficult for stressed municipal budgets, because it’s a rare stream of support that can be flexibly redirected to address evolving needs — whether that means extra road repairs after a pothole-cratering spring or additional tutoring for students struggling with pandemic learning loss,” the report said. 
Former Gov. Charlie Baker and lawmakers for years increased that local aid stream by the same rate as the projected growth in state tax revenues. That practice ended around the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, after which tax collections soared and Beacon Hill kept UGGA increases smaller, choosing to direct new dollars elsewhere. 
In the most recent budget cycle, the House proposed level-funding the UGGA account, which likely would have added more strain to municipal coffers. Lawmakers settled on a modest 1.1 percent increase in the final state spending plan, whose bottom line was about 5.4 percent higher than the prior year. 
Cities and towns have a limited menu of taxes they can impose to generate their own revenue, and many rely heavily on the property tax levy, which can only grow 2.5 percent annually under a voter-approved law often known as Proposition 2 ½. 
Local leaders can surpass the cap by securing voter approval, though report authors cautioned that route is “expensive, slow, short-lived, and logistically out of reach for the majority of Massachusetts municipalities.” Nearly 200 of the state’s 351 cities and towns, many of them rural, have not pursued a single override in the past 15 years, according to the report. 
Gov. Maura Healey wants to grant city and town halls more taxation authority as part of a wide-reaching bill she dubbed the “Municipal Empowerment Act,” which would allow communities to increase local taxes on meals, lodging, and vehicle registrations. 
While MMA members were quick to announce their support, the idea has failed to gain traction among House and Senate Democrats for nearly two years. The first iteration of Healey’s bill didn’t receive a vote before the term ended last year, and a refiled version this term is still awaiting committee hearings. 
The report suggested that, rather than being eager to spend, cities and towns have been far more “frugal” than the state government in recent years. 
From 2010 to 2022, inflation-adjusted municipal operating spending in Massachusetts grew 0.6 percent annually, authors said. That’s a lower rate than the 1 percent for all cities and towns nationally and, as the report put it, “vastly slower” than the 2.8 percent average growth in the state budget over the same span. 
“Proposition 2 ½ was intended to limit local spending, but real spending growth of 0.6 percent per year suggests the constraints may be too restrictive,” authors wrote. “This austere growth in spending has made it extremely difficult for cities and towns to attract staff, repair roads, and generally fund the essential services their residents demand.” 
The report identified sizable differences in how rural, suburban, and urban regions are feeling the strain, especially when it comes to education. A K-12 funding law known as the Student Opportunity Act directed hundreds of millions of state dollars more toward schools, but the report cautioned that “it would be flatly inaccurate to assume that these infusions have compensated for declines in UGGA — or even less defensibly, that they have actually left cities and towns better off.” 
Cities – especially Gateway Cities that face some of the most potent economic challenges – have seen a sizable increase in education aid over the past two decades. In the same span, the average municipality “has seen basically no change” and aid to rural communities has dropped overall, according to the report. 
Even after adjusting for population changes, authors said increases in state education aid for urban communities have far outpaced rural and suburban counterparts. 
Threading the needle for a solution could prove difficult. Policymakers continue to sweat over the state’s high cost of living, and they might worry that clearing the way for higher local taxes would contradict affordability goals. At the same time, legislative leaders will not feel eager to open the purse strings and pour out more local aid while they navigate federal funding cuts and shrinking tax collections. 
With a sweeping report in hand, city and town leaders are likely to get more vocal. 
“The cost of health care, energy, paving, construction and schools are contributing to cost increases that are outpacing revenue growth,” Newton Mayor Ruthanne Fuller said in a statement provided by MMA. “We have to change tracks and find new paths to invest sufficiently in the places we love and call home.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0219.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-09 06:59:35.118757

(Photo by Lexi Browing/West Virginia Watch)For years, West Virginia’s jails have been dangerously overcrowded, packed with people caught up in the failed war on drugs while counties hemorrhage millions trying to keep the lights on. Our jail crisis has cost lives, drained budgets and destroyed families. 
Now, instead of fixing this disaster, our state government has found a new way to make it worse by cramming in even more people, many of whom haven’t even committed a crime. 
Three of our regional jails – South Central in Charleston, Northern in Moundsville, and Eastern in Martinsburg — are renting beds to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for $90 a day to house immigrant detainees, according to a report last week from Amelia Ferrell Knisely of West Virginia Watch. Remember: Most immigration violations are civil offenses, not criminal ones. 
As of this week, all three facilities are operating well over capacity. Records show they currently house 1,368 people but have just 1,197 beds combined — including the 48 beds being held for ICE. 
The funds collected from the federal government ($4,320 per day) are a pittance compared to what cities and counties are paying to keep people locked up. 
Statewide, jails are 549 people over capacity. At a per-diem cost of $67.27 to counties and municipalities, that’s $36,931.23 a day we are spending on to pack our jails beyond capacity. 
But more important than budgetary concerns: West Virginia’s lawmakers never addressed a 2020 report by American Civil Liberties Union of West Virgniaa that determined our jails are also the deadliest in the nation. According to that report, West Virginia inmates died at 1.5 times the national rate. Deaths by suicide and overdose were more than twice the national rate. 
We at ACLU-WV pointed out at the time that jail conditions have meant death sentences for people accused of minor crimes. Now, we could be sentencing people to death who have committed no crimes at all. 
And rather than address these longstanding issues, lawmakers have gone on a criminalizing spree in recent legislative sessions. At one point, they even considered making fleeing an officer on foot a felony. 
Our criminal system is founded on the principle that we are all innocent until proven guilty, and not the other way around. People who are picked up on minor immigration violations like overstaying a visa are increasingly being treated as risks to public safety, which denies them a chance to post bond or await deportation proceedings at home. 
We’ve seen how abysmal the outcomes are when applied to drug offenses, and renting out rooms to signal allegiance to a political movement will only make matters worse.
West Virginia is blurring the distinctions between civil and criminal violations in the name of bowing down to the Trump administration and generating revenue for the state’s incarceration machine. This should concern every single one of us.

But enforcement has been partially stalled by questions of possible conflicts with federal law. Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman recently concluded the entire law is enforceable. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Kentucky pharmacists are hailing a decision by Attorney General Russell Coleman they say greenlights the state’s ability to fully enforce a new law meant to more tightly regulate prescription drug industry middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.
Benjamin P. Mudd
“It’s a positive thing allowing them to keep their doors open,” said Benjamin P. Mudd, executive director of the Kentucky Pharmacists Association.
“Definitely a win,” said Rosemary Smith, an Eastern Kentucky pharmacist and co-founder of the Kentucky Independent Pharmacy Alliance.
Now Mudd and Smith are calling on the administration of Gov. Andy Beshear to act on Coleman’s opinion of Sept. 24 and fully enforce the law meant to rein in what they say are predatory practices of PBMs that squeeze revenue from drugstores through processing prescription claims.
“We need help,” said Smith, who operates six community drugstores in Eastern Kentucky with her husband, Luther. 
Enforcement has stalled amid questions from the Beshear administration about possible conflicts with federal insurance law.
But so far, the state Department of Insurance has not provided information about how it plans to respond to Coleman’s decision that the law is fully enforceable. It did not respond to several requests from the Kentucky Lantern.
Smith said she’s heard nothing since Coleman’s opinion.
Reprieve for Kentucky’s independent pharmacies is saving Medicaid millions

“It’s been dead silence since that came out,” she said.
She and Mudd sent a letter Sept. 25 to Sharon Clark, Kentucky’s commissioner of insurance, requesting information within 15 days on how the state plans to respond to Coleman’s decision but have not received a response, they said.
Smith said more than 100 community pharmacies in Kentucky have closed in the last several years, in part because of the financial pressures of PBMs — some owned by national pharmacy chains such as CVS — that control much of the processing and payment of prescription drug claims.
“Our patients see these stores closing and they’re devastated,” she said.
Kentucky has about 950 pharmacies, about half of them independent.
The PBM industry claims it saves consumers money through better drug prices and more efficient processing of claims, according to information on the website of its association, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association.
But critics argue otherwise.
Senate Majority Floor Leader Max Wise, R-Campbellsville. (LRC Public Information)
The industry has come under fire from consumer advocates at the state and federal level. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission released a scathing report suggesting that PBMs are “profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies.”
Senate Bill 188, sponsored by Sen. Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, was meant to address complaints about PBMs in Kentucky through tighter regulation of their role in commercial health plans.  A  previous law, Senate Bill 50, sponsored by Wise in 2020, cut PBMs out of the state’s substantial Medicaid prescription drug market, a move officials have said saved Kentucky millions of dollars.
SB 188 passed overwhelmingly last year and was signed by Beshear, taking effect Jan. 1
Yet enforcement soon stalled amid questions about possible conflict with federal law
The state insurance department said it can enforce a provision of the law that sets a baseline for payment of claims, which pharmacists say has provided some financial relief.
But the department decided other parts of the law were preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, that sets minimum standards for private retirement and health plans.
Attorney General Russell Coleman
In particular, Kentucky insurance officials said in a June 30 bulletin that the department was barred from enforcing “anti-steering” provisions to restrict PBMs from steering business to their own drugstores, a practice that critics say is common. Kentucky officials also said the insurance department was limited in how it could enforce the law against the national PBMs based in other states.
But Coleman’s opinion rejected both of those claims, saying that based in part on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a similar Arkansas case, Kentucky is free to enforce all provisions of the law.
Wise, who sought the opinion, said he is pleased that it upholds the PBM law he sponsored. But he said he’s still waiting to hear from Kentucky officials how they plan to respond.
“It’s basically been very much silent,” he said.
Mudd, the director of the pharmacists’ association, said the state needs to adopt a clear plan for enforcement and stick to it.
Lack of enforcement “allows PBMs to manipulate the system and find loopholes,” he said.
Wise said the ultimate solution is federal law regulating the industry in all 50 states. Currently, individual states struggle to enact reforms, he said, adding:

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a lawsuit this week that calls on the federal government to strike down rules that allow the distribution of abortion drugs without an in-person doctor’s visit. It’s her latest attempt to place restrictions on out-of-state shipments of mifepristone, a medication that used to terminate pregnancies but that also has other life-saving and gynecological uses.    
Murrill filed suit Monday against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in Lafayette’s federal court district. It calls for the agency to reverse regulatory action it took in 2023 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing doctors to prescribe mifepristone through remote patients visits or – as the lawsuit claims – without any interaction with a medical professional.
“As a consequence, hundreds of unlawful abortions occur every month in Louisiana,” the lawsuit said 
A similar case to stop mail-order mifepristone went before the U.S. Supreme Court last year. Justices ruled unanimously that the doctors and medical groups who filed the lawsuit didn’t have legal standing as plaintiffs, and they did not consider the merits of the case.

Joining Murrill as a plaintiff in the new case is Rosalie Markezich, a Louisiana woman who said her boyfriend coerced her into taking mifepristone he obtained in October 2023 from a California doctor. 
Murrill has issued an arrest warrant for the physician, Dr. Remy Coeytaux. She’s the second health care provider the attorney general has attempted to take into custody to face charges in Louisiana.
The attorney general also wants to prosecute a New York physician, Dr. Margaret Carpenter, who she said shipped abortion drugs to a West Baton Rouge woman for her pregnant minor daughter. The physician and the girl’s mother were indicted in January for allegedly violating a 2022 state law that makes it a crime to knowingly cause an abortion through medication. 
States where abortion remains legal have thwarted prosecutors with laws that protect medical providers from being prosecuted in states where abortion is banned. Murrill and 14 other Republican attorneys general have urged Congress to strike down such “shield” laws.
Murrill also supported a first-of-its-kind state law Louisiana approved last year that treats mifepristone and misoprostol, another reproductive care medication, as Schedule IV controlled substances. The designation requires doctors and medical facilities to follow much stricter storage and dispensing guidelines.
Other uses for the drugs include treating ulcers, severe postpartum hemorrhages and to aid in the insertion of inter-uterine devices and diagnostic hysteroscopies. 
Doctors have said the new law has created difficulties for their patients obtaining the drugs from pharmacies for routine gynecological care. 
In defense of the Schedule IV law, Murrill labelled these firsthand reports from care providers and patients as attempts from the news media, political organizations and opposition candidates “to sow confusion and doubt” in order to “further their own financial and/or political agendas.”

(Photo via Getty Images)Nurse practitioner Michaela Maynard braced for a barrage of questions and concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine.
But most patients at Open Door Health in Providence, where Maynard works as senior clinical operations director, showed no hesitancy — even asking for the shot unprompted, despite the controversial guidance from government agencies over who should get it, and whether insurers would cover the cost. 
What Maynard was not expecting: telling her patients she couldn’t offer them the vaccine because the health center didn’t have any yet. While retail pharmacies already carry them, primary care providers and public health clinics are still waiting for their orders through the Rhode Island Department of Health, which buys COVID-19 shots through a bulk contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state health department was unable to place an order until the CDC finalized its vaccine recommendations.
“It feels really icky to have to create this barrier to getting the shot now for people who want it,” Maynard said in an interview on Wednesday. 
She won’t have to say “no” much longer. The CDC accepted the guidelines of its vaccine panel on Monday, kickstarting the order process for local care providers via the state health department. Maynard ordered 80 doses Tuesday — enough for two weeks of shots for clinic patients.
Vaccines are expected to arrive at primary care centers in Rhode Island by Oct. 14. But the bigger problem – combating public mistrust and misunderstanding about the vaccine — doesn’t have a firm end date.
Public skepticism and fear has accompanied COVID-19 — and its treatment — since 2020. New this year are the words and actions of federal agencies and administrators, casting new doubt on the efficacy of the booster shot, and making it harder to access for people who want it. 
“Nothing has changed except the politics,” said Dr. Amy Nunn, chief executive officer at the Rhode Island Public Health Institute, which runs Open Door Health among other programs. “The science is the same. But people are confused because of those mass media campaigns, which really unfortunately instill doubt and have a horribly detrimental impact on the average person.”



‘Abysmally low’ vax rate
 Open Door Health may be an anomaly because its LGBTQ+-friendly services cater to younger patients, and potentially, those with more awareness of science-backed recommendations, Nunn said. 
Fifteen miles south, at Brown University Health’s East Greenwich primary care office, Sen. Pam Lauria, a nurse practitioner, is fielding vaccine-related concerns from patients who never expressed much skepticism before.
“There’s always been politics around this vaccine, but I have people questioning who have never questioned before,” Lauria, a Barrington Democrat, said in an interview Wednesday. “This is a pretty significant medical breakthrough that got marred by politics. That’s always been the problem.”
Across Rhode Island, about half as many people have gotten the COVID-19 booster so far this year compared with last year, according to public tracking by the state health department.
Just over 21,000 doses of the latest COVID-19 shot have been administered in Rhode Island — equal to 2.0% of the state population — compared with nearly 44,000 at the same time in 2025.
The state vaccine data reflects shots in arms through Sept. 25 — just two weeks into the state-issued guidance around vaccine eligibility and coverage. And, the data only reflects shots distributed by retail pharmacists like Walgreens and CVS, which got their vaccines quicker because they buy directly from manufacturers.
Even so, that’s “abysmally low,” in the words of Nunn.
“The real issue is all the misinformation and disinformation,” Nunn said. “I think people are just confused.” 










Nothing has changed except the politics. The science is the same. But people are confused because of those mass media campaigns, which really unfortunately instill doubt and have a horribly detrimental impact on the average person.


– Dr. Amy Nunn, executive director at the Rhode Island Public Health Institute 


Indeed, the federal guidance remains on shifting sands. In August, the FDA adopted criteria restricting the updated shots to people 65 and older, or with underlying health conditions, prompting questions for access, and insurance coverage, for other groups.  In September, a key CDC advisory panel approved new guidelines granting access for all ages, subject to a “shared decision-making” caveat that first requires recipients to speak with a clinician. It wasn’t until two weeks later — an unusual delay compared with the standard process — that the CDC accepted the recommendation of its immunization panel, giving the green light to ship shots to primary care providers and state-run health clinics nationwide. 
Amid the federal tumult, Rhode Island officials took matters into their own hands, issuing a set of state health guidelines on Sept. 12 that guarantee access, and insurance coverage, for the shot to residents age 3 and older. More than two dozen other states have issued similar guidance, some of which have also formed inter-state alliances to help coordinate public health campaigns around immunization. Rhode Island is part of a 10-state collaborative of Northeast states, while a separate three-state group has formed along the West Coast. 
Given the recent changes, it’s too early to put much stock in Rhode Island’s COVID-19 vaccine uptake compared with last year, said Joseph Wendelken, a spokesperson for the state health department.

Deadly consequences
However, the seasonal spike on COVID-19 cases has started to hit Rhode Island hospitals and emergency departments. From Aug. 9 to Aug. 16, COVID-19 hospital admissions doubled from 15 to 31 people, according to state health department data. New admissions have remained around 30 people in the intervening weeks. There have been 97 COVID-19 related deaths as of Sept. 20. That’s a fraction of the 1,775 COVID deaths tracked through the same date in 2020, but on par with the deaths in 2025.
Nearly all of the people who died from COVID-19 this year — 90 of 97 — were 65 or older.
That’s the group Dr. Michael Fine worries about most. Fine, a former state health director who now heads a national advocacy group, Primary Care for All Americans, said the low COVID-19 uptake was “not a huge problem” for young, healthy people.
Seniors, and those with autoimmune conditions, on the other hand, will suffer far more without COVID-19 boosters to mitigate more serious side effects of contracting the virus. 
A larger percentage of Rhode Island seniors have received the booster than the general population — 5.7% so far this year. But it’s still less than half the 11% vaccination rate among adults 65 and older in 2025.
Like Nunn, Fine blamed the lackluster uptake on confusion and misinformation.
“It’s become a little more difficult to figure out how to get vaccinated,” he said. “No one is quite clear about the insurance coverage. All this stuff adds up, and the result is people get vaccinated less.”
And new state health guidelines don’t cut it, in Fine’s opinion.
“Getting people vaccinated isn’t just, you make a guideline,” Fine said. “You have to start placing ads on buses, and get the primary care community involved. I am not seeing any clear messaging reminding people to get vaccines.”
Lauria tries to leverage her longstanding relationships with patients to encourage them to roll up their sleeves. But waiting for doses to arrive to her office, she can only direct them to a retail pharmacy. And she has no idea whether those who verbally agree follow through.
“Obviously a captive audience is the best way to try to accomplish vaccinations,” Lauria said. “It will be good when our doses arrive.”
Getting the word out
Meanwhile, the state health department has “been doing a lot of communicating” with the public and providers about vaccinations, including COVID-19, with the intent of boosting vaccination rates, Wendelken said.
That includes the Sept. 12 press release announcing state guidelines for vaccine providers and insurers, and a $103,000 advertising campaign in English and Spanish that includes social media, digital networks, and print promotions at senior centers and housing facilities, Wendelken said in an email Wednesday.
In late March, the CDC abruptly canceled more than $30 million in unspent federal funding to Rhode Island for health department programs, including state-run vaccination clinics and tracking of contagious diseases. The funding was later restored, and has not been cut again, Wendelken confirmed.
However, maintaining and improving routine immunization rates for children and adults was identified as a “significant issue” in the state health department’s fiscal 2027 budget request. And federal pandemic aid to Rhode Island, which has supported most of the health department’s COVID-19 work, is winding down.
Federal funding for Rhode Island COVID-19 tracking, supplies and community work has diminished, from $83.4 million in fiscal 2025 to $15.2 million in the current, state fiscal 2026 budget. The health department proposed spending $7.5 million on its COVID-19 unit in fiscal 2027 using federal funding. This does not include state spending on vaccination clinics and public education for other immunizations such as the flu.
But the seasonal flu is just as harmful for vulnerable populations, and the flu shot is just as important, said Nunn. She worried that the distrust and doubt sown by federal leaders over COVID-19 vaccine might bleed over into other standard immunizations, including the flu shot.
“I think people are unfortunately becoming increasingly skeptical of things that are founded in decades of science,” she said.
Flu shots trailing
Fewer flu shots have been given out in Rhode Island so far this year, compared with last year. But the difference is less stark than with the COVID-19 booster — the 53,876 doses administered through Sept. 25 is just over 86% of doses given through the same time 2025, according to state health data.
And a slightly larger chunk of older adults already got their seasonal flu shot: 12.6% this year, compared with 12.2% through the same time last year. 
Rhode Island has historically been a national leader in state flu immunization rates — the highest in the country from  2017 through 2022. The 60% of residents who got a flu shot during the 2023-2024 season, the most recent data available, was second only to Massachusetts, according to KFF.
It’s still early in the flu season — even Fine hasn’t gotten his flu shot yet for that reason, he said. But the line between too early and too late is fast approaching.
“My fear is that by the time people realize there really is a disease and a vaccine helps, it will be too late,” he said.
Maynard rolled up her sleeve for a flu shot last week, and plans to get a COVID-19 booster as soon as they arrive at the clinic.
“I have older parents and little kids who are bringing all sorts of germs with them,” Maynard explained. “And, I think working with patients, it’s my duty to protect them.”
More than 180 community and school vaccination clinics are set to begin later this week across the state, offering free access to flu shots and COVID-19 boosters to students, teachers and the general public.

Tim Anderson, a Republican, are vying to represent House District 97 in the 2025 House of Delegates election. (Photos courtesy of campaigns) Just two years after House District 97 flipped from Republican to Democrat, the Virginia Beach district is being closely watched as a key race that could determine if Democrats will maintain their majority in the House, a hold they gained in 2023.
Democratic incumbent Michael Feggens is facing off against Republican former Del. Tim Anderson in the highly competitive contest. Combined, the campaigns have raised over $1 million, with Feggans pulling ahead with over $627,000 as of the end of August, compared to Anderson’s nearly $385,000.
Over half of the district voted for Kamala Harris for president in 2024, 53.1%, a major increase in Democratic votes from the 2016 election where Hillary Clinton narrowly won the district with 46.6%. In 2021, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the district by 50.6%.
The district has changed since 2021 when redistricting redrew many of its boundaries. In 2023, Republican Karen Greenhalgh ran against Feggans and lost. Anderson, who had represented House District 83, which was effectively eliminated in redistricting, said he did not want to run in a primary against the two other Republicans who ran for the new House District 97 seat. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for the state senate that year.
Anderson initially ran in 2020 during a previous trifecta of Democratic control of state government, in hopes of bringing more conservative representation. Now Anderson wants is back in the fight to try and take GOP control of the House.
“It’s exactly the same metrics of why I ran last time, it was a seat we have to win. I didn’t run for it last time because I didn’t want to challenge the incumbent, but she lost, and so I think it’s the right thing to do to try to claim that seat back for the team,” Anderson said.
Feggans is a 20-year Air Force veteran who previously interned for U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe before launching his campaign for delegate in 2022.
“We’ve been really focused on legislative solutions that focus on the environment, small businesses, and a lot on veterans and military families,” Feggans said. “I have a lot of contractors, government civilians, retired military, active duty military families (in my district), and that’s what a lot of our legislation has been focused on over the past two years.”
Here are the top issues in the district, which are shaping the race. 
Coastal flooding
Virginia Beach is on the frontlines of managing coastal flooding and erosion impacts from climate change. For Feggans, it has been one of his key concerns during his two years in the House of Delegates. He is in support of returning the state to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which Youngkin removed Virginia from because it tacked on an additional tax on utility bills. The program also generated millions of dollars that the state put towards energy efficiency and flooding mitigation projects, a process Feggans supports reviving.
“I had HB 673, which was the resilient Virginia revolving fund that really focused on low income areas and making sure that nature-based solutions are included in the grants that are sent out,” Feggans said. “My HJ 434, that in the shortest way to explain it was, we don’t have a formula for localities to figure out how much they should project out when, when requesting funding from the state and federal government.”
Anderson is strongly against Virginia being added back to RGGI. He also believes that a recent bond referendum in Virginia Beach that is funding a pumping project will be a major solution for  flooding in the district.
“It’s terrible to see that people’s houses, you know, have water coming into them when it rains heavily, but there is light at the end of the tunnel here that the pumping stations and the tidal flood gates that Virginia Beach has by 2029 and certainly by 2033 will be mitigated.”
Virginia Clean Economy Act
The Virginia Clean Economy Act, landmark 2020 legislation that put the commonwealth on the path towards an emissions-free future by requiring utilities to transition to 100% clean energy by 2050, is a major flashpoint in the district. The candidates stand firmly on opposite sides of the argument when it comes to ramping up renewable energy sources.
“We can use natural gas to solve our energy demands while we also are building the small modular reactors that, right now, are mostly going to come online for the data centers. But you know, the concept is, you know, Virginia needs more energy, and you can’t take the reliable energy offline,” Anderson said, who is calling for an end to VCEA. “It has to be repealed. It can’t even be fixed. It has to be repealed and start over.”
Feggans said he would be open to supporting changes to the VCEA that help support its original goals. He is focused on bolstering the offshore wind workforce after Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed his related bill earlier this year.
“I’ll be reintroducing that bill again next year,” Feggans said. “We’re seeing, unfortunately, that the federal government is not going to be a willing partner. We have to continue to, especially with the investments that have already been put into CVOW, how close it is to completion.”
Data Centers
The General Assembly is again expected to debate data centers’ impact on the state’s resources and how they should be regulated. While there are not as many in the Virginia Beach area as there are in the northern part of the state, the winner of the House District 97 race will have to weigh how the state will power the data centers and potentially regulate environmental impacts of the projects.
“There is no surefire answer on the data centers, especially, but for my Hampton Roads region perspective … we must look at making sure that the environmental impact is thought about first and the energy usage is thought about before moving forward with any potential projects,” Feggans said.
Anderson is in favor of making the data center companies pay a higher rate for their energy — an idea the state’s largest utility Dominion Energy recently proposed to state regulators —  and investing in the energy infrastructure needed to meet their demands.
“You know, these things are power suckers. They just absorb power. But they’re going to have nuclear, small modular reactors that are going to feed these, and they’re paying for them,” Anderson said. “They’re going to pay the higher rates for the small modular reactors. And I think that’s the right way to respond to companies that just suck in power.”
Affordability
Both candidates said they’re focused on bringing down costs for consumers where they can. Feggans supported a bill that would have provided first time home buyers with a $10,000 grant, but it didn’t pass the legislature. Feggans has also been part of a bipartisan committee investigating the impacts of federal cuts to Virginia agencies and programs and learning how it will impact residents of the commonwealth.
Anderson has campaigned heavily on repealing the car tax and removing the tax on veterans retirement, a pivotal issue in a district where veterans comprise 16% of the population. Anderson would also like to begin the phase out of the state’s income tax and said Virginia could offset some of those funds by mirroring Tennessee’s sales tax model.
Election day is Nov. 4.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Senate Democrats warned there would be significant consequences in future budget cycles for the University of Virginia if the school’s leadership accepts a proposed funding agreement with President Donald Trump’s administration that lawmakers said comes with strings attached, as outlined in a letter they sent to the institution’s leadership on Wednesday.
UVA, along with eight other institutions outside of the commonwealth, were offered the agreement on Oct. 1 in exchange for committing to the administration’s Compact for Academic Excellence. The compact’s specific requirements of the schools’ leaders include pledging to maintain neutrality on societal and political events, limit foreign entanglements such as capping the number of international students in the Student Visa Exchange Program, and meet strict equality and objective criteria in selecting students and staff.
Senate Democratic leadership — Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton — said that this agreement would represent an “unprecedented federal intrusion” into UVA’s autonomy and academic freedom.
“This is not a partnership; it is, as other university leaders have aptly described, political extortion,” the Oct. 8 letter states.
Democrats said that the compact contains contradictory and unworkable provisions, poses financial threats and introduces harmful operational changes. Leadership urged the institution to “cease” all consideration of signing the compact.

UVA and Senate Democratic leadership are currently locked in a lawsuit over a circuit court’s decision to prohibit multiple gubernatorial appointments to serve on the institution’s governing board. The suit also involves appointments for the Boards of Visitors at George Mason University and Virginia Military Institute. The Supreme Court has requested oral arguments in the case for Oct. 30, which indicates a decision is unlikely before the general election on Nov. 4.

“If the University of Virginia signs this compact, there will be significant consequences in future Virginia budget cycles,” the letter states. “As the leadership of the Senate with responsibility for appropriations affecting higher education, we will work with our colleagues to ensure that the commonwealth does not subsidize an institution that has ceded its independence to federal political control.”
In a statement, UVA Rector Rachel Sheridan and Interim President Paul Mahoney on Monday acknowledged they received the letter regarding the compact. A working group was created by Mahoney to advise him on a response letter to the administration.
“The Board of Visitors has confidence in that process and looks forward to working with President Mahoney to address this critical juncture in the relationship between the federal government and the American universities,” the statement read.
The president and rector encouraged the UVA community to share their thoughts on the proposal and added that “it would be difficult for the university to agree to certain provisions in the compact.” 
They said the school’s response will be “guided by the same principles of academic freedom and free inquiry that Thomas Jefferson placed at the center of the university’s mission more than 200 years ago, and to which the university has remained faithful ever since.”
By Wednesday evening, UVA Vice-Rector Porter Wilkinson, Sheridan and Mahoney signed a letter to the Senators acknowledging their concerns about the proposed compact agreement and assuring them that they “have no intention of abandoning the university’s principles.”
The American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAUP) announced its opposition to the administration’s compact in a statement, adding that it strongly opposes any partnership alternative that would “eviscerate essential freedoms” and “promote instability.”
The Faculty Senate of the University of Virginia joined the AAUP in passing a resolution that said the compact contains provisions “antithetical” to the mission and traditions of the university and would endanger the institution’s independence and integrity.
Nine institutions were asked to join the compact: Brown University in Rhode Island, Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Virginia.
According to media reports, universities are expected to submit comments back to the administration by Oct. 20 with the goal of having a signed agreement by Nov. 21.

Changes in student loan repayment plans have coincided with the government shutdown, which could leave Virginia borrowers in limbo.
The Department of Education announced plans to send home 87% of its employees, including around 85% of Federal Student Aid employees, during the shutdown, according to its posted contingency plan. This comes after a promise in March to reduce staff by nearly around 50%.
Federal student loans will be disbursed despite the shutdown. Borrowers will still be expected to make payments on outstanding student debt.
The U.S. government has attempted to find remedies in response to the steady rise of student loan debt, but has been largely unsuccessful, according to Alan Collinge, founder of Student Loan Justice.
Dept. of Ed hits FAFSA deadline early; Va. colleges, universities say rollout is going ‘smoothly’

“None of those plans are at all trustworthy,” Collinge said. “My best estimate is that well over 90% of all borrowers in past programs have been disqualified out of those plans before getting the promised forgiveness.”
Former President Joe Biden introduced the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan to help combat student loan debt.
The program relied on an income-driven repayment plan that could have seen people’s debt gone in as few as 10 years. The Biden administration estimated that more than 20 million people could benefit and encouraged people to apply.
Repayment plans were overhauled under President Donald Trump’s budget reconciliation bill. This includes the SAVE plan being axed entirely by 2028 at the latest, according to the National Consumer Law Center.
Interest charges restarted for people enrolled in SAVE as of Aug. 1, which means the loans will collect interest while borrowers search for a new plan.
Virginia is one of the leading states in student loan debt, according to federal data. In Virginia, 55% of college graduates have student loan debt, and the average debt exceeds $40,000.
(Chart by VCU Capital News Service)
Student loan debt sits at $1.8 trillion nationwide in 2025, according to the Federal Reserve. The federal student loan debt in Virginia totals $44.9 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
For comparison, Virginia’s federal student loan debt is 1.5 times higher than the state’s annual education budget, which includes K-12, higher education and administrative support spending, according to the state budget. The loan amounts could rise as tuition increases.
Annual interest accrued from Virginia borrowers totals $2.8 billion, according to the grassroots organization Student Loan Justice, which was founded in 2005.
In some states, the amount of interest taken from student loans rivals earnings from major industries, according to Collinge. Virginia’s combined soybean, chicken, pork and tobacco exports compete with the annual interest from these loans, he said.
In-state students have seen tuition costs rise in recent years, with the average of a 2% increase from 2024-2025. Some Virginia colleges and universities like Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia State University have seen an over 4% increase in tuition and fees in that time.
This uncertainty and the rise of loan interest rates affects financial stability and career choices, according to Amy Pridemore, executive director for the VCU Financial Success Center.
People now wait longer to start families and are unable to buy homes and cars, Pridemore said. Student loan debts take precedent over other debts like mortgages, which halts the ability to make major purchases that build assets and wealth over time.
“That means that money is not being sent elsewhere in the economy,” Pridemore said. “They might not have as much discretionary spending because there’s so much of their disposable income that is going to pay down these student loans instead.”
Student loan debt is one of the only forms of debt that cannot be cleared when someone files for bankruptcy. It is relatively easy to pile on the debt when in higher education because so few people are unaware of the implications of the loans they take on, according to Pridemore.
“Even if you got rid of all of your other debt, student loans will live with you forever until they’re paid off,” Pridemore said.
There are more borrowers over the age of 35 in Virginia, but they borrowed less money per person, according to the Department of Education. People over 35 owe $29 billion, nearly double the amount compared to people under 35 who owe nearly $16 billion.
Student loan debt affects people in a variety of professions. Even perceived high-paying careers like doctors struggle to repay the accumulated debt, according to Michael York, a registered nurse in Richmond. Student loan companies monopolize higher education, and many have little choice but to deal with it, he said.
“I don’t fault people for having to take student loans,” York said. “I just wish it wasn’t like for-profit companies that are giving out student loans and making money off people who are trying to further their education.”
The Trump administration has also been accused of taking borrowers’ tax refunds with no required notice to offset the student loans, according to Democratic Maryland lawmaker U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin. This comes after the administration announced in April that it would resume collection activity after a half-decade pause due to COVID-19.

Kennedy Jr.’s job performance and the federal government’s evolving vaccine policy, according to a poll released Thursday by the nonpartisan health organization KFF. In addition, the vast majority of those surveyed have heard the unproven claims made by President Donald Trump, Kennedy and others in late September that taking acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, during pregnancy could be one possible environmental factor in a child later being diagnosed with autism. A total of 77% of the people KFF polled said they knew of the statements, though whether people believe the claims, which have yet to be established by the medical community, varied. Only 4% of those surveyed said it is “definitely true” that taking Tylenol during pregnancy increases the risk of the child developing autism, and 35% said the claim is “definitely false.” Thirty percent said it is “probably true” and 30% said it is “probably false.”Combined, 65% said it’s either probably or definitely false to say that taking acetaminophen during pregnancy increases the chance of a child developing autism, a complex disorder that experts believe is the result of both genetic and environmental factors.When broken down by political party, 86% of Democrats, 67% of independents and 43% of Republicans said the claims were either probably or definitely false. The survey shows 59% somewhat or strongly disapprove of how Kennedy is handling his new role at the top of the country’s public health infrastructure. The level of support changes considerably depending on political party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats, 64% of independents and 26% of Republicans disapproving. A slightly higher number, 62%, either somewhat or strongly disapprove of the United States’ vaccine policy. A similar trend emerged when those polled were broken up by political parties. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats, 67% of independents and 31% of Republicans somewhat or strongly disapproved of vaccine policy. The survey shows a declining share of Americans have faith in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide trusted information about vaccines, compared with previous KFF polls in September 2023 and earlier this year. A total of 63% of respondents two years ago trusted the CDC on vaccines, but that has declined to 50%. Democrats’ faith in the CDC’s vaccine recommendations has dropped from 88% two years ago to 64%, independents have gone from 61% to 47% and Republicans have remained relatively steady, only going from 40% to 39%. Across political parties, a person’s own doctor as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association remain broadly trusted for vaccine information. Eighty-three percent said they trust their doctor or health care provider, 69% believed information from the American Academy of Pediatrics and 64% had faith in the AMA. The poll of 1,334 adults took place from Sept. 23 to Sept. 29 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for the full survey. Questions broken down by a person’s political ideology had a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points.",,,,2025-10-09 05:56:37.280082

Just a week or two after the Federal Emergency Management Agency updated flood maps across the Charles, Nashua, and Merrimack watersheds this past July, residents who found their homes newly included in the updated flood zones complained to city officials that they would likely need to pay for flood insurance for the first time.
Eventually, those concerns reached Curt Bellavance, Peabody’s director of planning and community development. For the 100 or so households in Peabody now in FEMA’s special flood hazard area and an untold number of others across the three watersheds, the bill for increased flooding in Massachusetts is literally coming due.
“They all got a notice from their mortgage company that said, ‘Oh by the way, you owe this premium,’” Bellavance told CommonWealth Beacon in an interview. “People were like, ‘What? I’m not in the floodplain. Is this new?’”
The frequency and severity of heavy precipitation events and flooding is increasing in Massachusetts and is projected to continue to grow over time. While coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, inland communities located near rivers and streams are also at risk and have experienced some of the most devastating flooding and corresponding property damage in recent years.
In Massachusetts, where housing markets are already strained, FEMA’s recent expansion of its flood maps is butting up against the state’s drive to supercharge new construction. In February, the Healey administration released a plan to add 222,000 housing units by 2035, but the increase in flooding — and the fact that it’s not clear how many existing houses are now encompassed by the new maps — introduce more risk into the process, as more parcels fall into flood plains and require additional insurance to qualify for mortgages.
When a home or business is placed in a FEMA flood zone a government-backed mortgage lender will have to require flood insurance for the property. About 55,000 homes in Massachusetts already have flood insurance, two-thirds of which have their flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program, according to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs
“When someone says, ‘I grew up in this house, and I bought it from my parents and we never had water in 65 years,’ it’s hard to argue with that and say, ‘Well, you’re in the floodplain now,’” Bellavance said.
The financial impact of these new maps on Massachusetts property owners is far from clear.
FEMA doesn’t track how many new households or properties are added to a flood zone when new maps are created, according to an agency spokesperson. The state doesn’t have that information, either.
That leaves it up to municipalities to figure out how to translate FEMA’s maps into tangible, actionable information for their residents to know their risks and to identify which households could be required to purchase flood insurance — before their lender comes knocking on the door.
Some communities, like Peabody, have calculated the new number. In Wellesley, an additional 150 parcels of land are now in the FEMA flood zone compared with the prior map, said Eric Arbeene, the town’s planning director. And in Brookline, there are 33 additional properties in the flood zone under FEMA’s new maps, with five properties previously in the flood zone removed from the map, according to Maria Rose, an environmental engineer at Brookline.
Others, like Middleton and Boxford, don’t have a sense of the scale of how the new changes impact their municipality’s residents, though in general more people are at risk of flooding.
“The process was broken, in terms of getting the information out to people that were impacted,” Bellavance said.

Those data gaps and thorny flood risk questions involved in the map-making process are only bound to generate more scrutiny in Massachusetts.
New FEMA flood maps for the Blackstone, Hudson-Hoosic, and Housatonic watersheds and in Worcester, Franklin, and Hampshire counties are all expected to move forward by the end of 2027, according to FEMA. The state estimates that some of those areas will be getting their first flood zone updates since the early 1980s.
The new maps that FEMA rolled out for the Nashua, Merrimack, and Charles watersheds earlier this summer better incorporate data around inland flooding — a process that first started a decade ago, the agency said.
Healey is using the new maps to further justify her environmental bond bill, which is sitting before the Legislature and would direct about $400 million to upgrading inland dams, flood control projects, and coastal infrastructure.
“The legislation also ensures experts in disaster prevention and housing production shape the building code and requires flood risk disclosures to protect homeowners and renters,” said Maria Hardiman, a spokesperson for the state energy and environmental affairs office. “These changes will help prepare Massachusetts for the future.”
Pricing in flood risk over time could lead to smarter decisions about where people choose to live, where the state should invest in new housing and spur property owners to protect themselves with flood insurance to minimize costly damages. The vast majority of U.S. homeowners aren’t prepared for that risk: Just 4% of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance despite 99 percent of counties being impacted by flooding since 1996.
But policymakers, advocates, and homeowners are sifting through FEMA’s updates skeptical of how best to make use of the new federal data. By law, the agency only takes historical flood data into account when establishing the flood zones used to set insurance rates, not forward-looking projections that model future conditions and incorporate the effects of climate change.
That’s created large disparities between FEMA’s flood maps and the actual risk experienced by residents. A 2023 report from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council found that 96% of flood damage claims filed after the historic 2010 downpours were in areas outside of FEMA’s special flood hazard areas.
Meanwhile, an analysis by First Street, a climate risk financial modeling company that does incorporate future projections, says that there are tens of thousands more properties in flood zones in several Massachusetts counties than FEMA’s flood maps show. For example, there are 42,447 properties in the flood zone in Middlesex County compared to the 9,093 properties identified by FEMA, according to First Street’s estimates.
“We don’t use FEMA maps that much, and we encourage communities to also not use them for planning purposes,” said Julie Wood, climate resilience director at the Charles River Watershed Association. “I know there’s a regulatory structure around the National Flood Insurance Program that these maps are central to, and that’s, of course, critically important. But our focus is on climate resilience planning and planning for the future that we know is coming, and these FEMA maps are not a good tool for that.”
Massachusetts communities are navigating how best to build housing given their flood risks at a time in which the state is confronting a large-scale housing shortage.
Peabody is preparing for a new 128-unit affordable housing building in its downtown section that’s fully permitted, Bellavance said. That section, near North River, has historically had flooding issues and the city has worked to improve stormwater management there.
In Wellesley, where the median home sold for $2.4 millon in August, the town is weighing a proposal from a developer to knock down several office buildings in a flood plain on the bank of the Charles River to construct a 28-unit, four-story multi-family housing building with two parking spots per unit, Arbeene said.
“There is a housing crisis. Everybody is aware of that,” Arbeene said. “I do think you can develop housing in a responsible manner. Development pressure in Wellesley is intense. But you don’t want to build in a risky area. That doesn’t work for anybody. I think there’s a way you can do both, and that’s why we have a flood plain bylaw and review process to ensure any development adheres to proper protocol.”
In order for communities to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program, municipalities must adopt the new maps and minimum zoning and building code standards for structures within the flood zones, like adequate draining requirements and additional permitting for development in the floodplain, as the state model bylaw recommends.
On the other side of town from the proposed housing project, Wellesley is confronting the fact that the town’s high school is now, according to FEMA’s new maps, in the flood zone. FEMA previously designated the high school in the flood zone during the agency’s last update of the town’s flood maps in 2012, Arbeene said, but the town successfully challenged that designation — a process any property owner can go through to contest FEMA’s determination.
“I think most people find it burdensome,” to be newly placed in the flood zone, said Theresa Hatton, CEO of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors. “But we live in New England, and there’s so much land that is in the floodplain, therefore anyone buying a home should investigate the flood maps. If individuals opt not to buy flood insurance, if a flood event occurs and they have no insurance to help them rebuild, they’re very frustrated by that, as well.”
The release of the latest maps put Wellesley’s high school right back in the flood zone. The town decided not to challenge that decision this time and instead pay the $3,200 annual flood insurance cost, Arbeene said. “Sometimes, it’s a cost-benefit decision to determine the cost of challenging the maps and hiring the engineers and consultants versus just paying the flood insurance,” he added.
Those types of choices are likely playing out across the state, with more still to come as FEMA finalizes more maps.
To better plan for a warmer and wetter world, state and local officials and nonprofit groups are building more predictive and comprehensive flood tools to inform development decisions.
In Peabody, for instance, Bellavance said the city is reviewing a draft resiliency plan that includes models for projected conditions decades down the line. The city aims to adopt new zoning regulations around that plan early next year.
The Charles River Watershed Association, in partnership with 20 municipalities, has developed its own flood modeling to support planning and necessary infrastructure upgrades along the river. The state, too, has developed its own coastal sea level rise projections and is working on similar efforts for inland flooding.
“People are concerned,” Arbeene said. “They don’t want to be in a flood zone. We have been getting calls from people who said, ‘Hey, my mortgage lender said that I’m in the flood zone, can I get out of it? How do I get out of it?’”

That means schools are still serving federally subsidized meals and states are distributing funding for the federal food stamp program. For now.
If the shutdown drags on and federal dollars run out, states can only keep programs going for so long. States may choose to pay for some services themselves so residents keep their benefits.
But this time, state leaders have new worries about getting reimbursed for federal costs once the federal spending impasse is resolved. That’s traditionally been the practice following a shutdown, but the Trump administration’s record of pulling funding and targeting Democratic-led states has some officials worried about what comes after the shutdown.
Many states already struggled to balance their own budgets this year. And some fear going without federal reimbursement for shutdown costs could force states to make painful cuts to their own budget priorities.
Trump has crushed offshore wind plans, but states haven’t quite given up hope

Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine, a Democrat, said the administration has not made good on its word to states in recent months — freezing some congressionally approved funding and cutting already awarded grants. So it’s likewise unclear whether the federal government will follow previous practice and reimburse states for covering shutdown costs of crucial federal programs such as food assistance.
“I think everything is a risk with this administration. … We in the states are kind of left holding the bag yet again as the federal government tries to sort out what it wants to be when it grows up,” he told Stateline.
Nevada entered the shutdown with more than $1.2 billion in reserves. Last week, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office said in a statement that state funds would be adequate to cover “a short period of time with minimal disruption to services.”
But the governor’s office said a shutdown of more than 30 days would cause more significant challenges for the state.
Lombardo’s office did not respond to Stateline’s questions. But last week, it released a three-page document on the shutdown, saying it expected the federal government to reimburse states once the budget stalemate is resolved.
“As D.C. works through its issues, our administration will continue to support Nevadans in any way we can throughout this unnecessary federal government shutdown,” Lombardo said in the statement.

While mandatory programs such as Medicaid and Social Security continue to send funds to beneficiaries during the shutdown, funding for other safety net programs such as food assistance are more uncertain. The federal government told states there were enough funds for the food stamp program to cover October benefits, though the special food program for women, infants and children may run out of money sooner.
By furloughing workers and halting federal spending, the shutdown could cost the national economy $15 billion per week, President Donald Trump’s economic advisers estimated.
The White House says a prolonged shutdown will affect the economies of every state by reducing employment, federal benefits and consumer spending. White House estimates say this could cost Michigan $361 million per week in lost economic output, for example, while Florida could lose $911 million each week.
‘Fend for themselves’
Some federal services are shuttered during a shutdown: The Environmental Protection Agency has ceased many research, permitting and enforcement efforts, and official jobs data is no longer being released. Federal funds for other programs, including food assistance, are expected to last through the end of the month. But states can elect to spend their own funds on these programs, which were previously authorized by Congress and state legislatures.
Before the shutdown, states were stockpiling reserve funding. The National Association of State Budget Officers reported most state budgets this year maintained or increased rainy day funds. At the same time, state and local governments are borrowing record amounts: As much as $600 billion in municipal bonds is projected to be issued by the end of 2025.
“So states and localities are kind of getting the message they really need to fend for themselves much more than they ever had,” said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that works to support public sector workers.
State leaders brace for ‘heavy lift’ from Medicaid, food stamp changes

Since January, the Trump administration has stripped states and cities of billions of dollars that Congress approved for education, infrastructure and energy projects. Glasgall said that record leaves states with legitimate concerns about getting repaid for their shutdown-related expenses — a prospect that would likely spark even more lawsuits from Democratic-led states.
“They’ve already, before the shutdown, started rolling back federal funding, and I don’t see any reason why they would stop now,” he said. “The recissions that have been announced are pretty harsh, and it’s money we’re expecting and not getting.”
The last shutdown, which lasted five weeks during Trump’s first term, delayed billions in federal spending and reduced gross domestic product — the value of all goods and services produced — by $11 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2019. Experts say states were repaid for costs they incurred providing federal services during that shutdown.
In Minnesota, State Budget Director Ahna Minge said staff have been studying previous shutdowns. But at a news conference with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz last week, she characterized this shutdown as “unpredictable.”
“The current federal administration may not follow the historic playbook,” she said.
Walz said farmers would be among the first hit as the federal Farm Service Agency has ceased operations in the middle of the state’s harvest season. Among other duties, that agency works on disaster assistance and processes loans during harvest to protect farmers against commodity price fluctuations.
Minge said Minnesota officials think programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children have enough existing federal funds to operate through October. But she said the state budget cannot backfill all the commitments made by federal programs.
“What we know is that the longer a shutdown lasts, the greater the impact to state programs and services,” she said.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, has pledged to use state dollars to keep WIC afloat if needed, The Associated Press reported. And Colorado lawmakers set aside $7.5 million just before the shutdown to keep WIC running.
Already under strain
In Maryland, the shutdown is compounding the economic instability from Trump’s ongoing efforts to shrink the number of federal employees, agencies and spending.
With more than 160,000 federal employees, Maryland’s economy relies heavily on the federal workforce. The Trump administration has said it may deny back pay to hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers, despite a law he signed in 2019 guaranteeing such back pay.
States scramble to plug transportation funding holes

Chief Deputy Comptroller Andrew Schaufele told lawmakers last week that a shutdown could cost the state $700,000 per day in lost tax revenue.
Democratic Gov. Wes Moore pledged to continue funding some federal programs, but said the state would not tap into its rainy day funds to do so.
“We’re going to continually evaluate how long we can go,” he said at a news conference.
As for getting repaid, Moore spokesperson David Turner told Stateline that the state had received no indication that the federal government would deviate from past practice, “but we are monitoring closely.”
This fiscal uncertainty hits states as they are already struggling to respond to the strain of federal agency layoffs and cuts in the major tax and spending law Trump signed this summer. The law slashed billions in social service funding and created costly new bureaucratic burdens for states, which administer Medicaid and food assistance programs.
“There’s no way, really at this point, to sort of assess with any level of confidence what’s going to happen when you also have these massive layoffs that were going on pre-shutdown,” said Lisa Parshall, a professor of political science at Daemen University in New York. “There’s just a real sense from states and localities — and I think rightly so — that that kind of reliability of the federal government is now in question.”
It may not be a question of whether states are reimbursed for their shutdown expenses, but which states are reimbursed, Parshall said. The Trump administration has publicly targeted funding of liberal-led states and cities over policy disagreements, raising the possibility it could do something similar with the shutdown.
“Whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, you know, you could argue,” she said. “But it’s definitely a thing that seems to be adding to this level of uncertainty — this shutdown feels different.”
In California, officials just closed a nearly $12 billion shortfall when negotiating the budget that was approved in June. The budget deficit is expected to grow to more than $17 billion next year, said H.D. Palmer, spokesperson for the State of California Department of Finance, which advises the governor and state agencies on budget issues.
“There isn’t a long-term, open-ended line of credit available if this drags out,” he said of the federal government shutdown.
The depth of reserve funds available varies by federally funded program, he said. CalFresh, California’s name for its Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, has enough funds to cover food stamp benefits for this month, but anything beyond that is uncertain.
“If the duration of this is in the matter of days, it will be an inconvenience, but should not pose a massive problem,” he said. “However, if it does drag out for an extended period of time, then clearly it’s going to be a problem.”

Republish photo only with original story.)A pair of Ohio Republican lawmakers want public schools and public universities to teach positive impacts of Christianity on American history. No other religion is mentioned in the bill. 
Republican state Reps. Gary Click and Mike Dovilla recently introduced Ohio House Bill 486, also known as the Charlie Kirk American Heritage Act. Kirk, a political activist who founded Turning Point USA and often spoke about his Christian faith, was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.

The bill does not create a new law but clarifies the law, Click said during Tuesday’s House Education Committee meeting. 
“What it does is it removes the invisible shackles that often hinder a full transparency in the teaching of American history,” he said during his sponsor testimony. “We are not inviting instructors to teach doctrine or to proselytize … we’re simply affirming what is already in the law that exists.”
“The United States stands alone in history, in the history of nations, through the overwhelming influence of Christianity on our founding,” Click claimed.
The religions of America’s Founding Fathers had wide variation but most were Protestant. Many came from the Anglican, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist churches, with some Quakers, Lutherans, and Dutch Reformed, and some Catholics.
A significant minority of the founders were Unitarians or Deists, believing in a supreme creator but not in divine intervention. This included Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Paine.
With the Establishment and Free Exercise clauses as the first and second clauses in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, the U.S. Constitution stands as history’s most notable document establishing religious freedom in a nation at its founding.
Click said he has talked to teachers who are afraid to mention Christianity’s influence on history. 
“If we teach it, we’re going to be accused of proselytizing, and we’re going to be accused of trying to convert people to Christianity,” Click said is something he has heard from teachers. He stressed his bill is permissive, not a requirement. 
“This legislation allows Ohio’s educators, when teaching American history, to include instruction on the positive influence of religion — particularly Christianity — on the development of our nation’s ideals, its civic institutions, and its culture,” Dovilla said. “This is not about rewriting history. It is about restoring honesty and depth to the way we teach it.”
The bill outlines several examples that could be taught including the history of the pilgrims, the signers of the Declaration of Independence, the religious influence on the U.S. Constitution, Benjamin Franklin’s call for prayer at the constitutional convention, the separation of church and state, the role of the Ten Commandments “in shaping American law,” the Civil Rights movement, and the impact of evangelist Billy Graham, among others, according to the bill’s language. 
State Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna, pointed out how the bill only mentions Christianity. 
“The reason it focuses directly on Christianity is because those are the complaints that I have received personally, is that people don’t feel comfortable teaching that,” Click said. “And quite honestly, it is Christianity that was the predominant religion that our nation was established.” 
ALCU of Ohio Legislative Director Gary Daniels said the bill is unnecessary, arguing teachers and professors are already allowed to teach about religion in the context of American history. 
“The intentions are, quite obviously, to go beyond all of that which is constitutionally permitted and essentially encourage school staff and university staff to propagandize students,” he said. 
Baby Olivia Act 
State Rep. Melanie Miller, R–Ashland, testified in support of her new bill that would require Ohio public schools to show a video about fetal development to students starting in the third grade.
Ohio House Bill 485 would require showing the three-minute Meet Baby Olivia video and an ultrasound video at least three minutes long. The Baby Olivia video is produced by Live Action, which advocates against abortion. 
“The miracle of life is not something that can be easily explained,” Miller said during her testimony. “By equipping students with the resources and knowledge about the remarkable stages of life, we can promote informed discussion grounded in science and respect for human biology.” 
Planned Parenthood calls the “Baby Olivia” video “inaccurate, misleading, and manipulative.” 
CROWN Act
Ohio state Reps. Juanita Brent, D-Cleveland, and Jamie Callender, R-Concord, spoke in favor of their bill that would ban discrimination against natural hair in public K-12 schools. 
House Bill 415 is also known as the CROWN Act, which stands for Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair. 
The bipartisan bill prohibits discrimination against someone’s hair texture and protective hair styles such as braids, locs, twists and afros under Ohio’s Civil Rights Laws. 
“We know that hair discrimination is still alive and well,” Brent said. “We’ve had situations where … a young lady went to school and she had to get sent home because she had some Afro puffs.”
“We want to make sure our kids are not removed from school. We want to make sure that unnecessary disciplinary actions are not occurring to our kids. We want to make sure that kids feel seen.”
This is the fourth legislative session in a row Brent has introduced the CROWN Act. The bill passed the Ohio House in the last General Assembly, but only had sponsor testimony in the Ohio Senate.
“We were rushing to get it out of committee, to get it on the floor as we approached the last days of session, and it just didn’t make it across the finish line,” Callender said. 
Twenty-seven states and Washington D.C., have already enacted the CROWN Act. A handful of Ohio cities — including Columbus, Akron, Cleveland Heights, Cleveland Heights, and Cincinnati — have already enacted the CROWN Act at the local level. 
“By passing this bill, we affirm that diversity in our schools should be celebrated, not punished,” Brent said. “Our children deserve to feel safe, seen and valued for who they are.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderIt has taken some time, but the American public is finally beginning to understand what Republicans in Washington are doing to our nation’s health care system, including the Affordable Care Act that now covers an estimated 24 million people.
“When the tax credits expire this year my own adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE,” one North Georgia mother exclaimed this week on social media. “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!
“WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ABSOLUTELY INSANE COST OF INSURANCE FOR AMERICANS,” she concluded in all capital letters.
That exasperated mother is Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican representing Georgia’s 14th Congressional District. And her adult children are not the only ones experiencing sticker shock because tax credits are expiring at the end of this year. 
For example:
“On average, a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see yearly premium payments rise by over $22,600 in 2026, after accounting for an annual premium increase of 18%,” according to health care analysts at KFF. “This would bring the cost of a benchmark plan to about a quarter of this couple’s annual income.”
If you’re wondering what the government shutdown is all about, this explains a lot of it. Democrats have been warning for months that the ACA subsidies that keep health insurance affordable will expire at the end of the year without congressional action, but as Greene notes in her typically flamboyant fashion, Republican leaders have done nothing to address the problem. Democrats say that if the subsidies are reinstated, they’ll provide enough Democratic votes in the Senate to fund the government. In response, Republicans say nothing.
Current projections are that without such action, 450,000 Georgians will be forced to drop their insurance coverage through the ACA because they can no longer afford it, and that in turn will send ripples throughout the state’s health care infrastructure. According to a second analysis, this one by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, that would mean a loss of $1.6 billion in revenue to hospitals and other health-delivery systems in Georgia, with particular impact on struggling rural hospitals. 
But if you believe Republican leadership in Washington, none of this is happening. They continue to claim that Democrats are demanding free health care for illegal immigrants as their price for reopening the government, while Democrats continue to insist that is not true. Democrats point out, correctly, that longstanding federal law bars illegal immigrants from coverage under Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, and Democrats say they have no intention of trying to change that.
Essentially, Republicans are caught in a trap of their own making. Polls continue to show stronger and stronger support for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Two-thirds of Americans now say they support the program, compared to just 33% who are still opposed. Last month, a KFF poll found that 78% of Americans support extending the tax credit subsidies, while just 22% oppose it.
That 22%, however, is largely the MAGA base. With Republicans in charge of the House, Senate and White House, any move to extend the Obamacare subsidies would have to come with Republican approval and Republican votes. That would be seen as a deep, intolerable act of betrayal by the GOP base, which has been taught that Obamacare is the work of the devil. 
So they do nothing, and doing nothing will come with a price, both for Americans who will lose their health insurance and for the politicians who allowed it to happen.

A proposal to cut the business enterprise tax from 0.55% to 0.5% is moving ahead to a vote by the full House in January, after the Ways and Means Committee voted along party lines Monday to recommend the bill to the full House. 
The bill, House Bill 155, would bring about the first business tax cut in three years. And it would come after Gov. Kelly Ayotte said in January that she was not interested in lowering the business enterprise tax in her budget. “Our budget proposal will be based on the revenue structure we have today,” Ayotte said then. 
Democrats strongly oppose the move, pointing to months of underwhelming revenues coming into the state. And the bill has reinvigorated a long-running debate between the two parties: whether cuts to business taxes have helped or hurt the state’s tax haul. 
And while Republicans retained the bill in the Ways and Means Committee amid uncertainty regarding the budget, Monday’s vote will propel the proposal to all 400 House members in January. Proponents of HB 155 say the legislation is necessary to allow companies in the state to grow, especially amid uncertainty.
The business enterprise tax imposes a levy on all compensation, dividends, and interest paid by a business in New Hampshire. It is different from the business profits tax, which applies to profits a business has made in a tax year. 
“We know that when we lower taxes, we allow businesses to keep more of their hard-earned money, which fuels investment, job creation, and innovation,” said Rep. Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican and the sponsor of HB 155, in remarks to the Ways and Means Committee in January. 
“Employees benefit from better wages and more job opportunities,” he added. “Local economies are invigorated and our tax base grows naturally, ensuring that the state has the resources it needs without burdening taxpayers.”
The proposed cut is supported by the New Hampshire chapter of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which has said it would provide relief to small and large corporations in the state, as well as the fiscally conservative group Americans for Prosperity.
“(This) would allow them to hopefully put a little bit of money back in their business’ pocket to keep up with hiring, to pay their employees a little bit more, to hopefully retain them and attract new ones, to buy new equipment and then invest back in their business,” said John Reynolds, the New Hampshire state director for the NFIB, speaking in the January hearing.
As originally written, the tax cut in HB 155 would have taken effect January 2026; an amendment recommended by the committee Monday would push that date to January 2027. That means the new rate would apply to businesses for the 2027 calendar year and would be paid April 2028.
A push to lower the BET could spark a political brawl over revenue and spending. Democrats say reducing the tax rate will result in lost revenue when the state can least afford it.
“The argument is basically that we can’t afford to give anything up anymore,” said Rep. Susan Almy, a Lebanon Democrat, in an interview. 
Three months into the 2026 state fiscal year, business tax revenues are 10.4% lower than expected and 8.8% lower than they were last year, according to a September snapshot from the Department of Administrative Services. That estimate does not separate business enterprise tax revenue from business profits tax revenue; a fuller picture will not come until after April 2026. 
Because of the way businesses file quarterly tax estimates to the state, September is a pivotal month to gauge the health of state business taxes before Tax Day in April. The next key month will be December. 
While the revenues from business taxes have lagged recently, they have generally increased since the tax cuts began in 2015. Republicans say that’s evidence that they have worked to spur growth and should be continued.
“Every time this committee or the body has cut taxes, revenues have eventually increased,” said Rep. Jordan Ulery, a Hudson Republican, during the committee meeting Monday. 
But Democrats say most of that growth has come as a result of national economic conditions, influenced by factors such as corporations’ repatriation of offshore funds after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and the stimulus measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Those national programs would have boosted business tax revenues no matter what the New Hampshire tax rates were, Democrats say; and if the rates had not been cut, the state would have seen more revenue, they argue. 
An analysis in April by the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute estimated that between 2016 and 2024 the state lost out on somewhere between $795 million and $1.17 billion of the revenue it might have collected without the tax cuts, depending on how cautious the projections. 
Republicans have dismissed that analysis, contending that it does not capture the positive climate the tax cuts ushered in, allowing businesses to expand or move to the state when they otherwise would not have.
But while the business profits tax can be affected by larger national trends, the business enterprise tax is fueled largely by salaries paid. Data from before 2015, when the tax cuts began, show BET revenues are closely correlated to the amount paid out to salaries in the state, said Phil Sletten, research director at NHFPI. When salaries rise, so does the BET revenue, he said. 
Meanwhile, data from after 2015 shows that each time the BET was cut, there was a corresponding drop in BET revenue, Sletten said. 
“Each of the instances in which the business enterprise tax rate has been reduced, the revenue trends for the business enterprise tax have broken from the trends of total compensation paid,” Sletten said. “In other words, revenues have gone down from what they would have been after each tax rate reduction.”
To Almy, the current underperforming revenues suggest that lawmakers should not tinker with the existing taxes. Almy has warned that the revenue problem could worsen if federal tariffs begin to hurt the profits of national corporations, which provide the bulk of New Hampshire’s business tax dollars. 
“It’s going to be a question of how much do the revenues go as the tariffs hit,” Almy said. “… People are already cutting back on major expenses — the middle income and the lower income people.”
And Almy said if lawmakers are seeking to provide relief to small businesses, they should do so by raising the lower threshold to exclude more of them and target the tax to larger businesses, rather than lowering the rate overall. That’s a principle that should apply to any tax relief she said. 
“There should be exemptions for people that are so poor that if we tax them, they’re going to go to the poor house and we’re going to have to pay for it,” she said. “Or businesses that are so poor that they’re going to go out of business and we’ll lose the business.”
Other Democrats said lowering the business taxes could lower the amount available for school funding, which could increase costs for local property-tax payers.
But Republicans say the shaky business returns are not an argument against lowering the tax rate. Rep. Mike Bordes, a Laconia Republican, said Monday that lowering the BET would inch it closer to a “sweet spot” where it would bring in revenue while encouraging business activity.
“When we bring it down more, I think you’re going to see increased revenues,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/taxcut-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-09 05:56:37.280082

Millstone, situated on a section of coastline in Waterford that extends into Long Island Sound, had been under construction for nearly a decade. Its first boiling-water reactor, Unit 1, came online in 1970. Unit 2 soon followed, a more advanced pressurized-water reactor designed by Combustion Engineering Inc. in Windsor.
The plant would add its third and final reactor, Unit 3, in 1986.
The intervening years, however, had brought about the infamous 1979 accident at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island — and with it, growing public anxiety over the safety of nuclear power. By the late 1990s, the number of new reactors being built in the U.S. had plummeted to zero.
Millstone Unit 1 was powered down in 1995, joining a wave of decommissioning for older nuclear power plants in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine.
Units 2 and 3 continued operating, however. In 2005 the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission renewed both licenses, allowing the reactors to continue operating until 2035 and 2045, respectively.
Virginia-based Dominion Energy, which owns the plant, sent several of its leaders to Connecticut last month to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Unit 2. They gathered with local and state leaders, along with hundreds of current and former employees, at what is now New England’s oldest and largest nuclear power plant. 
Connecticut Mirror reporters were later allowed inside to view a portion of the operation and observe round-the-clock staff.

Like most of the nuclear reactors still operating in the U.S., Millstone Units 2 and 3 are pressurized-water reactors that rely on steam to spin a turbine and generate electricity. Its operation relies on three separate networks of pipes to heat and cool water. (A boiling water reactor, by contrast, utilizes only two systems of pipes.)
The first, or primary system, is a closed loop that absorbs energy from nuclear fission within the reactor core, heating water to high temperatures but preventing it from boiling due to pressure within the pipes. The hot, pressurized water then passes through the second system, a steam generator, where water under less pressure is allowed to evaporate into steam to power the turbine. The third system, or cooling system, pumps colder water from outside the plant to condense the steam back into water that is then circulated back through the steam generator.
The advantages of maintaining the separate systems is that the water inside the primary and secondary loops never mixes, preventing the spread of radiation.
When both of Millstone’s reactors are operating at full capacity, they circulate 1.55 million gallons of water a minute through the plant’s cooling system which ends up depositing the water back into the Sound.

At any given time, a team of five operators oversee Unit 2’s nuclear and electrical systems from a control room lined with hundreds of knobs, switches, levers, digital monitors and other analog devices that are recording the plants’ myriad functions.
There are five teams assigned to each of Millstone’s two control rooms. They work in shifts to ensure the plant can operate 24 hours a day for up to a year and a half before refueling.
Operators must undergo an extensive 18-month training program overseen by the NRC that is specific to each control room. Even a crew member on Unit 2 would have to be re-trained in order to transfer to Unit 3.
Mike Watson, one of the shift managers at Unit 2, has been at the plant for more than 18 years. Like many of the roughly 800 Dominion employees at Millstone, Watson previously served on nuclear-powered ships in the U.S. Navy.
“I still learn things every day,” Waston said. “Comfort is a matter of perspective.”

Just down the hall from the room where Watson and his team work is the now-abandoned control room for Millstone’s first reactor, Unit 1. Most of the extensive control devices and monitors have been removed from the seafoam-green electrical paneling.
“We get asked a lot if we’re ever going open up Unit 1 again,” said Susan Adams, Millstone’s State Policy Director. “I think if anyone ever saw this, they’d know its not going to happen.” 
Millstone’s Units 2 and 3 have a peak output of 2,100 megawatts of electricity, enough to power roughly 2 million homes.

The reactors themselves are located within thick concrete containment structures that are separate from the buildings housing Millstone’s offices, control rooms and turbine generators. 
Spent nuclear fuel from Millstone’s reactors is stored on site within large cooling pools — and later moved to dry steel casks sealed within concrete vaults.
With the U.S. government’s plans for a long-term nuclear repository currently at a standstill, the spent fuel will remain at Millstone indefinitely. As of 2021, a total of 2,441 metric tons of spent uranium fuel was being stored at Millstone and the former site of the Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in Haddam, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.

A half-century after Millstone’s Unit 2 opened, the plant still produces roughly one-third of all electricity generated within Connecticut and the vast majority of the state’s carbon-free power.
For that reason, the plant’s future has been the source of great interest and speculation in Hartford.
In 2022, state lawmakers voted to lift the state’s moratorium on new nuclear facilities, opening the door for Dominion to look to Millstone as a location to deploy the next generation of smaller, modular reactors.
During the anniversary event last month, Gov. Ned Lamont floated an expansion of nuclear power at Millstone, saying, “I don’t know whether it’s fission or fusion, or mega or modular, but it’s going to be here.”
Dominion officials, however, have made clear they’re focusing their efforts around newer modular reactors near the company’s Virginia headquarters, as well as states with fully-regulated utility markets. In the meantime, the company’s plans for Millstone will involve seeking an extension of its current license from the NRC, allowing the plant to continue operating until 2065.
Bob Blue, Dominion’s president and chief executive officer, said the company is planning to invest over $1 billion in Millstone over the next decade as part of that effort. 
“We’re eager to have a long-term certainty to make the investments necessary to ensure that it provides even more value for a long time to come,” Blue said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1002_SR_MillstoneTour_150-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-09 05:56:37.280082

(Photo from Ohio House website.)The Ohio House plan to set up a cryptocurrency reserve is turning into something a bit different.
One recent amendment expanded the scope of potential investments to include more traditional assets like bonds or exchange traded funds.
That change also directs a share of the interest earned on mortgage insurance, the rainy-day fund and unclaimed funds to the effort, and scrubs “cryptocurrency” from the new fund’s name.
Another tweak, approved Tuesday, gives the officials tasked with overseeing the fund certain liability protections if those investments go south.
The idea gave state Rep. Ismael Mohamed, D-Columbus, pause during Tuesday’s hearing.
“Does that also apply to acts of negligence or mismanagement?” he asked. “I certainly understand that the goal of this amendment, but I wanted to make sure does it apply to that degree to actual acts of negligence or impropriety?”
The measure’s sponsor, state Rep. Steve Demetriou, R-Bainbridge Twp., said “I want to assume it does not,” and described the changes as a way to protect state employees operating in good faith from changes in the market.
“Those employees of that agency or office are not liable for fluctuations in the market,” he said, “and I think that’s what we’re trying to clarify with this amendment.”
Still Demetriou acknowledged he wasn’t completely sure and promised to follow up with Mohamed.
What does the proposal look like now?
As it was initially envisioned, the Ohio Strategic Cryptocurrency Reserve would have permitted the state Treasurer to invest up to 10% of the uncommitted money in Ohio’s general fund, rainy day fund, and lottery trust in digital assets.
Importantly, the bill was discretionary — the Treasurer wasn’t required to invest in any crypto at all. But if the Treasurer did decide to invest, the options were tightly restricted.
Only digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $750 billion were eligible. The only cryptocurrency that fits that bill is Bitcoin, with a market cap of $2.4 trillion as of Oct. 7.
The next closest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, comes in at about $538 billion.
In May, Zach Prouty from the State Treasurer’s office testified before the committee. He explained from the Treasurer’s perspective money falls in two buckets: active and interim.
The active money is like a checking account — liquid funds, available immediately. But interim money gets invested in securities, “maturing within one day or up to five years.”
Still, the entire pool of money is managed as a single fund, so the Treasurer’s investment strategy emphasizes “safety, liquidity and earnings.”
Essentially, the state needs reliable returns, turning over quickly enough that there’s always enough to cash to meet its needs.
Earning a bit of interest, Prouty said, is “icing on the cake.” In the last two fiscal years, the state’s investments generated $2 billion in interest.
Demetriou’s original proposal encouraged the Treasurer’s office to use a small portion of the funding at its disposal to chase even greater returns investing in crypto.
But at a committee hearing in March, he insisted the idea is to make “long term holds,” not for the Treasurer to try out day-trading.
For what it’s worth, a $100 investment in Bitcoin back then would be worth just shy of $150 today according to a calculator hosted by Bitbo.
That underlying idea of a small fund seeking greater investment gains is still there, but it’s scope is different.
The Treasurer can still invest in crypto, but any other exchange traded asset or commodity is on the table now as well.
Prouty explained the Treasurer’s office is somewhat indifferent about what money the state pours into the new fund, but that a consistent revenue stream would be best for growth.
“Carving off investment earnings from other large state funds would be a great way to ensure some consistent cash flow while not tying up dollars that are otherwise appropriated in the budget,” he told the committee.
Under an amendment approved in May, 5% of the interest from mortgage insurance and unclaimed funds as well as 10% of the interest from the rainy-day fund will go to the new Ohio Strategic Reserve Fund.

(Photo Courtesy of the Ohio History Connection.)NEWARK, Ohio — The Octagon Earthworks here speak to us from 2,000 years ago — and they speak to the fraught cultural moment in which we find ourselves.
In terms of importance, the archaeologist who’s studied the site as much as anyone else likens it to Mecca and Jerusalem. 
In 2023, it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, joining the Great Wall of China, the Great Pyramids in Egypt, and the Taj Mahal in India on the list of the world’s greatest cultural or natural places. 
Modern indigenes find in the declaration an affirmation that Native peoples in North America are descended not from primitive simpletons, but from accomplished astronomers, mathematicians, engineers, and thinkers.
However, even after the complex was named a World Heritage Site, wealthy Newark residents continued to golf on this vast lunar observatory. 
The club had earlier claimed that its use — as a private country club — was better than making it a public monument to an accomplished group of prehistoric people.
And then, after he resumed the presidency this year, President Donald Trump again pulled the United States out of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization — the agency that gave the Ohio sites their World Heritage designation. 
Trump accused UNESCO of supporting “woke, divisive cultural and social causes.” 
The World Heritage designation celebrates a surpassing achievement. And unlike so many other monuments from antiquity, there’s no evidence that kings bullied slaves or serfs or peasants into building them.
So it would seem that some enemies of “woke” aren’t just opposed to history that might make the dominant group look or feel bad. They seem to be against history that makes anybody else look good.
But regardless of where the builders came from, how they looked, or what they believed, they’re obviously worthy of study. 
Somehow, peace reigned among them for centuries. 
Somehow, people scattered across a vast expanse of tiny settlements shared common beliefs strong enough to get them to come and build on a grand scale. 
Somehow, those earthworks were built with geometric and astronomical precision that astound modern scientists.
Around the time Jesus was launching his ministry in Galilee, a powerful belief system took fire on this continent, burning brightest and taking physical form in the Ohio Valley. 
Whether it was ignited by one person or a group is unknown. 
But it was a grand expression of the human need to share. To be elaborately social and reach beyond the mortal sphere. To transcend the parochial and tiny and become part of eternity.
And then for some still-unknown reason, it all stopped.
Maybe it’s just hard for Ohioans who think of home as “flyover country” to believe that something so profound could have happened here. But surely we’d be smart to learn from what lies almost literally in our backyard.

Magnificent numbers
By any objective standard, the Octagon Earthworks are astounding. 
Walk the vast site or stand on any of the observation points and it’s obvious that they’re made by humans. The 20-acre Observatory Circle curves perfectly. The walls of the octagon are arrow-straight. 
Measurement shows the dimensions were no accident. 
The Observatory Circle is 1,054 feet in diameter. A square with 1,054-foot sides fits perfectly inside the 50-acre octagon. 
Those dimensions were identical to those at three other sites of the same period 60 miles to the south in the Scioto Valley. 
Other dimensions repeat at other sites. The axis of another circle-and-octagon structure built by the same culture — the High Bank Works — sits at a 90-degree angle to that in Newark.
Finding those and other marvels, 19th-century Europeans knew they’d stumbled onto something extraordinary. 
So much so that in 1848 the earthworks became the subject of the Smithsonian Institution’s first volume in its “Contributions to Knowledge” series.

But too many in the nascent field of archaeology were stunted by their racism. 
They didn’t know the purpose of the monumental works. But they “knew” that whatever it was, it was beyond the ability of native ancestors.
“When Europeans crossed the Appalachians and into the Ohio Valley, they’re dumbfounded by all this,” said Brad Lepper, an archaeologist who’s spent his career studying the Newark earthworks and those to the southwest in the Scioto Valley. 
By the 19th century, the better part of two millennia had passed, things had dramatically changed in this part of the world, and many Europeans used those facts as license to come to a self-serving conclusion.
“When they’re looking at the Native Americans who are living alongside (the earthworks), they’re living a very different life,” Lepper said. 
“Everything’s all grown up in trees. So it’s obviously ancient people who (built this) and so they think the (contemporary) Indians came in recently. There’s this Moundbuilder Myth that’s terribly racist. They say, ‘Oh, this must be an ancient civilization of white people; Phoenicians, lost tribes of Israel. They think savage Indians came in later and wiped them out. Sort of like the Roman Empire destroyed by Visigoths and Goths. There’s no basis for that. They just made stuff up to say, ‘Oh no. This couldn’t be Indians. Because if Indians did this, maybe they’re actually civilized and maybe we should respect them. 
“But no. We want the land.”
The myth had dire implications for 19th century Native peoples.
In the 1830s, “when the federal government began removing Indians from Ohio and other states and resettling them in what would become Oklahoma, the public was ready to believe that the Indians were not smart enough to have built these monumental structures throughout the lands they were being forced to leave,” Richard D. Shiels, a historian and former director of Ohio State’s Newark Earthworks Center, wrote in “The Fertile Earth and the Ordered Cosmos,” a 2023 collection of essays. 
A peaceful, cityless society
While later civilizations such as the Cahokia near modern St. Louis and the Aztecs in Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City) also built monumental structures, what happened in the Ohio Valley two millennia ago was quite different. 
The later works were built in cities that were part of highly centralized kingdoms.
Not only wasn’t there a Hopewell tribe, the name isn’t even indigenous. It was given to the culture in the 1890s by archaeologist Warren K. Moorehead after he found earthworks on land in Ross County that was owned by Mordecai Hopewell.
It might even be a stretch to regard the earthworks of the period as built by a single culture.
Archaeologists have found ceremonial items “that have been crafted from literally the ends of their world — conch shells from the Gulf of Mexico, copper and silver from southern Canada,” Lepper said. 
“Fossil shark teeth from the Atlantic Coast. Even obsidian — black volcanic glass — that we’ve chemically traced to Obsidian Cliff at Yellowstone National Park.” 
There’s no evidence of cities — and the kings and armies they imply — from that period. Just far-flung settlements that were too small even to be regarded as villages.
Lepper said it’s unlikely that all the groups even spoke the same language. But something strange was happening. 
There’s no known climatological or other natural event to explain it. But no graves from the time have yielded skeletons with bashed skulls or other marks of war. 
All those people, sparsely scattered across that vast territory, were on the same spiritual page and at peace. For centuries.
“There seems to be an unparalleled lack of conflict,” Lepper said. “We see (conflict) in earlier and later cultures. But the Hopewell period appears to be a period of immense peace.”

Meshing with the heavens
What was the basis of that peace? The earthworks offer clues.
Lepper believes the octagon complex at Newark is the culmination of centuries of work started 60 miles southwest, down the Hopewell Road in the Scioto and Little Miami valleys. 
One of the its builders’ celestial goals was re-discovered by academics who were trying to show there might not have been any.
In the 1970s Ray Hively, an astrophysicist, and Robert Horn, a philosopher, were showing students at Indiana’s Earlham College how easy it is to attribute mistaken astronomical meanings to ancient structures. 
They had shown how many of the solar alignments believed to be intentionally charted in England’s 5,000-year-old Stonehenge turned out just to be flukes.
“If you put Stonehenge on a roulette wheel and spin it a thousand times, 997 times there will be a solstice alignment, but it’s just chance,” Lepper said.
The scholars went to Newark to see if they could corroborate that principle. 
But as they analyzed the complex, they saw something that had a very low chance of being mere chance. 
Exactly zero of the gaps between the octagon’s walls matched up with a solstice alignment the way the massive Fort Ancient earthworks above the Little Miami River mark the longest and shortest days.
Hively and Horn found something else that turned out not to be happenstance. 
They eventually found more than a dozen alignments in which the octagon charts the 18.6-year trek the moon takes across the sky. 
Decades of study and wonder followed.
The various alignments of maximum and minimum lunar standstills captured in the Octagon Earthworks. (Diagrams courtesy of the Ohio History Connection.)
“The physical scale and precision of (the ancient Newark works) is a great accomplishment, but the fact that this structure simultaneously encodes geometrical and astronomical information is an astounding and highly motivating discovery for any society that makes it,” Hively wrote in the 2023 “Guide to the Ceremonial Hopewell Earthworks.” 
“Even today, modern physicists are motivated in a sense by the same kind of dual desire… the passion, in fact, to find a correspondence between mathematical symmetry and natural phenomena. That is a very powerful discovery, and I think we’re dealing with something like that here.”
Generational feat
It’s an understatement to say the ancients faced big challenges mapping what is known as the “lunar standstill.” 
Due to gravitation, the plane on which the moon orbits the Earth and the one on which the Earth orbits the sun fluctuate relative to one another in an 18.6-year cycle. 
Over that time, the full moon rises in maximum northern and southern parts of the eastern horizon, and sets at high and low points in the western sky before changing direction. 
That’s called a “maximum lunar standstill.”
On June 11, the Strawberry Moon marked the southernmost moonrise since 2006 — the most recent maximum lunar standstill. 
It’s called a standstill because as it changes direction, the moon seems stalled in one part of the sky for a long time.
As part of the cycle, the moon also rises and sets at minimum high and low points on the horizons before again changing direction and creating a “minimum lunar standstill.”
It would have required meticulous observation to notice those standstills. But before TV, movies and electricity, people were much more connected to the night sky and much more attuned to celestial phenomena. 
They weren’t just evening entertainment, they were used to explain the origins of Earth and life and the caprices of the gods.
It’s unclear what significance the moon held for people building the Hopewell structures. But there are indigenous traditions that it is a grandmother and others that it is a mother — both life-givers and nurturers.
Think what it would have taken to not just notice the lunar standstill, but to figure out the entire lunar cycle. You’d have to do that before you could even conceive of building.
First, it would take a long while to recognize the parameters of the moon’s long, slow, back-and-forth march across the sky. 
As anybody who lives in this part of the world knows, it’s a sky frequently obscured by clouds, so it’s often hard to see the moon at all.
Then to chart it, you’d have to watch the full cycle at least twice to corroborate your original hunch and to mark the waypoints. That’s at least 37.2 years — and likely much longer.
“You probably had to take 100 years of observations,” Lepper said. “It would require generations.”

Supercollider
Then you’d have to figure out how to design the thing. 
As with Pythagoras in Greece several hundred years earlier, somebody would have had to have insights into geometry as he or she tried to explain the cosmos. 
It might be hard for those of us who learned this stuff in school to grasp, but neither Pythagoras nor the builders of Ohio Valley earthworks were doing what we think of as “math,” Lepper said.
“These people were parallel” to Pythagoras, he said. “He doesn’t view himself as a mathematician. He views himself as a philosopher and he thought geometry was sort of like figuring out what was in the mind of God. It wasn’t just abstract geometry — this is the way God thinks. It’s nature. These people were on that parallel track. They’re seeing patterns. They’re seeing things that appear to be an outgrowth of nature. And they want to sort of recreate it and show the gods that they’ve figured it out.”
Lepper believes that the Octagon Earthworks in modern Newark were the crowning achievement of the Hopewell period, which seems to have ended between 300 and 400 A.D.
“I think all of this geometry is figured out in the Chillicothe area,” he said. “You have a circle and an octagon in Chillicothe… So we have people in Chillicothe with all this knowledge. Some singular genius pulls it all together, comes 60 miles north, near Flint Ridge, and builds the grand synthesis of Hopewell geometry, astronomy, religion, science — everything here — and puts it all together. It’s like a religious super-conducting supercollider.”

Pilgrimage
Not only are the Octagon Earthworks a masterpiece of design, they were engineered to last 2,000 years and longer. 
Enough people had to make long journeys afoot that using just sticks, hoes and picks, they could dig up and move 7 million cubic feet of earth one basket at a time and create giant, perfectly formed shapes.
It was no casual undertaking. 
“Reasonably, this could have been built in 40 years,” Lepper said, explaining that people would have come in the summer, and many of their trips likely were timed to coincide with the cycles of the moon. 
The builders may have chosen the site because earlier Indians used fire to clear the land near Raccoon Creek to better hunt deer and other animals attracted to the salt licks here. 
They give modern Licking County its name. Located as it is near the intersection of the creek and the Licking River, people could follow natural highways to get here.
Jim Williams of the Ohio History Connection wrote of the confounding sophistication of the enterprise.
“Imagine the vision and charisma of the leaders of this project to get all the people involved, select gifted astronomers, mathematicians, and engineers, and then orchestrate the building of this place without the benefit of email, snail mail, or microphones,” he wrote in, “The Fertile Earth and the Ordered Cosmos.”
After the complex was completed, Lepper said, tens of thousands likely showed up for the biggest occasions such as maximum lunar standstills. 
It was a way to meet, worship, socialize, and trade. It was probably also a way to find a spouse and bring fresh genes to an isolated family group.
Standing in one of the observation points, the walls are so low, long and hidden behind trees that it can be difficult to get a clear idea of the scope of the project. But imagine 20,000 ancient people in the Observatory Circle under the night sky and it becomes animated. 
It seems certain they played music, sang, and danced. Surely they wore ceremonial costumes signifying the sacred importance of the occasion.
Imagine what an experience that would be if you’d spent almost all your life cut off in a tiny forest hamlet hundreds of miles away, thousands of years in the past. 
Then you made the pilgrimage to this area, following in the steps of your grandparents’ grandparents. 
Big as they were, the March on Washington or Woodstock couldn’t begin to describe the depth of it.

“Gods-eye view”
Lepper said the earthworks were built on a horizontal scale because they were built to impress not humans, but a celestial observer.
“They don’t see the moon as a rock orbiting around the Earth,” he said. “The moon and the sun are powerful spiritual beings — gods, sort of, but maybe they didn’t think of it quite that way.” 
Of the low walls of the Octagon Earthworks, Lepper said, “It doesn’t go up. It goes off to the horizons practically. But in spite of being so huge, it’s really precise… Hively and Horn think they made (the Observatory Circle) perfect, because they want the moon to see that it’s perfect and that they figured out all the cycles so the moon will look down and bless it and say ‘Yes, you’ve figured it all out.'” 
Hively and Horn called it a “gods-eye view.”
Due to the lack of any surviving written record, it isn’t known why, of all places, central Ohio was the center of such profound belief.
“This is Mecca. This is Jerusalem,” Lepper said. “And we don’t know why it’s here as opposed to somewhere else because we don’t have a Koran or a Bible to tell us the history of what happened here… It’s like the rise of Christianity or Islam. There’s some Buddha or some Moses. There’s some transformative figure here in the Ohio Valley who changes everybody’s lives.”
And then sometime after about 300 A.D., it all stopped. 
Lepper said the reason is unknown, but it might have been like the Apollo space program. The original goal was to reach the moon. Once that was achieved (by an Ohioan from the old Shawnee town of Wapakoneta), energy and resources drifted elsewhere.
In a 2022 ruling saying the Ohio History Connection could take back control of the earthworks and banish the golfers, the Ohio Supreme Court declared the site a transcendent example of human genius.
“The Octagon Earthworks align with the 18.6-year cycle of the moon’s orbital path around the earth with unparalleled geometric precision at a scale that dwarfs the Great Pyramid of Giza,” the opinion said. 
“Of all known prehistoric earthworks in the world, they offer a unique example of human ingenuity and the perennial desire to understand the universe and its celestial bodies. The historical, archeological, and astronomical significance of the Octagon Earthworks is arguably equivalent to Stonehenge or Machu Picchu.” 
Slow appreciation
It’s a painful irony that what is likely the capstone of all Hopewell structures in Ohio long was one of the least studied. 
Lepper said that in the early, less scientific days of archaeology, researchers focused less on what the ancients were trying to say with the structures and more on plundering their artifacts.  
But for him, it’s been something of a boon. Going to work in 1988 at what is now the Ohio History Connection, Lepper has gotten to spend a career piecing together the fascinating story of a highly sophisticated group of prehistoric people.
He wasn’t the first American to appreciate the earthworks. 
In the 1880s, Newark residents voted to tax themselves to preserve the site and offer its use to the Ohio State Militia, now known as the Ohio National Guard. 
By 1908, the militia had outgrown it and passed control to the Newark Board of Trade.
Ownership of the land remained with the public, but in 1910 it was leased to a private country club to which every member of the Board of Trade belonged, Lepper said. 
They ignored public calls to use the land as a park.
Those calls give the lie to claims that the country club somehow saved the earthworks, Lepper said.
“They saved them from becoming a public park,” he said.
Ownership of the land passed to what is now the History Connection in 1933 and over the following decades support grew among the public and interested professionals to open the site to the public, allow unfettered research and preserve it as a park. 
Even so, in 1997, the leadership of the History Connection agreed to extend the country club’s lease for generations, all the way to 2078.
Lepper said it was a serious misreading of public sentiment.
“I don’t think they had a clue that some people in the community were so angry about it,” he said. 
“When people found out about this lease extension, our director thought it was business as usual. But things had changed. They were blindsided by the reaction from Native Americans, archaeologists, historians — all kinds of people who should be our allies — but now were mad at us.”

Ancient ancestors?
Glenna Wallace knows something about that anger. 
After becoming chief of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma in 2006, she attended a lecture at Ohio State in 2007.
As Wallace prepared to take the top post in the tribe, she worked to overcome something that non-dominant groups commonly face — a lack of ready access to its history.
Shawnees were forced from Ohio and surrounding states to Oklahoma in the 1830s as part of the broader Trail of Tears. Preserving tribal history took a back seat to more pressing needs, Wallace said.
“The emphasis was not on keeping records,” she said. “The emphasis was not on having meetings and writing minutes. The emphasis was on staying alive. My tribe knew very little or anything about our history.”
Wallace said she spent years learning all she could. An important element of that history is that even though the Shawnees moved about over the last 300 years, the tribe has deep roots in the Ohio Valley.
“Ohio was our homeland,” Wallace said. 
It may be impossible now to say for sure whether the Shawnees directly descended from the people who built the Hopewell structures. But it’s possible. 
Lepper said there’s an oral tradition involving Simon Kenton, who fought the Shawnees in the late 1700s. 
According to it, Kenton said Shawnees would stop at Fort Ancient to pay homage to its builders — who even then were ancient — whenever the Indians were in the area.
“They recognized it as a sacred place,” Lepper said.
For Wallace, it’s a connection. 
“We are a small tribe,” she said. “We got down to only 63, we didn’t know our history, people just tried to exist.”
Then she went out to see the Octagon Earthworks during her 2007 visit to Ohio State.
“I knew that what I was seeing was equal to — if  not superior to — the Great Wall of China, or the Pyramids in Egypt, or Machu Picchu in Peru,” Wallace said. “The amount of effort, the amount of work, the amount of dedication, the sophistication… It was unbelievable. It was life-changing.”
Yet she also saw the activity that greatly restricted research at the site — and throttled how many school kids and others could visit. 
Members of a private club were driving carts along and taking divots out of those ancient walls as they golfed, perhaps obliviously, away.
“I could not understand why there was a golf course on top of this beautiful, sacred place,” Wallace said. “I walked away saying the biblical verse, ‘Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.'”

Striving for global recognition
Wallace joined the effort, already underway, to have the Octagon and other Hopewell-era earthworks declared a World Heritage Site. 
But the Ohio History Connection had to contend with country club lessees who somehow were granted an 81-year extension back in 1997. 
In 2018, the History Connection offered to buy out the lease for $800,000. The country club didn’t respond.
The country club later argued to the courts that it was unlikely that the Octagon Earthworks would gain a World Heritage inscription. 
It argued that researchers and the public already were allowed to see the place when the club saw fit to let them. 
And it argued that maintaining it as a private golf course was a higher, better use than what the History Connection and its allies had in mind — turning it into a public park and seeking global recognition as one of the most important cultural sites in the country.
In court, the Moundbuilders Country Club argued “that a governmental entity can establish that (eminent domain) is necessary for a public use only if it shows that its proposed use of the property would provide more of a benefit to the public than the current private use,” the Ohio Supreme Court wrote in 2022. 
It was part of a ruling in which the court disagreed and allowed the History Connection to invoke eminent domain.

By last year, the History Connection and the country club agreed to an undisclosed sum for the lease. 
With no apparent irony, the owner of the land where the country club planned to move said the country club “got shoved out of their land,” the New York Times reported.
But before that, in September 2023, a team that included Lepper and Wallace traveled to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 
There they received a global verdict on the Octagon Earthworks that was starkly at odds with the claims of the private club that didn’t want to leave the site.
It took just minutes for the UNESCO panel to declare that the works passed its highly selective muster. 
That made them and other Hopewell earthworks the only World Heritage Site in Ohio, one of just 26 in the United States, and of 1,248 in the world. 
Redemption
On July 24, the World Heritage status seemed poised to deliver on its promises of increased tourism. 
The old clubhouse was still in the process of being converted to a visitor center. Asphalt cart paths and remnants of sand traps were still visible in the earthworks, where trees still obscured many views. Temperatures exceeded 90 degrees. The humidity was brutal. 
Yet more than a dozen visitors — most seeming in late middle age — were in the center and more were outside.
The benefits may grow exponentially.
For example, Mount Sanqingshan National Park in China made the World Heritage list in 2008. The number of visitors there grew from 1.48 million that year to 23.95 million in 2019 — a sixteen-fold increase, researchers reported in 2023. 
But on July 22, the Trump administration announced that it was pulling out of the organization that named the Newark site to the global list. It said it was over its “woke” views and a supposed anti-Israel bias.

Yet while Israel undeniably has a lot of history, it has less than 1% of the population of the United States and less than 1% of its area. 
Even so, supposedly anti-Israel UNESCO has granted nine Israeli sites World Heritage status — nearly 35% as many as the vastly larger, more-powerful United States.
For Wallace, the Shawnee chief, UNESCO’s inscription of the Hopewell earthworks as a World Heritage Site means redemption. 
She grew up not knowing her history amid a popular tradition that Indians were primitive, were savages.
“It’s a testament to our ancestors,” she said. “At last, they can be recognized. Not as savages, but as geniuses. Uncommon geniuses.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once said that as long as poverty existed, he could never be rich, even with a billion dollars.
“As long as diseases are rampant and millions of people in this world cannot expect to live more than 28 or 30 years, I can never be totally healthy even if I just got a good checkup at Mayo Clinic,” he said. “I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be.”
King saw stunning inequality some 60 years ago and proposed structural changes to help make the country whole. These ideas — the death of inequality and the survival of a common good — could determine society’s future.
Some 27,000 Kansans lost Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program access after passage earlier this summer of President Donald Trump’s H.R. 1 bill that shifted millions in federal responsibilities to states.
This vast new wave of food insecurity could create another social pathogen.
Back in 2016, a Clemson University researcher offered “An Examination of Food Insecurity and Its Impact on Violent Crime in American Communities.” The study, by Jonathan Randel Caughron, “examines how the relationship between food insecurity and violent crime varies in relation to the level of dependent variables such as the income level and population level of the county.”
The study suggested a 1% increase in food insecurity could lead to a 12% increase in violent crime.
Mean policy — cutting access to food and education — seems to produce mean people. We are more connected than many care to admit, no matter how many walls and gated communities we build. We fixate on symptoms but avoid causes.
This nation remains proficient at tough and even cruel anti-crime measures. Consider what this portends, especially as inequality continues to rise. According to an Associated Press article from 2019, U.S. inequality had grown to its highest level in a half-century. Yes, it said, “even in Kansas.”
“The gap between the haves and have-nots in the United States grew last year to its highest level in more than 50 years of tracking income inequality, according to U.S. Census Bureau,” the article said.
It went on: “Income inequality in the United States expanded from 2017 to 2018, with several heartland states (like Kansas and Nebraska) among the leaders of the increase, even though several wealthy coastal states still had the most inequality overall.” 
The report noted that not only had Kansas opted to not raise the minimum wage, but the economic recovery also led to windfalls for those owning “stocks, property, and other assets.” 
The article referenced University of Kansas economist Donna Ginther, who said: “The winners tend to be at the top. Even though we are at full employment, wages really haven’t gone up much in the recovery.” 
There remains a school of thought that poverty reflects bad choices and bad character. Even King reportedly exhorted Black Americans to prepare themselves for full citizenship by getting their financial houses in order. 
But he also said: “The curse of poverty has no justification in our age. The time has come for us to civilize ourselves by the total, direct, and immediate abolition of poverty.” 
King spoke often of the systems that support a culture of poverty.
“True compassion,” he said, “is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it is not haphazard and superficial. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.”
And: “One day we must ask the question, ‘Why are there 40 million poor people in America?’ And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth.” 
Extremists frequently quote King out of context about “content of character,” and “color of skin,” but they never acknowledge his commitment to the poor, a belief system that likely got King killed. 
King objected to the war in Vietnam, arguing that military spending drained resources for “social uplift” programs. 
“The bombs in Vietnam explode at home; they destroy the hopes and possibilities for a decent America,” he said. 
King wasn’t alone. President Dwight Eisenhower expressed similar thoughts.
“Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and not clothed,” he said. “This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.” 
Ike sounds like King there. The question becomes just how this “Christian” nation will respond. What does this mean for wealthy Christians seemingly choosing a third or fourth house and a fourth or fifth car over food and shelter for suffering people? 
H.R. 1, also called the “big, beautiful bill,” represented to many observers the greatest transfer of wealth from the poor and working class to the wealthy in the nation’s history. But people are not disposable, and we are not meant to live in isolation. 
“This is the way our world is made,” King said. “No individual or nation can stand out boasting of being independent. We are interdependent.”

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)The future of community solar is dimming, hampered by federal attacks on clean energy and shifts in state markets.
Installations of the shared-solar approach took a nosedive in the first half of 2025, dropping by 36% from the same period last year, according to a new report by consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Working in collaboration with the Coalition for Community Solar Access, an industry trade group, Wood Mackenzie forecasts that by the end of 2025, installations will fall by 29% from 2024’s record high of 1.7 gigawatts. According to the analysis, growth will likely contract by an average of about 12% annually through 2030.
“I’m dismayed by this report,” said John Farrell, co-director of the research and advocacy nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance. ​“Of the places where we have policies [that drive community solar], it looks like things are slowing down.”
Why community solar is buckling despite its benefits
Community solar makes clean power accessible to those who can’t put solar panels on their roofs — be it because they rent, can’t afford them, or have other reasons. Households can subscribe to a share of an off-site array, which is typically 2 to 20 megawatts, per the report, to get credit for the power and save on their energy bills. Third-party developers usually build and own these installations — not utilities.
About 9.1 gigawatts of shared solar have been installed in the U.S. to date, according to the report’s authors. They expect community solar capacity to reach roughly 16 GWby 2030.
The megabill that Republicans passed in July is a major reason for the community solar market’s shake-up. The law set an early expiration date for a key tax credit worth 30% to 50% of the cost of a project. Developers once had until 2034 to claim it; now companies must either start construction by July 2026 and finish within four years or start producing power by the end of 2027.
Because of the law’s passage, Wood Mackenzie slashed its community solar figures through 2030 by about 8%, or 655 megawatts, from its prior forecast, said Caitlin Connelly, senior analyst at the firm and lead author of the report.
But factors at the state level are also contributing to the slowdown. In particular, New York and Maine are driving the steep decline.
Developers in New York, a mature market, are having trouble finding sites, paying higher permitting and land costs, and having to wait an average of nearly three years to get connected to the grid, making projects more expensive to develop, Connelly said.
Meanwhile, in Maine, two regulatory changes are at play. Last year saw record growth as developers sprinted to get projects done by the December phaseout of the state’s net metering program, leading to fewer in the pipeline now, Connelly noted. In June, legislators also passed a bill that retroactively overhauled compensation for community solar power and added fees for new and established projects. The industry has said these provisions will make the state a ​“pariah for investors.”
Some states, such as Virginia and New Mexico, also have caps on the size of their community solar programs that are limiting new developments, according to Connelly.
And more federal turbulence could be ahead.
The Trump administration is also trying to claw back funding that would’ve supported solar: the $7 billion Solar for All program and the $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, programs passed under the landmark Inflation Reduction Act.
“The impact of [losing] Solar for All is one that we are tracking closely,” Connelly said, as the move could stymie community solar in places where it’s just getting off the ground.
While this year is likely to be a rough one for community solar, Connelly sees growth returning in 2026 and 2027. This is in part due to rebounds in Massachusetts and New Jersey, both of which are transitioning into new iterations of existing programs.
Public advocate praises new net energy billing reform law that could save ratepayers money

Massachusetts will open up its Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program, SMART3.0, to developers on October 15. And New Jersey recently eliminated a 150-megawatt annual cap and unlocked a whopping 3 gigawatts of community solar capacity.
But that growth is just a temporary reprieve. Over the longer term, the forecast shows community solar installations trending down.
How to revive community solar growth
A few factors could change the sector’s fortunes, however.
For one, if states were to start new community solar programs, as well as address interconnection bottlenecks, they could drive up to 1.3 gigawatts of additional capacity through 2030, according to the report. But ​“we don’t really see any new programs opening up, at least in the near term,” Connelly said. ​“Policymakers have made a lot of progress in some state markets over the last six months to a year, but the difficulty is getting that legislation over the finish line.”
In deep red Montana, for example, legislators approved a new community solar program, with 100 in favor and 50 opposed, underscoring the model’s growing appeal to Republicans. But Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) vetoed the bill, claiming that it could result in ​“unreasonable costs” being foisted on other energy customers.
Only 24 states plus Washington, D.C., have passed community solar legislation as of February, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Iowa are all considering shared-solar bills, said Jeff Cramer, president and CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access.
Other states could be tempted to authorize a flood of clean, cheap solar power. The grid is facing soaring demand from data centers, electric vehicles, buildings, and manufacturing, and distributed community solar is among the fastest options to deploy.
“If you want to build a new gas plant right now, you’re going to need five-plus years minimum to do it. You want to build a new utility-scale [solar or wind] facility — at least five years as well, and that’s pending the development of new transmission,” Cramer said.
By contrast, community solar has a typical development timeline of six months to two years, he added. ​“The only kind of capacity that we can build close to load and faster than those timelines to meet load growth and grid congestion is distributed solar.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DSC_0370-scaled-e1696034646170-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-09 04:57:16.926382

(Via Visit Florida)I am such a big booster of Florida and its features! I am constantly telling people about the many ways in which we beat the rest of the nation.
We have the best state park system, one that’s won national awards four times! Our beaches are often ranked the best in the country! And I recently heard that we have the most polluted lake in the nation!
Wait. That one’s not so great, is it?
“Lake Okeechobee is known as the largest freshwater lake in the state of Florida, but a new study also ranks it as the dirtiest lake in the country,” WPBF-TV reported last month.
The finding came from an unlikely source: a website called “Lake.com,” which promotes vacation rentals on or near the water.
But these folks did their homework. They evaluated the 100 largest lakes in the nation using chemical data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Water Quality Monitoring Council from January 2020 to July 2025.  
Lake O, often called “the liquid heart of Florida,” had high levels of lead contamination, turbidity, and elevated phosphorus levels — “a combination that contributes to murky appearance and potentially stimulates algae growth.”
Sounds like our liquid heart is having some serious heart trouble, doesn’t it?
The South Florida Water Management District, which shares responsibility for operating Lake O (more on that in a minute), contended to WPBF that the figures used in the survey were misleading.
At first, I was willing to give the agency known as “Softmud” the benefit of the doubt. This wouldn’t be the first time some random website conjured up a controversial listicle just to make people argue about it, coming up with clickbait like “The Five Most Frightening Stephen King Books and Four That Totally Suck.”
But when I checked this out with those in the know, they told me the bad rating was dead-on.

Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch via SFWMD
“It’s not surprising to me or to anyone else that this ranks as the worst lake in North America,” said Gary Roderick, former southeast bureau chief for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.
The lake’s water quality has undergone such a long, slow slide, several people told me, that some folks may not have noticed how awful it’s become. 
But the lake has earned its place at No. 1.
“It is no surprise that Lake Okeechobee has been named the dirtiest lake in the nation,’ a disgrace that could have been averted as the writing has been on the wall for many decades,” former SFWMD member Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch told me.
Eve Samples via Friends of the Everglades
She and Eve Samples of Friends of the Everglades both pointed a finger at the state’s failure to protect the lake from well-connected polluters.
“Without teeth in our cleanup laws,” Samples said, “this ‘dirtiest lake”’ designation is something we’ll have to put up with until we finally get Lake Okeechobee cleaned up.”
A slow-motion cyclone
Lake Okeechobee means “big water” in the Seminole language. The water district calls that “an appropriate name for a water body whose opposite shore can’t be seen from the water’s edge.”
At 730 square miles, it is the largest lake in the southeastern U.S. and the second largest in the nation located within a single state. But it’s fairly shallow, with an average depth of just 9 feet.
Yet that shallow water has been deadlier than any Stephen King villain. In 1928 a hurricane hit South Florida and turned Okeechobee into what Florida novelist Zora Neale Hurston called a “monstropolous beast” that walked the earth “with a heavy heel.”  Hundreds or possibly thousands of people living by the lake drowned.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built an earthen dike named for Herbert Hoover around the lake to prevent that from happening again.
The same agency straightened out all the bends in the Kissimmee River, ending its seasonal flooding of pastures and farm fields.
As a result, the gentle river flowing into the lake became a ditch that funneled pollution straight into it. (The Corps, to its credit, has more recently put the bends back.)
Meanwhile, the dike and a new road called  the Tamiami Trail blocked water from its normal path south into the Everglades. Instead, Lake Okeechobee — jointly run by the Corps and the water district — began functioning as both a water supply source for the towns and a disposal basin for the sugar companies flushing excess fertilizers from their fields.
As an added contaminant, state agencies have routinely dosed aquatic plants on the lake with powerful herbicides. Think of it as flavoring!
Swallow tail kite via UF
Don’t get me wrong. The lake has long been a wonderful place for seeing wildlife. One of the greatest mornings of my life came the day when I saw roughly 1,000 migrating swallow tail kites lifting off from some pines at the lake’s edge, circling like a slow-motion cyclone.
Hiking and bicycling fans love the 110-mile Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail — LOST for short — which circles “the Big O” atop the 35-foot dike. And bass anglers have long bragged about their take from the lake.
But the state of Lake O has gotten worse and worse because of the rampant pollution, and even the wildlife began showing the effects.
Newton Earl Cook via United Waterfowlers of Florida
As Newton Earl Cook from United Waterfowlers of Florida pointed out last week in an op-ed in the Palm Beach Post: “The situation seemed dire two years ago when Bass Masters removed Lake Okeechobee from its Top Ten Bass Lakes in the United States.”
Algae season
The problems of Lake Okeechobee go beyond the lake. That’s because of the life-saving dike.
If the water in the lake gets too high, the ancient embankment could crack. Water could pour out, drowning the towns nearby like it’s 1928 all over again.
When the water level approaches a possible breach, the Corps flushes a lot of the water out. They dump it into a pair of waterways that send it shooting out to Fort Myers on one side of the state and Stuart on the other.
Nothing good happens when they do that. And it keeps on happening.
“Toxic algae bloom crisis hits Florida, drives away tourists,” was the headline on a story I wrote in 2016. The Corps’ release of water from the lake had spread its toxic blooms to both coasts, ruining the tourist economy of both.
“This economic and environmental disaster was cooked up in the stew pot that is Lake Okeechobee, where state officials have not required pollution limits to be met since those limits were created in 2001,” I wrote nine years ago.
This repulsive mess got even worse in 2018. Toxic algae blooms had become so widespread that it became known as “the Summer of Slime.”  
Rick Scott, then the governor, was running for the U.S. Senate. People who blamed him for allowing the increased pollution fueling the algae blooms booed him so thoroughly at one campaign appearance that he fled. For years afterward, he’s been known as “Red Tide Rick.”
This was the year an obscure congressman named Ron DeSantis first ran for governor. He vowed to fix the algae bloom problem. After he took office, he appointed a panel of actual scientists to recommend ways to get rid of the algae blooms. They did.
Then he and the Legislature ignored nearly all of their recommendations,
Instead, they passed the irresponsible but ironically named “Clean Waterways Act,” full of voluntary measures, not mandatory ones.
Imagine if we used a similar approach to homicide.
“Murder is definitely NOT okay, people,” we’d tell everyone. “Not cool! Please don’t do it! But if you slip up and blow someone away, hey, don’t worry. Nobody will punish you for it.”
Considering how much these toxic algae blooms affect people’s health, that’s pretty much what’s happening with our lack of limits on pollution.
Guess what’s happening in Lake O right now. “Florida Department of Health issues blue-green algae alert for Lake Okeechobee,” WPBF-TV reported last week.
“This is algae season in Florida,” Friends of the Everglades’ Samples said. “That’s now an annual problem.”
Just like the Blob
The good news is that, so far in 2025, we haven’t experienced any hurricanes dumping big buckets of rain on Florida.
As a result, the Corps hasn’t needed to drain Lake Okeechobee to the coasts, which means those areas have been spared any toxic algae blooms.
But when it comes to cleaning up the lake itself, well, the good news is in short supply.
“Primarily agriculture and developments’ brazen, dominant monetary influence on generations of most state politicians has gotten us here,” Thurlow-Lippisch of the water management district told me.
Instead of clamping down on polluters, the DEP has set up a series of “basin management action plans” that just plain don’t work.
“Rainfall runoff that flows into Lake O from hundreds of surrounding properties routinely exceeds the [pollution] limit — without the state imposing any consequences,” TCPalm.com reported in 2022. “All 32 drainage basins around the lake with available data exceeded the limit over a five-year average.”
The continuing degradation of the lake is “a reflection of the flawed BMAP [Basin Management Action Plan] process,” Samples told me.
Julie Wraithmell via Audubon Florida
What would help the lake is if the state were to pay ranchers and other landowners north of the lake to restore the complex chain of wetlands that once filtered out pollution, said Julie Wraithmell, executive director of Audubon Florida.
Ideally, she said, the southward flow through the wetlands toward the lake would proceed  like playing a giant version of the plinko board on “The Price Is Right.” By the time the water reaches its destination, it will have been cleaned naturally.
“The Everglades is not going to be fully restored until we fully restore Lake Okeechobee to its former glory,” Wraithmell said.
Instead of turning to natural cleanup methods, the government has turned to artificial means.
Ribbon-cutting for the C-43 reservoir via SFWMD.
The latest component of the $20 billion Everglades rescue, into which the state and feds have invested millions of tax dollars, is a 10,000-acre reservoir called the C-43 that just opened this summer, said Joe Cavanaugh of the Calusa Waterkeeper.
The reservoir is supposed to hold excess runoff as well as water released from the lake, so it won’t have to go straight to the estuaries near Fort Myers.
Newton Earl Cook via United Waterfowlers of Florida
But that still doesn’t solve the lake’s continuing problem with what Cavanaugh called “the legacy pollution” that flowed into it unchecked for decades, fueling those algae blooms.
But fear not, my fellow Floridians! I have a plan for dealing with that.
The Legislature has begun holding committee meetings to discuss the priorities for the next session. We’re also nearing the popular Halloween holiday.
Those two events make this the perfect time to strike.
Everyone who’s tired of seeing Lake O being turned into a toilet, let’s all gather along the dike in the dead of night on All Hallow’s Eve. We can all join hands and chant an ancient incantation.
Then, slowly, ever so slowly, a new monstropolous beast will rise up — a toxic green mass of algae full of malevolent energy, like “The Blob” from the 1950s.
We will point it toward Tallahassee and tell it, “Go get’ em!

This is what matters most to me in this race.,"Dear Wallingford,
Love  of our hometown is what  is  driving  me  to run for  a seat on your Town Council. 
And as I’ve been out and about connecting with residents, everyone is seeking civility in our politics and pragmatic local candidates of integrity, who  will put in the hard work and bring the skills to get the job done.   

Bryan Rivard
I’ll work tirelessly to bring people together, regardless of political affiliation or ideology, to find common ground that benefits all residents, businesses and  families of Wallingford.  I represent everyone in our community, and I want each  of you  to know that my door is always open. We can’t build the best community possible unless all voices are heard and sincerely respected.  This is what matters most to me in this race. 
Another   issue I hear a lot about is the need for better town-wide planning practices, especially for the long-term.  While it won’t garner flashy headlines, I agree with voters that the subject is critically important to ensure we align on shared goals and make steady progress toward them, while keeping an eye on the overall cost. Some have expressed worry that our town’s historical decision-making favors near-term cost minimization without regard for down-stream impacts; a reactive mode that pushes off maintenance of assets, further snowplows and piles up higher costs down-stream, resulting in need for major repairs and/or replacements. These often come at unexpected times and displace other smart investments for the future…and so-on goes the cycle. 
Such a broad generalization may not be totally fair or accurate, but there is often some truth in criticism, and I’d challenge the next Town Council to collaborate with the next mayor’s administration, board of ed, town departments and other stakeholders to view it as an opportunity to grow their practices and strike a better, more proactive balance.  It will take time, effort and perhaps changes in process, but the pay-off can be more efficient operations, less hidden and unanticipated costs and a methodical approach to returning our schools, infrastructure, shared spaces and other assets to a high standard that we can all be proud of.  And if you entrust me with a seat on your Town Council, I’ll remain laser-focused on helping all to address this concern and I’d  bring many years of directly applicable experience and skills that uniquely position me to hit the ground running. 
For those who I haven’t had a chance yet to meet around town, here is a bit more about my background. I am a director of commercial jet engine programs at Pratt & Whitney and have been a loyal employee there for over 20 years.  I maintain a Project Management Professional (PMP) Certification, hold a BS in Engineering from Cornell, MS from Rensselaer and an MBA from Carnegie Mellon, which have all prepared me for success in my career and  helped develop useful and unique skills for this role in local government.   
I have learned how to meet challenging and global business goals with integrity.  Every day, I must listen to many voices and interpret various sources of data to inform best solutions and make good decisions.  I enjoy building creative, self-motivated and collaborative teams that focus on results and get the job done.  And having full accountability for many large programs, I must work with fiscal responsibility, demonstrating smart budgeting and cost control, with an eye to pursuing prudent growth measures. 
In our community, I enjoy volunteering  on the board for the Meriden-Wallingford United Way, and on the Planning and Zoning Commission, where I’ve advocated to carefully consider affordable housing options, including “middle housing,” while ensuring neighborhood character is maintained.  Market conditions are making down-sizing options for seniors challenging and many other residents who contribute positively to our town are struggling to find something that works for their financial and life situation.   
As a  past chairperson of the School-District Wide Parent Teacher Advisory Council (PTAC) and in past board of education runs, I’ve been a strong advocate for our students and schools, and I’ve highlighted the importance of transparently connecting investment to the kind of long-term planning I described above.   
I’ve been a past STEM-town steering committee member, involved on various interview panels for town positions, a mentor for college and career pathways, a Scout Troop leader, a coach for little league and soccer and our family is active in our church St. Benedict of Nursia.  This October, my incredible wife Anne Marie and I are celebrating 20 years of marriage and my greatest pride comes from being a dad to three amazing kids…our twin daughters Jocelyn and Bridget who are high-school sophomores and Owen who just started kindergarten. 
Serving our incredible Wallingford community in any capacity has been a joy and privilege for nearly 20 years. It would be an honor to elevate that service to the Town Council. If entrusted with a seat, I’ll work diligently to help build Wallingford’s best future.  
I promise to carefully consider each decision with the best interests of all our town residents at heart. I thank you in advance for your support and I humbly ask for your vote on November 4!  Please feel free to connect or reach out!

Ford,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/10/08/early-child-education-focus-of-all-day-symposium/,"Chris Peusch hopes it's a sign that early childhood is getting recognition it deserves: As many as eight state lawmakers may attend Maryland State Child Care Association annual symposium Thursday, more than she can remember at the decades-old event.","Lucas Elbery, 4, left, and Toluwanimi Oluremi, 3, pick tomatoes Sept. 12 at Arco Iris Bilingual Children’s Center in Laurel as Thiago Escobar, 2, sits nearby. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Chris Peusch hopes it’s a sign that early childhood care is starting to get the recognition she thinks it deserves.
Peusch, the executive director of the Maryland State Child Care Association, said that eight Democratic state lawmakers have said they may show up for the association’s annual leadership symposium Thursday, more than she can remember for an event that’s been going on for at least 30 years.
Next year is an election year for all 188 state legislators, but Peusch hopes it’s more than that.
“I understand the politics, but hopefully they find it to be valuable or they wouldn’t show up,” Peusch said Wednesday. “Early childhood education [and] child care impacts children, families, the economy, businesses. It impacts everyone.”
The symposium in Columbia is mainly geared toward child care owners, operators and administrators to provide them updates on early childhood policies, workplace practices and other information.
The morning session will include a panel featuring a number of legislators titled, “How Do We Inspire Workforce and Business Growth in Child Care Early Childhood?”
Participants are expected to include Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City), who serves on the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee, and Dels. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), recognized as one of the legislative leaders on early childhood, and Julie Palakovich Carr (D-Montgomery), who chairs the Ways and Means Committee’s early childhood subcommittee.
Other possible attendees include Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard), who chairs the Ways and Means Committee, and Del Jessica Feldmark (D-Howard and Anne Arundel), who sits on the committee. The two also happen to be running for Howard County executive.
One topic that may be discussed is House Bill 1475, for which Feldmark was the lead sponsor in the 2025 General Assembly. The law established a 12-member prekindergarten system analysis work group that is tasked with assessing the state’s mixed-delivery system on full-day prekindergarten that’s part of the multibillion-dollar Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
Del. Greg Wims (D-Montgomery) was appointed by House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) to the work group, which held its first meeting last month and is set to hold the second virtually Oct. 16..

Wims, who will participate in the symposium for the first time, said Wednesday he wants to hear from providers on how much the enrollment freeze in the child care scholarships are affecting them. The state Department of Education stopped taking applications in May, after enrollment threatened to bust the program budge, and hoped to reopen applications for new families last month, but enrollment remains frozen.
“The first thing is to listen to these business owners having trouble with the funds being froze,” Wims said Wednesday. “The economic engine in the state of Maryland starts with child care. If you’re home and cannot work, you can’t provide and pay bills.”
Those child care providers will have afternoon sessions with panels including wellness strategies for early childhood professionals, connecting families with community resources and managing workplace dynamics.
Peusch will also provide attendees with legislative updates, including a renewed push in the 2026 General Assembly for a tax on sugary drinks, a proposal that failed to even get a committee vote in Ways and Means during the 2025 session.
That bill would have added a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sugary drinks, syrups and powders. It would have dedicated up to $189 million for health school lunches and another $50 million toward the child care scholarship program. While it failed in Maryland, other state legislatures, such as New York and Nebraska, looked into similar measures.
Peusch is hopeful for 2026, despite the bill’s failure in 2025.
“What we are able to accomplish this year, I don’t know, but we have to come up with some creative and innovative ways to bring funding and to sustain it,” Peusch said. “The sugary tax is more sustainable. It’s not like waiting for the governor’s budget. Some of that money will be earmarked. Other states are looking at it and we have to also do that.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Arco-Iris-child-care-center-tomato-plant-9-12-2025-cropped-e1759981430164-1024x752.jpg,,,2025-10-08 23:56:31.228776

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A new study published by the Belfer Center of the Harvard Kennedy School has concluded that solar power plants are now cost-competitive with diesel for many rural Alaska communities, even if solar is only usable during part of the year. 
“The conclusion was that they were pretty darn competitive,” said Henry Lee, the study’s co-author and director of the Environment and Natural Resources Program. He performed the analysis with public policy graduate student Windy Dewi, the other co-author.
“Solar actually can give you cheaper electricity and will pay for itself over time under a lot of assumptions regarding oil prices,” he said.
“Now, would you be able to go 100% on solar? Not at all. You will always need diesel, particularly in the months where there’s no sun, and you also need it during the night and things like that,” Lee said.
But even taking into account the costs of building and maintaining both a solar power plant and a diesel one simultaneously, the hybrid model is frequently cheaper or equal to diesel alone, the study found.
Solar prices have fallen in recent years as panels become more efficient, while diesel prices have been erratic but generally on the rise. Continued improvements in battery and solar technology are expected to intensify the economic edge. 
The study was based on information from the Northwest Arctic Borough, but Lee said he believes its findings are relevant for other parts of rural Alaska where diesel fuel prices are high.
“If the annualized capital cost of the renewable generator, measured in cents per (kilowatt-hour), is less than the cost of diesel fuel that would otherwise be burned, then the solar system may be a good investment,” Lee and Dewi wrote.
They noted that for remote Alaska communities off the road system, the cost to fly or barge in diesel can effectively double the price of energy. 
In places like Ambler and Kobuk, where diesel fuel prices exceeded $15 per gallon in August 2023, solar power is clearly cheaper, the study found. In other places, it’s on par with diesel prices or slightly more expensive.
Lee said the study’s findings hold up unless diesel fuel prices fall and stay low.
“What could blow up these numbers is if you believe for the next 20 years that diesel oil prices will be cheap and diesel will be readily available. And if you believe that, you probably shouldn’t switch,” he said.
Operating with solar power for part of the year also provides health benefits, he said. Diesel exhaust can cause respiratory problems and has been linked to heart disease, among other health problems.
Alaska is exempt from some national air pollution standards, meaning that those health consequences are larger here than in the rest of the country.
Lee also said that relying on solar allows communities to set their budgets more easily, since they don’t have to account for the fluctuating cost of diesel fuel.
“I wouldn’t do solar if all you care about is cost. But I don’t believe that. I believe the prices are going to go up and down. They’re going to fluctuate. They’re going to create a lot of instability, and you’re better off with some solar in your system,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_0952-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-08 23:56:31.228776

Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) behind Moore at BWI Airport on Wednesday. (Photo by Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters)The federal government shutdown entered its eighth day Wednesday, which means it was also the eighth day that hundreds of essential federal workers at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport had to work without a paycheck.
“It’s a stunning contrast when we have federal workers who will continue to do their jobs with discipline and dignity, and distinction and pride — and we have a president who is going to shut down his own government and rob hardworking men and women from the paycheck they have already earned,” Gov. Wed Moore (D) said during a news conference in the BWI terminal Wednesday morning.
Moore was joined by a handful of state and federal Democratic elected officials who turned out to show their support for the furloughed federal workers and to criticize the Trump administration’s handling of the shutdown,  which those present called a “horror story” and “wicked.”
BWI currently has 550 Transportation Security Administration agents and 70 air traffic controllers, support staff and managers who are working without pay, said Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), who organized Wednesday’s event. Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) emphasized the dangers of the cuts to air safety personnel, and the burden that air traffic controllers and other airport workers are facing.
“Shutdowns don’t fly,” Elfreth said. “These folks are our neighbors, but they are the ones who keep our sky safe and make sure thousands of Americans can get where they need to go each and every day.”
U.S. Department of Transportation officials said that there were no flight delays Wednesday as a result of staffing shortages, a day after some scattered issues at airports across the country. But they said they are monitoring the situation and are concerned about the stress that unpaid work places on air traffic controllers, who were already understaffed.
Air traffic control staffing steady, but stress during shutdown worries DOT

Elfreth said there have been no significant impacts on BWI operations so far due to the shutdown.
Moore said a majority of federal workers will start missing a full paycheck Friday, the first payday since the start of the shutdown.
Lawmakers at BWI used Wednesday’s event to renew calls for an end to the shutdown, which Democrats said will happen when President Donald Trump and GOP leaders on Capitol Hill agree to negotiate an extension of health benefits that are set to expire this year.
Democrats are insisting the health subsidies be part of any vote to fund government operations. But Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) said Republicans in control would rather “shut down the federal government than support affordable health care for Americans.”
Republicans insist that they have voted to reopen the government and that it’s the Democrats who voted to shut the government.
“Governor Moore and Maryland Democrats talk about ‘supporting workers,’ but their actions tell a different story,” said Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) in a statement released by the Maryland Freedom Caucus.
Harris, the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, said he is also the only member of the delegation who has voted to keep the government open. When the House passed a stopgap spending bill on Sept. 19 to fund government operations through Nov. 21, all seven Maryland House Democrats voted against it — and Alsobrooks and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) have repeatedly voted against the House bill since it crossed over to the Senate, Harris said.
“They could end this shutdown today if they truly cared about Maryland families,” he said of the senators.
But Van Hollen and Alsobrooks said at the airport that they have repeatedly voted to keep the government open, by voting for a Democratic stopgap budget bill.
In addition to the House bill, the Senate is considering a bill from Democrats that would keep the government open through Oct. 31 and would make permanent the health insurance subsidies that are currently set to end at the end of the year. Without those subsidies, millions could lose health insurance, the Democrats say.
The Senate on Wednesday took up the competing bills for a sixth time, and for the sixth time they both went down to defeat, with Republicans voting for the House bill and Democrats voting for theirs. The government remains shut down, and each side is blaming the other for keeping it that way.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While workers could see their first payday without a check Friday, they have typically received back pay in the past once a shutdown ends. But Trump on Tuesday threatened to withhold back pay, despite signing a bill after the last shutdown, in 2019, that requires back pay by law.
Van Hollen, a sponsor of that law, described the White House’s threats as “fear mongering.” But he called it part of a pattern for an administration that has been dedicated to “shutting down the government in pieces from day one.”
Speakers at the event commended federal workers for their commitment during the shutdown, and throughout what Elfreth called the “last 10 months under the largest assault on federal employees this country has ever seen.”
“The president continues to resort to threats that use our federal employees as pawns instead of honestly showing up to the negotiating table and striking a bipartisan budget deal,” she said.
Along with words of encouragement and support, the lawmakers talked about the programs that are available to assist federal workers. But Moore cautioned that there’s only so much the state can do.
“No state is prepared to fill the enormous gap that is being created by this federal administration,” he said.
Rep. Johhny Olszewski (D-2nd) noted that the impacts of the shutdown go beyond federal workers, with Americans “suffering” because they are unable to access information or answers about topics such as loans or Social Security. But he praised the essential workers who are still showing up every day.
“My deepest thanks to the men and women who are federal employees across this country — people who are keeping our airports open, just like here at BWI,  who are showing up to work in our military, at Social Security, Department of Education — trying to meet the needs of their fellow Americans while their pay is being withheld,” Olszewski said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9948-1024x702.jpeg,,,2025-10-08 21:56:30.149842

I head to Falls Creek Valley, where I hope to find enough “wild Chugach blues” to do some serious berry picking.
Accessible from the Seward Highway, the Falls Creek Trail doesn’t attract nearly as many people as most paths into Chugach State Park’s Front Range. But that’s part of its appeal to me.
Even on a bluebird autumn day like this, I’ll meet only three other humans during my 7½-hour hike, none of them berry pickers. Few people searching for tundra blues would take this route, which requires an ascent of more than 2,000 vertical feet, much of it along an overgrown, muddy, and crumbling trail.
Only the most dedicated hikers reach the alpine bowl where tundra blueberries grow. And there’s no guarantee they’ll be present in any abundance.
Unlike most pickers, I like to fill my containers as part of a larger adventure. Normally I’ll spend only a couple of hours gathering blueberries, on an outing that might last several hours.
Given my berry-picking philosophy, it’s no surprise that the prospect of berry riches is only part of what has drawn me to Falls Creek on this glorious autumn day. The valley, especially its upper reaches, ranks high among my favorite places.
Over the past couple of decades I’ve come here dozens of times, usually accompanied by a mountain-loving dog. First Coya, who died in 2012, and more recently Denali.
Sadly, for both her and me, Denali has “aged out” of long, strenuous hill climbs like these. Now 13, she lacks the stamina to do hours-long ascents on steep trails. Or at least that’s my judgement. If I were to ask her, I’m sure she’d indicate she’s game.
I can see the disappointment in Denali’s eyes and body language when I grab my pack and assure her, “I’ll be back soon.” The hardest moments are those heading out the door. Sadness wells, accompanied by hints of guilt despite knowing it’s for the best, leaving my best-hiking-companion-ever behind.  
Memories of our adventures together reveal themselves, off and on, throughout my ascent, along with questions about my own aging body. Now in my mid-seventies, with arthritic shoulders and right knee, neuropathy (manifested in me by tingling numbness) creeping up my legs, and my own diminished stamina, I wonder how long I’ll be able to reach high places I once routinely visited.
I feel slow, my legs heavy, while ascending the lower sections of trail, which are among the route’s steepest. Despite what feels like a snail’s pace, I reach the alpine bench that opens into the valley’s upper bowl in just over two hours. That’s a decent time for an old guy, I smile to myself.
Once in the alpine bowl, I begin my hunt. The berries that I find are small, though firm and juicy, and widely scattered. My quart container fills slowly, while red and maroon leaves fill my hands, along with the purplish-blue fruits.
I’m about ready to call it quits when I notice a spot with bigger and more abundant berries. My second container fills much more quickly.

I’ve brought a third one, but two seems a good compromise on this glorious afternoon. I’d rather lounge a while, relish the distant presence of Dall sheep and the bright tundra tapestry, a gorgeous blend of yellows, oranges, reds, and purples. And yes, the azure sky and the bright and warming afternoon sun.
While sipping hot tea and munching snacks, I turn my gaze to the high country around me, places I’ve been and may some day return. More memories of Denali surface, a blend of hikes when she roamed this high country, grinning happily, in all her glory. “Hey girl, I miss you,” I say, and wonder if my thoughts can somehow reach her.
Finally I begin my departure from the high valley, stopping frequently to take in the place and all that it means.
Returning home, I embrace Denali and wonder: from the smells on body and clothes, can she sense the path I’ve taken and the places I’ve visited? If so, do they trigger memories of a valley and surrounding high places we once explored together, with great exuberance?
My love of Falls Creek Valley is inextricably connected to my experiences there with both Denali and Coya. And yes, the blueberries too. With a complicated mix of emotions, I whisper “thanks” that I’m still able to reach the high places where those wild blues offer both physical and spiritual nourishment.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Falls-Creek-Valley-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-08 21:56:30.149842

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)In the first public action in nearly two months amidst the state budget impasse, lawmakers in the Democratic-led House approved a $50.25 billion spending proposal and sent it to the Senate for consideration.
The 105-98 vote Wednesday followed an afternoon of heated rhetoric and finger pointing by House Democrats and Senate Republicans on the 100th day since the June 30 budget deadline passed without an agreement.
Pennsylvania is the only state in the country without some form of spending plan in place for the 2025-2026 fiscal year. 
The general appropriations bill, passed with the support of three GOP lawmakers, calls for a $2.4 billion  increase – or 5.1% – in spending over the 2024-2025 budget. It represents a further $300 million reduction in spending over a budget proposal the chamber passed in July.

It includes $565 million more for the commonwealth’s least wealthy school districts, as part of a plan to correct decades of inequality in the state’s education funding system. It also would provide $105 million more for basic education and $40 million more for special education. 
And it includes more than $785 million in savings for school districts as a result of a statewide tuition rate for cyber charter schools that the House passed in June. 
Major reductions in spending include cutting $49 million in state funding (on top of about $11 million in federal cuts) from the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and $38 million cut from the Department of Health due to $47 million in federal cuts.
The House budget is an amendment to Senate Bill 160, which was identical to the prior fiscal year’s budget.
Senate Republicans said Wednesday they weren’t prepared to hold a vote without adequate time to review the House plan. Both chambers adjourned until later this month.
“We have no idea what they’re doing over there,” Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said Wednesday before the vote. He added that Senate leaders have heard little from Democrats since Gov. Josh Shapiro inked a temporary fix for a transit funding crisis, which was an initial major sticking point in negotiations. 
“The degree of communication between the administration and House Democrats has been sparse at best,” Pittman told reporters.
Following the vote, Gov. Josh Shapiro excoriated Senate Republicans for going into recess without taking action.

“At some point, the Senate has to stop making excuses and show up for work to do their jobs. I spent the entire summer running back and forth between leader [Matt] Bradford and leader Pittman. I brought them together to have dialogue,” Shapiro said.
He called the Democratic proposal “a real compromise,” and said the budget will “cut taxes” and “protect the rainy day fund,” which are longtime conservative priorities.
Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) said the Democratic proposals have been too expensive, drawing down the state’s $3 billion budget surplus and rainy day fund, which reached a record $7.04 billion last month. 
Shapiro’s Feb. 4 proposal called for spending the surplus and drawing $1.6 billion from the rainy day fund to balance the budget. 
“I kept hearing today … ‘We’re not calling for a tax increase.’ Well, you might not be using those words, but when you’re spending that much more than what we are bringing in, you’re calling for a tax increase,” Ward said.
Shapiro also noted three Republicans voted for the House bill, and that Democratic leaders in the Senate believe they could achieve a unanimous vote in their caucus.
“There are obviously dynamics within the Senate Republican caucus that are making it very difficult for their leaders to find the necessary votes,” Shapiro said. “Here’s the thing though, that’s their job.”
Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia) said the upper chamber’s 23 Democrats were ready to vote for the compromise the House first passed in July. With the additional concessions in the bill passed Wednesday, Hughes expressed confidence it would receive enough Republican votes to pass. 
Hughes accused Senate Republicans of playing politics ahead of Shapiro’s reelection bid next year. He is expected to face a challenge from Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who is running for the party’s nomination. Garrity has inserted herself into budget politics by offering low-interest loans to county governments and head start programs. It has since been expanded to domestic violence prevention and rape survivor support groups.
On Wednesday, the Senate passed a bill that would allow her department to forgive the interest on those loans.
“These folks are putting the people last for political reasons for political purposes. They see their assessment as … you know, if we just delayed a budget and delayed a budget, that’s going to make all the Democrats look bad,” Hughes said.
Asked about the allegation, Pittman said his caucus wants responsible government and that Republicans have worked during the first two years of Shapiro’s term to bring compromises to the bargaining table. 
“I think he’s using that as a very poor excuse, because he’s not had the ability to bring a divided legislature that he talked so much about together on a consensus product,” Pittman said.
House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) said part of leading is persuading followers to accept difficult compromises.
“If you can’t tell the public, we’re not going to get everything we want and we have to compromise, then you shouldn’t be in leadership, and you damn well shouldn’t lead a caucus,” Bradford said.
But House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) said that despite frequent assurances the budget was “at the one-yard” line, Senate leaders have refused to negotiate in good faith, following “their leader in Washington, D.C.”
“We’ve got rape crisis centers closing. We’ve got county offices laying people off. We have senior centers closing their doors in Westmoreland and Indiana counties,” House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) said. “This is not a good afternoon, because it’s been 100 days, and the Senate Republicans are shutting this state government down.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5577-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-08 20:57:48.109998

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)LA GRANGE — The five-member board for Oldham County Schools unanimously rejected an Ohio-based nonprofit’s proposal to offer off-campus Bible-based character education during the school day after more than a half-hour discussion Wednesday evening. 
Oldham County citizens against LifeWise Academy’s proposal and those who supported the nonprofit’s efforts had been organizing for months ahead of the vote. More than 80 people  gathered inside the school district’s Arvin Education Center during the board’s special meeting to discuss the proposal. 
LifeWise Academy provides off-campus instruction to public school students around the country, and the nonprofit has organized teams to present proposals before school boards across Kentucky. In Oldham County, the nonprofit had proposed one hour of Bible-based character education on a weekly basis starting with students at Locust Grove Elementary School in third to fifth grades. 
School board chair Carly Clem said the decision had kept her up at night and divided the community. But ultimately, she said, she was concerned about the logistical challenges — concerns echoed by other board members — of LifeWise picking up and dropping off students at school multiple times a day.

“It is the potential for a massive logistical nightmare in my opinion,” Clem said, mentioning she was a Christian. “I like LifeWise. I think that the program that they’re offering sounds wonderful. It’s not that to me. It is more about protecting our staff.” 
Board member Suzanne Hundley said she was worried about the loss of instructional time for students, along with setting the precedent of allowing a third party to take kids out of school. 
“I don’t care if it was the National Wildlife Federation that wanted to come educate kids about ducks. I don’t think it belongs during the school day,” Hundley said. “We need to keep our kids in the school during the school day.” 
The debate surrounding LifeWise Academy’s proposal in Oldham County is a microcosm of debates happening at school districts over whether to allow third parties to offer “moral instruction” during the school day. 
The GOP-controlled Kentucky legislature passed a law this year, over the veto of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, allowing boards of education to permit off-campus “moral instruction” programs for students during school hours with the permission of parents. Local boards could allow up to one hour on one day of the week for such instruction. 
Other school boards in Kentucky have considered LifeWise Academy proposals this year; the board for Warren County Schools narrowly rejected a proposal while the board for McCracken County Schools approved a proposal. Marshall County Schools has had a LifeWise Academy program since 2023. 
The Ohio Capital Journal reported last month LifeWise Academy will be in nearly half of all school districts in Ohio this school year. Some of the nonprofit’s programs in Ohio have taken students on field trips to Kentucky museums that promote young Earth creationism, the belief that God created the universe 6,000 years ago in the span of six 24-hour days. 
Michael Slider, executive director of Kentucky Citizens for Democracy, which organized against the LifeWise Academy proposal, thinks the state legislature could again take up the issue of moral instruction in schools next year.(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
A group of Oldham County citizens called Kentucky Citizens for Democracy that organized against LifeWise Academy’s proposal had argued it could mean a loss of instructional time for students, in addition to concerns the group had about keeping religious instruction and public schools separated. 
Michael Slider, the executive director of the group, believes the issue of moral instruction in schools could appear before the state legislature again next year. Slider said some states require boards of education to accommodate third parties for moral instruction, while Kentucky’s current law gives boards of education the choice.
Earlier this year, Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a law that required school districts to create a religious instruction release time policy. Previously, Ohio school boards had discretion over whether to let children attend religious instruction during the school day. LifeWise Academy has expanded since the new law. 
“LifeWise has a mission to spread throughout the country. They make no bones about that,” Slider said. “We’ve had other states call us who are fighting the same battles who want to partner with us. … It’s going to be a national thing, and it’s going to be a long process.” 
Slider said he was “all about religious freedom” and didn’t have a problem with a group like LifeWise Academy offering after-school instruction similar to activities done by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. 
Cassie Allchorne, the LifeWise Academy program director in Oldham County, told reporters after the vote that she respected the demands of school staff but believed LifeWise Academy could have operated the “pilot program” at the elementary school smoothly. 
“God’s got a good plan,” Allchorne said. “Maybe in the future it can be an option. We’ll have to wait and see. So it’s obviously not going to happen now, and we’re okay with that.”

Adam Schiff of California and Tim Kaine of Virginia forced a procedural vote on the measure, which would have blocked the Trump administration from engaging in hostilities abroad without congressional approval. Two Republicans, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined nearly all Democrats voting in favor. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was the only Democrat to vote against advancing the measure.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 is a tool for Congress to check the balances of power of the executive branch by limiting the president's ability to initiate or escalate military actions abroad. Since September, President Donald Trump has approved four known military strikes in the Caribbean that have killed 21 so far, and, without offering evidence, said the boats were used by drug cartel members. “We call them water drugs,” Trump said about the most recent known boat strike on Oct. 3. “The drugs that come in through the water.”The White House has released few details of the strikes. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, also without providing any evidence, said on social media that the boats contained narcotics heading for the U.S.“Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route,” Hegseth wrote. “These strikes will continue until the attacks on the American people are over!!!!”Those attacks have taken place in international waters off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth added.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, in a statement, condemned the attacks as an “illegal incursion of combat aircraft from the United States.""Use of militaryIt’s illegal for the U.S. military to intentionally kill civilians who are not actively taking part in hostilities against the U.S. Senate Democrats and some Republicans have expressed skepticism about claims from the Trump administration that the boats were affiliated with drug cartels and have pushed the White House for more information on the boat strikes. Kaine said it’s possible that more people have died in the boat strikes, but they are seeking that information. He added that the strikes circumvent Congress’ authority to declare war. “We are vested with the power of declaring war. We ask basic questions,”  Kaine, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said. “Give us the intel about these particular boats, that they're actually carrying narcotics.”The Trump administration has argued that the strikes on the boats don’t warrant notification to Congress because they don't rise to the level of war, and that the attacks are in self-defense. Kaine said he rejects those arguments.“That's just an invented rationale,” he said. “Self-defense has always been understood (as) imminent attack, imminent invasion of the United States. It is not within the norm of self-defense to define a drugrunner's operation.” Paul said he is working on getting a briefing from the White House about the strikes and was skeptical that in the most recent strike, the four people killed were affiliated with drug cartels.“If they're members of a gang and you know them to be terrorists, and you're convinced enough to kill them, why shouldn't you know their names?” Paul said. Schiff said that since the first U.S. military attack near Venezuela in early September, the White House has not answered his and other lawmakers' questions on those missions. “We just have little or no information about who was on board these ships, or what intelligence was used, or what the rationale was, and how certain we can be that everyone on that ship deserved to die,” he said. Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973 to limit the president’s authority to wage war overseas after the Nixon administration secretly bombed Vietnam and Cambodia, killing hundreds of thousands of people.

It was a historic vote. Incorporated in 1956 by well-to-do hill dwellers trying to keep out the encroaching urbanity of nearby cities, the town’s “country residence zoning” rules only permit the construction of one type of building: Single-family homes, and no more than one per acre. 
But town officials felt they had no choice. Bowing to state mandates to plan for more residential development, they zeroed in on three sites with apartment potential. The most promising of the three was Twin Oaks Court,  a cluster of lots on a dead-end street sprouting from a frontage road along the I-280 freeway. State housing regulators signed off on the plan that spring.
Now, with a project proposed at Twin Oaks that would include the town’s first-ever affordable housing units, Los Altos Hills is having second thoughts.
Earlier this summer, the town council voted to amend its state-mandated development plan, cutting the number of new homes that could be legally crammed onto the site by nearly two-thirds.
Town officials and many local residents say the proposed changes to the municipal land-use blueprint, known as a housing element, still meet the letter of the state’s planning requirements while capping would-be development at a scale better suited to the town’s rural character. 
Packing hundreds of new residences along a narrow access road out of town is “totally inappropriate,” said Michael Grady, a retired lawyer who lives near the Twin Oaks site and who created an online petition calling on the town to revise its original plan. He said development at the densities initially permitted would snarl emergency access to and from the area, turbocharge traffic and disrupt local wildlife. 
Pro-development activists are characterizing the proposed change as a bait-and-switch by an affluent community trying to evade state housing law and their obligations to make space for new residents, including those with lower incomes. The typical price of a home in the town currently tops $5.5 million, according to Zillow. 
“Local agencies should not be allowed to amend their housing elements the moment that they are confronted with a real housing development project,” the California Housing Defense Fund, a legal advocacy group that regularly sues cities for violating state housing laws, in a letter to the California Department of Housing and Community Development last month. 
As far back as 2018, state housing department regulators, newly emboldened by a raft of California laws, have been sparring with municipalities over their state-mandated plans to make way for more houses and apartments. These battles have taken the form of lawsuits, threats of funding cuts and, in some cases, cities losing authority over local development entirely. Now, years into the process, most of California’s cities and towns have housing elements in place with the state’s certification.
The local tussle over Twin Oaks Court shows that getting the housing department’s seal of approval isn’t the end of the fight, but possibly the beginning of a new one. 
California housing regulators are slated to respond to the town’s proposed changes later this week. 
‘Testing the waters’
Cities across the state have reason to watch and see how things play out.
After receiving housing department certification for its housing plan in 2024, Carmel, a picturesque beach town in Monterey County, almost immediately began working to change it. The main goal: remove city-owned parking lots from the city’s list of potential affordable housing sites and replace them with less politically controversial alternatives. 
The town has yet to submit an amended version of its plan with the state, but formed a working group composed of town staff and a group of local activists opposed to development on the lots.
South Pasadena has likewise submitted its own amendment to reduce the number of new homes allowed, citing a calculation error that led to the original plan providing far more capacity than is required by law.
Other affluent towns have sought out such changes in the past — with mixed results. 
Earlier this summer, Rancho Palos Verdes in south Los Angeles County considered removing a handful of parcels from its state-approved list of developable properties. The town argued that its original plan included more development capacity than was strictly required under state law, so trimming the sites — including one with a proposed cluster of townhomes — was perfectly legal. The town eventually backed down in the face of threatened litigation. 
In May, Sausalito, a well-heeled suburb overlooking the San Francisco Bay, succeeded where Rancho Palos Verdes failed. The town amended its state-approved housing plan, reducing the amount that can be built at the site of a controversial condo project. The housing department approved the changes.
“We’re in the ‘testing the waters’ phase,” said Matt Gelfand, an attorney with Californians for Homeownership, which sues cities in Southern California for failing to plan or zone for enough housing. “If some smaller cities can get away with it, it’s going to be something that is employed by more cities.”
In evaluating each city’s proposed changes, the state housing department is tasked with distinguishing proposed amendments that fix legitimate flubs or that make reasonable alterations to existing plans from those made in bad faith in order to delay or quash proposed developments.
The developers behind the Twin Oaks Court site clearly see Los Altos Hills’ new plan as the latter. 
“I don’t think that is what the housing element amendment process is supposed to be for,” said Brian O’Neill, a lawyer representing the group of developers operating under the business name Twin Oaks Court LLC. “It is supposed to be for looking at and strengthening your housing policies, not as a method to kill housing projects.”
Los Altos Hills’ Mayor Kavita Tankha forwarded an emailed request for an interview to city manager Peter Pirnejad. Pirnejad said he and town staff did not have time to respond to a list of questions by the time this story was published.
How much is enough?
Local governments across California are on the hook under state law to plan for more than 2.5 million new homes before the end of the decade. Los Altos Hills’ share is 489. 
In trying to hit that target, the town leaned heavily on Twin Oaks. The site had a “realistic capacity” of 92 units, the plan noted. But the town’s specific proposal to rezone the parcels allowed for considerably denser development: Upwards of 250. 
Meanwhile, the other two sites identified as possible multifamily developments — campuses of the Saint Nicholas Catholic School and Foothill College — never looked especially promising.
“They shouldn’t get to weasel out of what they promised on the basis that they just noticed steep land is steep.”Anne Paulson, member, Los Altos Affordable Housing Alliance
The Diocese of San José, owner of the catholic school site, has “no intention of developing or selling” any part of the school, said spokesperson Cynthia Shaw. “Legal counsel clearly conveyed the Diocese’s opposition to the Town’s submission of the housing plan in 2022.” 
The Foothill College district initially expressed interest in building on-site housing for faculty and staff, but recently opted to purchase an apartment complex in nearby Mountain View instead.
Earlier this year, Twin Oaks Court LLC took the town up on its state-certified plan. The group filed a preliminary development application that maxed out the development capacity of the site — and then some. Making use of a series of state laws that let developers pack in more units if a certain share are for lower-income tenants, the project proposed building 598 homes. 
Density-averse town residents panicked. 
“This is exactly what we’ve been asking you to protect us from,” local resident Martha Bowden said, excoriating the town council after details of the proposal emerged in February. “This would be a disaster.”
“This is illustrative of exactly why I’ve been saying for over a year and a half that the housing element as drafted is a time bomb,” said Grady, the petition organizer. 
Not every spectator agreed. 
“After the housing element was accepted, residents and the council were wailing, ‘but it’s steep at Twin Oaks,’” said Anne Paulson, who has attended town hall meetings as a member of the Los Altos Affordable Housing Alliance. “They nevertheless chose those sites, instead of flatter sites down the hill. They shouldn’t get to weasel out of what they promised on the basis that they just noticed steep land is steep.”
The Twin Oaks developers have since reined in their plans. Their latest proposal includes a cluster of 334 single-family modular homes, including 56 set aside for lower-income residents. But that proposal is still bigger and denser than what would be allowed under the town’s proposed housing plan. The amended housing element cuts the number of allowable units to 92, the “realistic capacity” figure included in the original housing plan. 
That makes the new plan squarely consistent with state law, said Grady. The remaining housing capacity needed to hit the state’s target of 489 can still be met through a combination of the two school sites and less clustered development, like accessory dwelling units, he said.
“We only need 92 units” at Twin Oaks Court, he said. “I still think it’s inappropriate, but I could live with 92 units.” 
Pro-development advocates disagree. Housing regulators signed off on the town’s housing plan two years ago. Since then, the two proposed school sites have not been developed and more evidence has emerged to suggest that they won’t be anytime soon. 
Cities are “going to have to demonstrate, with substantial evidence, that these sites are likely to be developed…(despite) years of history demonstrating that there hasn’t been very much development,” said Gelfand with Californians for Homeownership. Municipal governments are “fantasizing” that they “can just take some sites off of our sites inventory and then just assume that the remaining sites are still valid just as they were a couple years ago. But that’s not how it works.”
Whether that is or isn’t how it works will ultimately depend on what housing regulators decide.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100125-Los-Altos-Hills-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C641&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 19:58:18.006526

As head of Clarity Development, he helped lead efforts to get that former Czech immigrant enclave designated as both blighted and historically significant — opening the door for public financing sources to boost redevelopment along the commercial spine leading toward Omaha’s world-class zoo.
McLeay also led construction of the 107-unit Little Bo Bungalows and Flats, ushering in one of the first new rental complexes to an aging area that’s seen trendy redevelopment emerge amidst structures dating back to the 1880s.
On deck now for the neighborhood, however, is McLeay’s largest swing yet.

Little Bo Village, a multifaceted Clarity project moving through the steps toward city government approval, would dramatically change the look of one square city block and parts of two others with 10 new or revamped buildings that contain a total of about 160 new residential dwellings, along with retail and recreational venues.
When done, the roughly $40 million investment, buttressed by $8.2 million in often controversial public tax-increment financing, would bring a swimming pool, pickleball courts and “country club” amenities to an area McLeay believes would otherwise attract more storage units and unkempt properties.
Also expected is an estimated 110 full- and part-time jobs, not counting some 100 temporary construction posts. The developer sees the hub as adding allure to a city seeking to recruit talent and improving job growth.
“I think it’s transformational,” McLeay said of the proposed village centered along the South 13th Street corridor south of William Street. “It’s the bridge connecting downtown to the zoo and starts the process of extending downtown Omaha farther south.”
‘Not rocket science’ 
He envisions the changing artery — home also to several other new retail and residential ventures from developers beyond Clarity, as well as long-established industrial businesses — as a new “front door” for visitors exiting Interstate 80 headed north toward Omaha’s downtown.
However, not all merchants and neighbors are rolling out the welcome mat. Key to their concern is lack of parking to accommodate the influx of people.
The village project comes with a request to change zoning to a “neighborhood business district,” a designation city planners say has no minimum parking space requirements. The anchor apartment complex near 14th and Briggs Streets, for example, is to contain 58 parking stalls for 113 residences and 4,250 square feet of retail space.

Guests to the area would rely on street and neighborhood area parking, said McLeay, who said many drawn to the area walk, carpool and use Uber service and scooters to get around. He said redevelopment of such urban pockets of housing and retail would not be financially feasible if parking ratios were as stringent as they are for the suburbs. 
Dave Hempel, whose family sheet metal business has been on the corridor for some 75 years, is among existing merchants who fear inadequate parking will create safety woes for pedestrians and residents.
Hempel said his business alone has 10 semi trucks delivering goods daily, and he questions how traffic flow would mix with the new projects’ customer-facing retailers.
“It’s not rocket science,” Hempel said. “You’re trying to highly populate an area not cut out for it. The idea of bringing all these multiresidential apartment buildings into an area like this is trying to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear and it’s really hard to do.”
Hempel said he welcomes progress, but he believes the high-density project was not coordinated well enough with area businesses and could hurt existing commerce. He said a recent restaurant across 13th Street from Hempel Sheet Metal Works already has moved, and another retailer has taken its place.
McLeay said parking gripes have surfaced in other near-downtown projects he’s worked on, including the popular midtown Omaha entertainment-focused Blackstone District. “It works itself out.”
To that, Hempel said: “They’re trying to compare this to a city like Chicago or New York. Well, this is Omaha, Nebraska. People are not taking Ubers and the bus lines and trams and public transportation, they never will. They’re going to want cars to get from point A to point B.”
 Zoning change hurdle

While the City Council already has approved the TIF public incentive for two related Little Bo Village proposals, the zoning changes still must be approved to green-light the venture.

Assistant City Planning Director Eric Englund expects those requests to come before the City Council in November or December. He said Omaha’s master plan supports rezoning the project area to the “neighborhood business district,” a designation that lifts any parking space minimum. Such zoning, he said, aims to encourage urban revitalization and preservation of historic commercial cores often developed along old streetcar routes.
Based on similar past cases, Englund said, it would be unusual for city officials to deny Clarity’s zoning request.
Neighborhood challenges often arise with a large influx of housing and commercial units, Englund said, noting the importance of adding more residential dwellings and strengthening the city’s core.
Shirley McNally, who has lived in the Little Bohemia area for 34 years, said she has not heard opposition from “real residents of our neighborhood” and does not believe the venture should be held up due to “real or imagined concerns” over parking in a neighborhood dotted with underutilized lots.
In a statement to City Council members, McNally said the opposition reminded her of small towns where a few opposed new ideas, “so a project died and so eventually did the town.” 
“It is exciting to see Little Bo revitalize and grow into a prosperous, interesting place to live,” she wrote.
 It’s personal 

For McLeay, who is working on the redevelopment with his wife and business partner, Colleen, the village has been years in the making. COVID-19, rising interest rates and construction costs delayed progress, he said.

He said his goal was to maintain the character of the enclave — including a plan to restore the 1890 tin-ceiling corner building once home to a dry goods store and later the Golden Goose bar and restaurant.  Two dilapidated wood-framed buildings on the same block would be returned to an original western-style facade. Among other structures headed for rehabilitation is the former neighborhood institution Donut Stop which, according to the National Register of Historic Places, was once occupied by the landmark Bohemian Café that later moved a few doors to the south.
An easier route, McLeay said, would be to scrape and build bigger. 
“We think we’ve found a creative way to that middle ground, to stay within the context of the neighborhood,” he said.
Retail tenants have yet to be secured, McLeay said, and they’ll likely bring their own brand names. He said he has had discussions with national and local restaurateurs.

Several storefronts not owned by Clarity would remain in the village mix, including stalwart O’Dowd’s vacuum shop along 13th Street, and Watie White’s art studio along William Street. White was among the earliest creatives in the area, turning an old 1890 storefront into his workspace.
McLeay said redevelopment efforts in the Little Bohemia area are personal, as his family roots in South Omaha harken to 1854 when his great-great-grandparents settled there from Europe. 
He said he’s sad to see disinvestment in South Omaha’s historic ethnic pockets, is worried about opposition to Little Bo Village but is hopeful his venture will be approved and completed as planned by summer 2027.
“That family history, knowing we’ve been here all this time — it’s meaningful,” he said.



 A Village 

Clarity Development presented its Little Bohemia vision to Omaha officials as two components: the Little Bo historic project and the Little Bo Village mixed-use project. 
Among proposed elements:
Former Golden Goose building, 1270 S 13th St., would be rehabbed with help of historic tax credits; 1,300 square feet of commercial space, an outdoor patio space and two second-floor market-rate apartments would be added.
The Donut Shop, 1256 S. 13th St., would be rehabbed also and used as a restaurant with outdoor dining.
Two historic buildings, 1316 and 1318 William St., to be rehabbed for a total of 4,100 square feet of main floor commercial space and two second-floor market-rate apartments.
New U-shaped apartment structure, 14th and Briggs Streets, would bring 113 market-rate dwellings and 4,250 square feet of first-floor commercial space. Five stories at its tallest point, it will include a 58-stall parking garage. 
New rowhouse structure, at the southern end of the “U” shape fronting 14th Street, would bring eight market-rate, stacked rental dwellings.
New two-story commercial structure, corner northeast of 14th and William Streets, to bring 2,400 square feet of bar and dining space on first floor, two market-rate apartment units on second level.
New three-story “slip-in” apartment structure, north side of William Street between 14th and 13th, to bring 20 market-rate apartments. 
New three-story, 10-unit “missing middle” apartment building, 1323 S. 12 St., would rise a bit farther from the village hub and nearer the previously-built Little Bo apartments east of 13th and north of William Streets. 
Little Bo Village “Country Club,” west of 14th Street and south of Briggs Street, would bring pickleball, a pool and bar with rooftop seating to a half-acre site.

O’Toole argues sports prediction markets are a significant threat to the state’s framework for gaming.,"Officials celebrated the launch of Maryland’s legal sports betting market at MGM National Harbor in December 2021 in Oxon Hill, Md. As many states legalize sports betting, officials are increasingly eyeing a certain type of wager known as a prop bet for increased regulation. (Photo by Shannon Finney/Getty Images for MGM National Harbor)In a letter written to the state’s congressional delegation on Wednesday, Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) Executive Director Kevin F. O’Toole says he’s concerned about the growing presence of sports prediction markets and the “significant threat” it poses on the state’s regulatory framework for gaming.
O’Toole is calling on Pennsylvania’s 17 U.S. House members and two U.S. Senators to urge the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to consider what he views as problems caused by a “dual-track system of state regulated legal sports wagering and purported futures trading on sporting events under the facade of federal regulation.”
“Sports prediction markets operate under the assertion that they are financial derivatives, or swaps, and therefore claim to not be gambling under state law,” O’Toole writes. “These markets effectively create a backdoor to legalized sports betting, operating parallel to, but outside of, the state-regulated system, and without strict oversight.”
The 2018 Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association recognized a state’s right to authorize and regulate sports wagering within its boundaries Following the ruling, Pennsylvania began to authorize intrastate sports wagering.
O’Toole argued the commonwealth’s system is designed to ensure consumer protections, responsible gaming, and the integrity of sporting events. He added that state-regulated sports betting operators in the state face significant requirements, including thorough background investigations, licensing fees, state taxation on gross gaming revenue, mandatory compliance with detailed rules providing consumer protections, responsible gaming provisions, and integrity monitoring.
“Perhaps most troubling, the CFTC regulates a system that also allows wagers on events that a single person can control — something the PGCB would never allow for fear of manipulation of the market and a cascading loss of confidence in the integrity of the betting system,” O’Toole wrote.
It would take the CFTC years to create the regulatory system and oversight needed for this, O’Toole argued.
The PGCB has the ability to penalize the operators if they don’t follow the statutory and regulatory requirements. O’Toole noted that is something an operator who “self-certifies” their contracts/wagers would never face.
“Even worse,” O’Toole concludes, “the parallel tracks risk confusing patrons who engage in these markets by utilizing the veneer of a highly regulated market when, in reality, their markets are more akin to the ‘wild west.’”
The Gaming Control Board  oversees all aspects of gambling in Pennsylvania involving 17 casinos, online casino games, retail and online sports wagering, and Video Gaming Terminals (VGTs) at qualified truck stops. It also regulates online fantasy sports contests. Casinos and other types of board-regulated gaming generated $2.8 billion in tax revenue and fees in the 2024-25 fiscal year.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sports-betting-Md.jpg,,,2025-10-08 19:58:18.006526

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota is offering an estimated 9,200 federal workers a lifeline through a loan program approved Wednesday to help military and other families affected by the government shutdown.
The North Dakota Industrial Commission approved the Furloughed Federal Employee Relief Program, which leverages the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to offer low-interest loans to cover lost wages. The short-term loans can be repaid after the federal government reopens and employees receive back pay.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who recently served in Congress, said the idea for the relief program started in his head in 2018 when he was flying to Washington, D.C., during a shutdown and was “read the riot act” by a Transportation Security Administration agent who was working without pay.
“And rightfully so. We ask those guys to go to work every single day in the middle of these shutdowns, regardless if they’re getting paid or not,” said Armstrong, a Republican who chairs the three-member Industrial Commission.
Shutdown day eight: Congress standoff unchanged as first missed federal payday nears

Federal employees who aren’t getting paid will be able to apply for 2% loans through a North Dakota bank or credit union for up to three months of their take-home pay. Applications will be accepted starting Friday. Information on how to apply is available at the Bank of North Dakota’s website. Borrowers will have five months to repay the loans.
Industrial Commission officials estimate the total number of eligible North Dakota federal employees, including those stationed on two Air Force bases, is about 9,200 people. 
“The ones that are going to work every day protecting our country, the ones that go to work every day making sure we get on airplanes, are actually the people most likely to be living paycheck to paycheck,” Armstrong said.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
Grand Forks Mayor Brandon Bochenski, who participated in the announcement of the program, said his city is home to a lot of federal workers in addition to those at the Grand Forks Air Force Base.
“This is really going to help the rank and file,” Bochenski said. “Grand Forks is so grateful, and this is truly North Dakota at its finest.”
Rick Clayburgh, president of the North Dakota Bankers Association, encouraged federal employees to reach out to their local banks. The program is also available to new customers of North Dakota banks.
Don Morgan, president and CEO of the Bank of North Dakota, said the program is modeled after disaster relief programs the bank has done in the past. The Bank of North Dakota will buy the loans and pay each lender a service fee of $250.
The federal government shutdown entered its eighth day on Wednesday with neither Republican or Democrat funding plans receiving the 60 votes necessary to advance. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected 750,000 federal workers would be furloughed during the shutdown.
Phil Davis, Workforce Services director for North Dakota Job Service, said as of Friday, 10 federal employees had filed for unemployment since the start of the shutdown.  
Trump floats plan to deny back pay to furloughed federal workers after shutdown

He said federal employees may be holding back on filing because the unemployment benefits would have to be repaid if the workers are awarded back pay. 
President Donald Trump floated the idea this week that furloughed employees would not be entitled to receive back pay after the government shutdown ends. 
The North Dakota loans do not require collateral, but are guaranteed by the back pay owed to federal workers.
Armstrong said there is a law that guarantees the back pay of furloughed federal employees, noting he voted to support it in 2019 as a member of Congress.
“The law says they get it,” he said. “There will be a tremendous amount of bipartisan support to protect the law that passed.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The families of two Utah teenagers have dropped their lawsuit challenging the state’s ban on transgender players in girls’ sports. 
The families and the Utah High School Activities Association agreed to the dismissal of the case with prejudice, meaning it can’t be refiled later on, according to a Monday court filing.
The end to the case comes after more than three years of legal wrangling and after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed over the summer to hear similar cases from Idaho and West Virginia. In those cases, lower courts sided with transgender athletes seeking to compete, and the states appealed. 
After state lawmakers passed Utah’s ban in 2022, the families of the two transgender athletes sued in Salt Lake City’s 3rd District Court. A judge placed the prohibition on hold while the case played out, triggering the start of a state commission fielding requests from transgender girls seeking to compete in high school sports. 
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz said on social media that with the lawsuit over, Utah’s ban is law and the commission will be dissolved. 
“This is a major win for fairness, safety, and the preservation of women’s sports in Utah,” Schultz, R-Hooper, said in a post on X. 
The families of the Utah teens had argued the ban singled them out for being transgender, violating their rights to due process and equal treatment under Utah’s constitution. 
“Our plaintiffs — young, courageous girls — showed remarkable strength under scrutiny,” said Aaron Welcher with the ACLU of Utah, which represented the families. “Our commitment to transgender youth continues, because protecting one group’s rights protects everyone’s.”
Attorneys for the families and the state wrote in this week’s court filing that “the parties will bear their own respective costs, expenses, and fees.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A survey of the commercial horticulture food crops industry in Iowa showed direct specialty crop sales of more than $79 million in 2022 and even higher figures of economic output attributable to the industry. 
Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced the results of the 2023 survey  Wednesday and said it shows the local produce industry is “diverse, growing, and making a significant contribution to Iowa’s economy and agricultural identity.” 
The survey was sent to Iowa specialty crop producers who grow edible crops like vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, honey, maple syrup, herbs, mushrooms and pumpkins. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to a news release from IDALS, this is the first “comprehensive look” at the industry since 2015. 
More than 850 specialty farmers participated in the survey, which found that a total of 11,650 acres of specialty crops were grown in 2023. 
Sales from these farms had a statewide economic output of $66.5 million in 2023 and supported $29.9 million in labor. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the survey “confirms the economic strength of specialty crop producers.” 
“Iowa’s horticulture food crops sector is an important part of our agricultural economy and a defining feature of the diversity and vibrancy of Iowa agriculture,” Naig said. 
Most of these farms are small, grow multiple products and sell directly to consumers. These farmers skew young with nearly 50% of respondents below the age of 35. 
The survey found the average age of Iowa specialty crop producers was 57.2 years, which is lower than the national average, 58.1 years, of producers in the U.S. according to the latest Census of Agriculture.  
The majority of specialty farm producers responded that they also work-off farm jobs and 37% responded they work full-time jobs off the farm in addition to running the farm. 
The average farm size for these edible crops was 7.8 acres, though many farms are quite a bit smaller considering the median farm size was just 2.8 acres. The survey also found that just 4% of farms had crop insurance. 
From 1989 to 2000, the number of specialty farms in Iowa declined from 1,400 farms to 938 farms, according to the survey results. The industry has since rebounded, with 1,680 farms counted in 2023. 
The results show the total number of sales of edible specialty crops increased by 73% from 2012 to 2022, with inflation-adjusted figures. The survey results show direct edible specialty crop sales amounted to $79 million in 2022. 
In addition to growing on average 3.8 distinct specialty crops, farmers also diversify their operations with on-farm activities. Nearly 60% of surveyed farms participate in some form of agritourism, which they reported generated $6.6 million in income.
Farmers also increase their sales with value-added products, or products that have been processed in some way, like canned vegetables or wine. The survey results show edible specialty crop farms sold an estimated $11.3 million in value-added products in 2023. 
Naig said he believes the Iowa edible specialty crop industry will continue to grow, especially with the expansion of the department’s marketing service, Choose Iowa. Naig said these farmers also help connect Iowans to their food sources. 
“With the continued expansion of the Choose Iowa program, I believe this sector is well-positioned for even greater growth in the years ahead,” Naig said. “Horticulture food crops bring opportunities not just for established farms but also for beginning farmers who are shaping the future of our industry.” 
Honey, peppers, apples, tomatoes and lettuce were the top edible specialty crops grown in Iowa. According to survey results, the number of honey producers in the state has “dramatically increased” as there were fewer than 200 producers in 1997 and there were 1,229 in 2022. 
The other top crops had between 400 and 550 producers each in 2022. Producers who sold through Community Supported Agriculture programs or at farmers markets were more likely to grow a higher variety of crops. 
According to the release from IDALS, the report, which was produced primarily by the department and staff from Iowa State University Extension and Outreach, will help lawmakers and department leaders to “better support specialty crop farmers and help them overcome challenges, seize new opportunities, and sustain growth.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-08 23:21:04+00:00,CT Mirror,From Little League dreams to collegiate realities,Christine Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/08/little-league-dreams-to-collegiate-realities/,"Opportunities once reserved for professionals now extend to college and even high school athletes, with the pressure filtering further down.","The remarkable run of Fairfield National in this year’s Little League World Series took me back to 1989, when I watched Trumbull’s team make history. For many of those boys, that magical summer planted seeds of determination, commitment, and resilience – qualities that have served them well long after the cheers faded.
The experience, as members of the ’89 team recently recalled, transcended baseball, Trumbull, and the key lessons of sport. Ken Martin, now a successful business owner nationwide, recalled how quickly 12-year-olds had to grow up when suddenly faced with media attention, community expectations, and national visibility. Jason Hairston remembered the “crash course” in maturity, knowing how to act around presidents, professional athletes, and TV cameras.
Fast-forward 35 years, and while the core lessons of teamwork, perseverance, and hard work remain timeless, the context is dramatically different. ​​​​Today’s young athletes grow up under a brighter spotlight – offering greater opportunity, but also greater exposure and pressure. They now look ahead to a collegiate landscape where student-athletes are not only praised but also paid. and the ripple effects of that shift are cascading downward to younger and younger levels of play.
Consider last year’s LLWS champions from Lake Mary, Florida. After Disney World celebrations, major league first pitches, and hometown parades, they returned to middle school, but their visibility didn’t end there. It extended online, where likes, followers, and viral moments can create a brand before a child is even a teenager. One player has more than 3,000 Instagram followers, and the team account drew thousands more.
The new reality for parents and athletes
This new reality has only intensified since the NCAA’s 2021 adoption of its name, image and likeness policy (NIL) and the 2025 NCAA v. House settlement. College athletics has become a marketplace not just of performance, but of marketability. Opportunities once reserved for professionals now extend to college and even high school athletes, with the pressure filtering further down. Parents of young athletes are left asking: What if my child is next? How do we safeguard their growth amid this commercial rush?
I remain a strong believer that youth sports should be about fun, development, and community. But families also cannot ignore the evolving pressures of a system where money, branding, and influence play an increasingly central role in shaping an athlete’s future.
Considerations for student-athletes pursuing high school or college athletics:
Know your rights. The rules of NIL are shifting and unsettled (and hopefully will be in a more stable place by the time today’s young athletes reach college). Institutions and conferences are often driven by power and profit, so it’s important to understand and protect your rights as an athlete.
Beware eligibility risks. For athletes and parents of athletes entering high school, beware of eligibility risks. High school and college athletic associations may impose penalties if an athlete accepts compensation that violates their rules. What looks like a small deal today could jeopardize scholarship opportunities tomorrow. 
The landscape is especially confusing as rules continue to shift. Just recently, the NCAA proposed that incoming Division I athletes report all NIL deals dating back to their junior year of high school or junior college through NIL Go, despite existing state laws and high school association regulations.
Uneven playing field. The current structure favors high-revenue sports. Dominant sports capture most money and exposure; women’s and non-revenue sports face uncertain paths. Families in women’s and non-revenue sports must be especially proactive in protecting and planning for their athlete’s path. For women athletes, knowing what protections Title IX provides is critical. 
Protect the whole athlete. Financial education, mental health support, and legal guidance are vital early. Building this ecosystem helps young athletes manage pressures and real-world challenges that come with visibility and money.
Above all, remind young athletes that passion for the game, love of competition, and commitment to teamwork are the foundations for lasting success. The commercial elements can be navigated without losing sight of these core values.
Fairfield’s magical run will always belong to them, their teammates, and their community. But their story also highlights a new reality: talent and opportunity arrive earlier than ever, and families must be ready to balance that promise with protection.

Kim Reynolds answered questions at the Free Enterprise Summit hosted by the Common Sense Institute of Iowa in Des Moines March 11, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed an executive order Wednesday requiring state government departments to verify immigration and citizenship status through the federal E-Verify and SAVE systems when granting occupational and professional licenses.
The executive order comes following the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement arrest Sept. 26 of former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts, who had been given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024. DMPS officials said Roberts completed the the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted other required documentation confirming his ability to legally work in the U.S. when he was hired in 2023.
But the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, responding to a request for more information on the Roberts’ case from U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, said Roberts’ immigration status would have been flagged if DMPS had used E-Verify, the federal web-based system checking job applicants’ ability to work legally in the U.S. using federal documentation. The school district had never been enrolled in the E-Verify system, according to DHS.

Reynolds’ Wednesday order requires all state government departments to use E-Verify, as well as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database, known as SAVE, to verify the employment eligibility of people seeking to become state employees, as well as for applicants seeking state-issued occupational and professional licenses.
Roberts was granted an administrator license by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners in July 2023, which was revoked in September following his arrest.
“While it’s the responsibility of employers to ensure those they hire are eligible to work in the United States, in light of recent events with the former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, I am issuing Executive Order 15, putting safeguards in place that will verify the legal immigration or citizenship status for anyone requesting a state-issued professional license before they provide services for Iowans or are entrusted with the health, safety or education of our communities,” Reynolds said in a statement. “Additionally, as an employer, the state takes seriously its responsibility to verify work eligibility. While some agencies voluntarily use E-Verify as part of the hiring process, my executive action now makes it a requirement.”
The executive order requires each state agency, as well as the Board of Regents, to use use E-Verify to confirm the employment eligibility of newly hired employees, in addition to requiring state agencies to verify the U.S. citizenship and immigration status of people who apply for professional licenses from the state.
The order also establishes a “SAVE Program Clearinghouse” in order to access the SAVE database and establish legal authority to verify citizenship and immigration status. The SAVE database is also what the Iowa Secretary of State’s office has accessed to confirm the citizenship status of people registered to vote in Iowa.
While Reynolds’ order applies to state agencies and the licensing process, state lawmakers may consider adding E-Verify requirements for other employers in the 2026 legislative session. Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh said in a statement Tuesday that he expects “E-Verify and other issues to address illegal immigration will continue to be a topic of conversation amongst Senate Republicans over the coming weeks and months heading into the legislative session.”
In recent years, Senate Republicans have passed legislation requiring employers use E-Verify and prohibiting businesses from knowingly employing an “unauthorized alien employee” — measures that have failed to advance in the Iowa House.

Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, and Sen. Jim Petty, R-Van Buren, conduct the committee's meeting on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The only way lawmakers can restore funds that have been withheld from 43 municipalities is to expunge a vote they took in July to prevent the state treasurer from releasing the money, the attorney general’s office opined this week.
The Legislative Joint Auditing Committee last month directed Arkansas State Treasurer John Thurston to restore so-called turnback funds that had been withheld because the affected towns and cities had failed to file required audits of their water and sewer systems by July 1, 2024.
Arkansas lawmakers agree to return withheld funds to 40 municipalities after two-hour debate

That vote had no legal authority, according to the attorney general’s opinion, issued Monday and authored by Assistant Attorney General William R. Olson. Thurston’s office requested the opinion after the Joint Auditing Committee’s vote in September.
According to the opinion, Act 453 of 2023 requires municipalities to submit water and sewer system audits to the auditing committee within 18 months of the end of the audit’s fiscal year. If those audits are not submitted, the committee may — but is not required to — direct the state treasurer to withhold turnback funds until the reports are submitted.
However, once the treasurer is directed to withhold the funds, it is required to do so, and it can only release them if it receives notice from Joint Auditing that “a municipality has submitted all applicable reports concerning water and sewer systems,” according to the opinion.
When the committee voted last month to return the funds, it was with the requirement that each municipality submit the missing audits by Dec. 31 or provide a letter from a certified public accountant that the audit would be submitted by that date.
“An engagement letter from a municipality promising to complete an audit and submit reports in the future does not satisfy the statutory condition for the release of funds,” the AG’s opinion said.
However, Olson said that if the committee expunged the initial vote to withhold the funds, then the “expunged notice would be treated as though it were never sent.”
“It is my opinion that a successful motion to expunge would authorize the Treasurer to release the withheld funds from the date of the July 2025 notices to the date of expungement because it is as if the original notice never existed,” Olson wrote.
Last month, Sen. Dave Wallace, R-Leachville and sponsor of Act 453, proposed restoring the funds with a grace period, arguing that the loss of the funds would harm small towns without the resources to get the audits done. Some lawmakers raised concerns that the vote was not legal.
“If we can’t come down here and make decisions that affect our state, we might as well go ahead and stay home and play dominoes,” Wallace said at the time.
Local governments receive two types of “turnback funds” from the state. General revenue turnback funds support basic local services such as emergency response. Turnback funds from state highway revenue go to municipalities and are required to be spent on maintaining roads that are continuations of state highways or former state highways.
Committee Co-Chair Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, said she did not believe lawmakers could expunge the vote this week during Legislative Joint Auditing’s monthly meeting because it wasn’t on the agenda. However, she said she was meeting with the House parliamentarian on Thursday to determine next steps and how an expungement vote might be done.
“This is completely new territory,” Lundstrum said in an interview. “Audit is considered Switzerland — it’s neutral, it’s not political, it’s not anything but numbers. It’s kind of the cold, hard facts type of deal. This is uncharted territory, it’s never been done. So we have to be real careful about what we’re doing.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)UNC Chapel Hill professor Dwayne Dixon returned to campus Wednesday to teach his first class after a suspension for alleged ties to an anti-racist, anti-fascist group was lifted last week.
In a news conference on campus, Dixon condemned the university’s actions as “glaring violations on my constitutional rights,” criticizing UNC Chancellor Lee Roberts for placing him on leave and barring him from university grounds.
“Chancellor Roberts, rather than pausing to reflect, think deeply — all the things we want our students to do in classrooms — was easily led through the nose through foolish online conjecture and inference into a very regrettable, embarrassing decision,” he said. “The actions by the chancellor against me reveal again just how imperiled our right to free and unfettered speech is.”

A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on Dixon’s remarks or on the remarks of others who spoke at the event.
Dixon’s suspension came after Fox News published a story alleging he was a member of a group related to another organization that posted fliers on Georgetown University’s campus making light of the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That story prompted a Turning Point USA spokesperson to demand Dixon be “immediately fired.”
He was reinstated five days later after student and faculty protests, petitions, and a letter threatening legal action from the ACLU of North Carolina. A UNC spokesperson wrote that a threat assessment “found no basis to conclude that he poses a threat to University students, staff, and faculty, or has engaged in conduct that violates University policy.”
Roberts said in a faculty council meeting on Friday that he was also motivated by a 2018 video of Dixon that came to his attention over the weekend where he was “loading a semiautomatic weapon and then firing that weapon” while “talking about the need for confrontation.”
A former member of Redneck Revolt, an anti-fascist “community defense formation” that encouraged bearing arms for self-defense, Dixon was arrested in 2017 for bringing a rifle to an anti-Ku Klux Klan rally in Durham. The charges were dismissed, as was a 2018 assault charge from a protest where UNC’s confederate statue was taken down.
“What I’m doing in that video is something that millions of Americans do every day, which is plinking targets, plinking cans, right?” Dixon said Wednesday. “The use of my Second Amendment [rights] is hardly reason or justification for such a severe draconian action on his part.”
Dixon added that at the Durham protest, he carried his rifle at “the very early stages” of the protest to deter violence in case KKK members showed up for a confrontation. “Once there was enough people to ensure wider safety, I unloaded and put away my rifle.”
Dixon and his supporters warned Wednesday that his swift removal from the campus is part of a larger troubling crackdown on speech on university campuses.

“This is not an isolated incident, but a pattern of misconduct by our administration,” said Pragya Upreti, a public policy student who helps lead TransparUNCy, a student accountability initiative. “We have watched the administration relentlessly intimidate faculty, students, surveil classrooms, monitor syllabi and emails and brutally crack down on student protest.”
Cultural studies professor Michael Palm, president of the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of the American Association of University Professors, praised student groups and civil rights organizations that stood up for Dixon for “fighting to retain our basic rights to free speech, to free assembly, and to academic freedom.”
“All of these groups have also been working to keep nonresident students, faculty, and staff safe and to ensure their same rights in the face of ICE raids on campus and the threat of being deported for speaking in support of Palestinians,” Palm said. “All UNC administrators have said is that they’ll follow the law.”
Dan Siegel, deputy legal director of the NC ACLU, said the tactics used against Dixon are the same that have deprived students demonstrating against the war in Gaza of their rights.
“Last year, right here in Polk Place, there was a peaceful demonstration where people were demonstrating about the war in Gaza. In response, the university indefinitely banned many of these peaceful demonstrators,” he said. “Even though the university has never even suggested they posed some kind of threat to campus safety, they remain banned today.”
Dixon made the same comparison, concluding his remarks by exclaiming, “Free Palestine!” He said that right now, it just feels “amazing” to be back in the classroom.
“I’m so excited to see them. I’ve graded a bunch of papers that I wasn’t able to access last week, so I feel finally caught up on work, and we have really important things to cover this week in both of my classes,” he said. “I’m just going to be overjoyed to see them.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dwayne-Dixon-News-Conference-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-08 19:58:18.006526

Research shows that the large felines are resilient to human disturbance and return to finish off carcasses.
The post What happens when you come upon a feasting mountain lion? A Wyoming study tells the story. appeared first on WyoFile .","Justin Clapp’s introspection about his own impact on mountain lions is partly what sparked a scientific examination of how the big cats respond to being bumped off carcasses mid-feast.
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s large carnivore biologist, along with colleagues and fellow researchers, repeatedly displaced feeding cats — 26 individual research animals — while trying to answer questions about how, or if, lions selectively prey upon vulnerable, chronic wasting disease-stricken ungulates in the Laramie Mountains. 
“From an ethical standpoint, when we collar animals, we are asking a lot of them,” said Clapp, who’s also a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wyoming. “We don’t take that lightly. We recognized that, if we were going to get to kill sites quick enough to get a CWD sample, then we were probably going to be at a lot of these sites while those animals are still feeding.” 
Those inevitable displacements could have cascading effects. Perhaps lions, once bumped off carcasses, moved on to kill their next meal quicker, which in turn could theoretically impact prey species like elk and mule deer. 
But Wyoming researchers tracking 16 toms and 10 adult females from 2019 to 2023 discovered just the opposite. Clapp, along with Wyoming Game and Fish’s Justin Binfet, Idaho Fish and Game’s Cade Bowlin and University of Wyoming ecologist Joe Holbrook, recently published their findings in a peer-reviewed study. Its title hints at the results: “Large carnivore feeding is resilient to human disturbance.” 
“We really did not see carcass abandonment,” Holbrook said. “And even more interesting, as a lion experienced [more] encounters with humans, the probability of them returning back to the carcass increased. So there was some evidence of habituation and learning.”

The kill rates of feeding mountain lions actually decreased, the researchers found, because the displacements extended their time at any one carcass. 
By and large, the findings buck conventional scientific thinking. Humans have long been regarded as “superpredators,” and people, primarily houndsmen, pose a lethal risk to the cats in a state where they’re heavily hunted. And so it wouldn’t have been especially surprising if lions were easily disturbed and abandoned carcasses when confronted by teams of biologists.
Mountain lions, to be clear, did move off of their venison meals. 
“We did not encounter one instance of cats defending the carcass,” Clapp said. The only behavior that could be categorized as aggression was encountered when the biologists went to examine a cluster of GPS points that was suspected to be a carcass, but instead ended up being a den full of kittens. 
This study area map shows field investigations of mountain lion feeding sites that resulted in human disturbance (red) and undisturbed feeding events (black) in central Wyoming between 2019−2023. (Proc. R. Soc.)
Over the course of the study, biologists and technicians identified feeding activity at 745 sites. Clapp, Holbrook and the other researchers parsed the data in a way that identified 106 instances of human disturbance. 
Of those, 25% of the time there were “direct encounters,” when the scientists either saw or heard the cats. The remainder were identified via GPS data and were labeled “proximity encounters.” 
Disturbed cats did flee and leave the area more than 70% of the time, the research showed. But 72% of the time, those cats returned. In total, lions either never left the immediate area or returned to their kill site after a disturbance 80% of the time. On average, they moved off by two-thirds of a mile, and they were gone for about 13 hours. 
The data amassed in the Laramie Mountains also showed just how quickly disturbed cats smartened up. Every time they got bumped off a carcass, there was a corresponding 22% increase in the odds that the mountain lion returned. 
Clapp emphasized that the study results are not intended to downplay the effect that human activity can have on mountain lions, or any species. But the findings exemplify the impressive resilience and intelligence of apex predator species like mountain lions, he said. 
“We need to make sure that we’re giving them credit for their adaptability and for the way that they can continue to persist, reoccupy, expand, despite the things that humans do,” Clapp said. “While I’m not saying that human disruption is good for any type of wildlife, we need to make sure that we’re acknowledging the fact that these animals are pretty incredible and they’re very smart.”

They want another day in court.,"Gun owners last month lost their constitutional challenge of a New Jersey law banning guns in sensitive places. They want another day in court. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Gun owners who last month lost their fight to topple a 2022 state law banning guns in sensitive places are asking the full 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to hear the case again, saying a three-judge appellate panel erred in upholding carry restrictions on “nearly every inch of public space in New Jersey.”
Attorneys representing Ronald Koons, Aaron Siegel, and other unnamed gun owners argued Wednesday that the panel’s Sept. 10 precedential split decision conflicts with a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared gun carry a constitutional right. In a ruling known as Bruen, the nation’s top court barred states from requiring carry permit applicants to prove a need to take their gun outside their home or business.
“By the (3rd Circuit) panel’s admission, the issues this case presents carry ‘immense public importance.’ Yet the panel got several of these exceptionally important issues exceptionally wrong,” the attorneys wrote.
They added: “The panel opinion transforms a fundamental constitutional right into a mere privilege that states can withhold at will.”
Bruen required policymakers to root any gun restrictions in the history and tradition that existed when the nation’s forefathers drafted the Second Amendment, the attorneys noted. In their petition, they quote liberally from a fiery dissent penned by Judge David J. Porter, a Trump appointee who accused the other two jurists on his panel — both appointed by Democrats — of various errors and an “anachronistic disdain for public carry.”
“The panel here refused to treat ‘the Second Amendment’s meaning as fixed at the Founding or at the Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification,’ and instead relied on ‘late-blooming regulations unconnected to early-American tradition,’” the attorneys wrote, citing Porter’s dissent.
Spokespeople for the state attorney general’s office, which has fought to uphold the law, did not respond to a request for comment.
The majority decision by Judges Cheryl Ann Krause and Cindy K. Chung was “premised on the assumption that bearing arms for self-defense is a public nuisance rather than a constitutional right,” the attorneys argued.
The ruling allows states to violate people’s right to bear arms in public for self-defense by banning guns at parks, beaches, playgrounds, zoos, casinos, public transit, healthcare facilities, public film sets, youth sports events, public libraries and museums, concert arenas and other entertainment facilities, bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, and other public gathering places, they wrote.
“The panel’s decision rubber-stamping New Jersey’s effort to deem nearly everything a ‘sensitive place’ renders Bruen a dead letter,” they wrote.
They added: “The issues at stake are far too important to let that decision be the last word on the constitutionality of New Jersey’s outlier regime.”
Beyond the ban on guns in sensitive places, the gun owners’ attorneys also disputed the constitutionality of the law’s requirement — which Krause and Chung let stand — that carry applicants get four “reputable,” non-family people to vouch for them.
“Bruen was emphatic: ‘[G]ranting licensing officials discretion to deny licenses based on a perceived lack of need or suitability’ violates the Second Amendment,” the attorneys wrote.
If the full court agrees to rehear the case, both sides will present their arguments in Philadelphia to a cadre of 23 appellate judges, 13 of whom were appointed by Republican presidents and 10, by Democratic presidents.

(Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The gambling company that exclusively supplies the state’s lottery equipment and technology confirmed it was hit with a data breach last year that exposed the personal information of over 6,300 Rhode Islanders.
Brightstar Lottery Group, formerly International Game Technology (IGT) PLC, alerted Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha via a letter on Oct. 3 that “an unauthorized third party” gained access to parts of its internal corporate system on Nov. 17, 2024.
Upon discovery of the breach, the company “took immediate action” to secure its internal systems and investigate the depth of the impact, wrote Associate General Counsel Macaire Piscione
Brightstar’s review concluded on Aug. 21 and found 103,879 people were impacted — including 6,354 Rhode Island residents. The company’s website notes that it serves “over 90 global customers in more than 100 jurisdictions” including licensing agreements in Connecticut and Maine.
Under state law, a data breach must be reported no later than 45 calendar days after its confirmation. If at least 500 people are impacted, the attorney general’s office must be notified.
Information that was available through the Brightstar systems that were accessed included names, contact information, dates of birth, drivers licenses, Social Security numbers, and financial account details.
Most of those affected by the breach were current and former employees, Brightstar spokesperson Mike DeAngelis said in an email to Rhode Island Current Wednesday. He added that the company is not aware of any misuse of personal information.
“The privacy and security of personal information is of utmost importance to us,” he said in the emailed statement.
As a precaution, he said Brighstar is offering anyone impacted by the breach 24 months of credit monitoring, fraud detection, or dark web monitoring. Anyone affected will receive a written notice from the company.
The company rebranded its global lottery division to Brightstar in June as part of its July 2024 acquisition by New York-based Apollo Global Management Inc. to gain IGT’s name, slot machine, digital gaming and sports betting operations while taking them private. 
IGT in 2021 had signed a 20-year agreement to supply the state’s lottery and scratch tickets, video lottery and slot machine technology. Brightstar, the publicly-traded lottery company that remains, continues to fulfill its obligations to the Rhode Island Lottery.
The Rhode Island Lottery did not immediately respond to request for comment.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)Beckley, W.Va. — A judge overseeing two consolidated lawsuits in a legal battle over West Virginia’s school vaccine law and religious freedom will consider every family that has asked for a nonmedical exemption to the law together as a party to the lawsuit, and he expects to issue a statewide ruling, he said Wednesday. 
Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble granted a motion certifying class action in the case of Miranda Guzman and other Raleigh County families suing the West Virginia and Raleigh County boards of education to make them recognize religious exemptions to the shots. 
Ruling from the bench Wednesday, Froble said he believes the case before him is about the state Board of Education’s uniform policy not to accept nonmedical exemptions.
“One of the issues, I guess, to address is the parties have argued back and forth as to whether this court can do anything outside of Raleigh County, and the court believes it can and will, depending upon the evidence in the case,” Froble said. “It does have the jurisdiction to issue a statewide injunction and or declaratory judgment against the state Board of Education.”
Froble ruled in July that students who are party to the case may attend school with a religious exemption. That ruling applied only to those students. Wednesday’s hearing was a continuation of a hearing on permanent injunction the court began in September. 
A state health official testified Wednesday that the health department has fielded about 575 requests for nonmedical exemptions to the vaccine law, all of which have been approved. 
One of the reasons a class action lawsuit makes sense, the judge said, is to prevent potentially all of those cases being brought individually against school officials all over the state. 
“That would be a nightmare, because, not only the possibility of inconsistent decisions, but it’d be difficult, because the plaintiffs in a lot of these cases would have to probably go pro se,” he said. “[They w]ould not have the benefit of counsel, even though the [Equal Protection for Religion Act] does allow awarding of attorney fees.”
Froble further ruled that everyone who has asked the state for a religious, philosophical or conscientious objection exemption to the state’s vaccination requirements should be considered parties to the case. There should be no difference between religious and philosophical exemptions, he said. During the September hearing, the judge asked parties to submit briefs on their opinions of how the religious freedom bill should apply to philosophical objections.  
All states require students to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases, like measles, chickenpox and polio. West Virginia has been one of only five states in the country that have not allowed nonmedical exemptions to the requirements. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey seeks to change that. In January he issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. His order is based on a 2023 religious freedom law. Morrisey has not rescinded the order, even though state lawmakers earlier this year voted down a bill that would have inscribed the exemption in law. 
The state board of education earlier this year directed county boards not to accept nonmedical exemptions. 
During testimony Wednesday, state Board of Education President Paul Hardesty told the court, among other things, the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act is not part of the laws that govern schools in the state. 
It also heard from state epidemiologist Shannon McBee. McBee said she and her staff developed the nonmedical exemption procedures following Morrisey’s executive order in January. 
McBee said that though the state’s religious freedom law was passed in 2023, the health department did not establish a process for nonmedical exemptions prior to Morrisey’s executive order because “the government has a compelling interest in public health.”
McBee acknowledged that other states and branches of the military have mechanisms to determine if a person seeking a religious exemption has sincerely held religious beliefs. With the governor’s guidance, she said, the state department did not include such a mechanism. The families just have to attest to having a religious objection to vaccines.
The Guzman lawsuit has also been consolidated with one filed against the state health department by two families with school children at higher risk of complications caused by vaccine-preventable illnesses. Plaintiffs in that case are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
The hearing is expected to continue Thursday in Beckley with testimony from Dr. Mark McDaniel, the state’s acting health officer.

(Courtesy of Dan Austin)Landowners forced from their homes five years ago by a sinkhole asked the South Dakota Supreme Court on Wednesday to hold the state accountable.
The Hideaway Hills development in Black Hawk was built atop a former gypsum mine first used more than a century ago on the eastern edge of the Black Hills. For more than 50 years, that work involved a network of underground tunnels. The mine was dormant until the mid-1980s, when the state purchased it to mine gypsum on the land’s surface for use in a Rapid City cement plant the state owned at the time. 
The state reclaimed about 16 acres of mined land, then reseeded it for use as rangeland before selling it in 1994. The man who bought it later sold it to the developers who turned it into Hideaway Hills in the early 2000s. The state maintained subsurface mineral rights to the land in the sale.
South Dakota Supreme Court rules against neighbors in now-moot prison site dispute

Homeowners first reported cracking in their homes’ foundations in 2008, about three years after the Meade County development welcomed its first residents. Twelve years later, a sinkhole yawned open near a cluster of homes, forcing evacuations and spawning a lawsuit.
The plaintiffs, representing 164 properties, say the state put them at risk when it failed to properly backfill the land. They also claim the state reopened tunnels in search of more gypsum, a claim the state denies.
A lower court ruled against the families. The judge agreed with the state, which argued it has immunity from “tort” lawsuits that seek to assign liability and collect monetary damages.
The landowners appealed to the state Supreme Court. They say their claim is not a “tort,” but is rather about a “taking” of their land that was akin to eminent domain. Their “inverse condemnation” claim says the state robbed them of their full property rights by failing to backfill the mine correctly and using the mined material in a cement plant whose proceeds were used for a public purpose. 
Proceeds from the 2001 sale of the cement plant were used to establish a trust whose returns now help fund state government.
Landowners: State stole property rights
Arguments in the case took place Wednesday morning at the University of South Dakota Knudson School of Law in Vermillion.
High court rules in favor of victim, but says Marsy’s Law is not absolute

Matthew Hughes, one of the landowners’ lawyers, said the state had a duty to reclaim and backfill its mined areas with material that would hold up as time passed, rather than with gypsum. That material sank in over time, he said.
“That backfill is under every place that the state mined,” Hughes said, and “all the problems” the homeowners have are related to the reclamation. 
What the homebuilders or real estate agents may or may not have said to homebuyers about the land is immaterial, he argued, because “the sole cause of the subsidence and the collapse is the state’s use of problematic backfill.”
Because the surface land was sold in the public interest, he said, and because the state retained the mining rights to the area beneath it, the state owes the homeowners for their losses.
“That reclamation was undertaken for the purpose of selling the surface for money,” Hughes said.
State: Buyer responsible for issues
Terra Larson, an attorney representing the state, disputed that the state’s actions caused the sinkhole to appear. But she also said it doesn’t matter. 
The landowners have a tort claim, she said, and the state’s immune to those. 
The claim of “taking” by inverse condemnation doesn’t fit, she said. The state constitution says that private land can’t be taken for a public purpose without “just compensation.”
No one took land from the current landowners without just compensation, Larson said. 
“All of the damage that occurred here occurred when the state owned this property,” Larson said, referring to the reclamation. 
“Then, when it sold that property, it sold it for approximately $50,000 less than it had purchased the property for, to people who absolutely knew that the state had mined it for gypsum,” Larson said.
Justice Mark Salter wanted to know about the “contemporaneous” aspect of the landowners’ claim. Does the state have a duty to landowners because it kept the mineral rights to the area below the surface?
“There’s a present day resonance to this,” Salter said.
The land’s 1994 buyers knew about the underground tunnels, Larson said, and the agents who later sold the land “fraudulently concealed” the issue. When a new owner discovers a danger on a property and doesn’t disclose it, Larson said, “the responsibility has shifted to that third party” for lawsuits by subsequent property owners.
Matthew Leerberg, another attorney for the homeowners, said in his rebuttal the state can’t both maintain the right to mine the land far beneath the homes and escape its responsibility to those who built them.
“At some point, hopefully we will be before a jury, and we will get to show that these clients are suffering, that they can’t live in their homes anymore, and that it’s the state’s actions, both in the past and the present, that have caused that,” Leerberg said. 
The court will issue a ruling on the Hideaway Hills case at a later date.

If his nomination is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Hewes would join the commission’s acting chairman, Peter Feldman, who’s currently the lone member of the commission after Trump removed three commissioners appointed during the Joe Biden administration and a fourth commissioner, Republican-appointed, resigned.
The commission is a regulatory agency created by Congress in 1972 “to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with consumer products.” It has jurisdiction over thousands of consumer products “from coffee makers to toys to lawn mowers,” according to its website, although it does not have authority over automobiles, foods, drugs and cosmetics.
Hewes’ nomination came as a surprise to some Washington observers, as Trump in his fiscal 2026 budget proposal had called for eliminating the commission and placing its functions under the Department of Health and Human Services. The proposal called for one person serving as an assistant secretary for consumer product safety. This would require congressional action, but Trump’s firing of three commissioners and the resignation of Republican Douglas Dziak appeared to be a move toward elimination or consolidation without congressional action.
In July, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the reinstatement of the fired Democratic commissioners pending lower court litigation.
If his nomination is approved, Hewes would serve a term through 2031. It remains unclear how the commission would operate without a quorum of three. By statute, the commission can have up to five members, appointed by the president and subject to Senate approval for seven-year terms, with no more than three being of the same political party.
Hewes, in a text message responding to a request for comment on Wednesday, said he was on an airplane and could not immediately talk.
Hewes is a longtime Gulfport real estate and insurance business owner and a songwriter and musician whose songs have appeared in movie soundtracks. He was first elected to the state Senate in 1992 and served until 2012, reaching the second-highest leadership spot in the chamber as president pro tempore in 2008. He ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2011, losing the Republican primary to now-Gov. Tate Reeves.
Hewes was elected Gulfport mayor and served from 2013 to June of 2025, declining to seek another term. He has served as an advisory board member for the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Park Service.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/07032307/IMG_0572.jpg,,,2025-10-08 18:57:02.359985

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)The federal government will seek to exempt itself from more than two dozen federal laws in an effort to build border barriers faster along more than 100 miles of New Mexico’s border with Mexico.
In a Wednesday announcement published in the Federal Register, Department of Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem said the effort to build between Sunland Park to the eastern edge of the state’s bootheel, near Antelope Wells is in effect as of Oct. 8.
“There is presently an acute and immediate need to construct additional physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries,” the order stated.
The order further waives requirements for the construction to follow 27 federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act. This is similar to other waivers to speed up border wall construction projects in Arizona and New Mexico, including Mount Cristo Rey.
Noem recently visited the border at Santa Teresa to deliver news that the administration would paint the barriers black to burn people’s skin and deter crossing. At that event, officials noted that border crossings were down 98% from a high in 2023 of 2,400 people crossing the border to only an average of 39 people apprehended crossing the border region in 2025.
In a statement provided to Source NM, U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) whose district encompasses the state’s southern border, called “securing our border” a top priority. However, he said, “as [Defense] Secretary [Pete] Hegseth acknowledged when I questioned him at a recent committee hearing, a wall simply doesn’t make sense or promote public safety in every case. In those areas, I support utilizing technology like towers, sensors, and aerial systems that are better for the natural environment, wildlife corridors, and public land access; are a better use of taxpayer dollars; and are better for our national security.”
Advocates: Mount Cristo Rey wall will worsen migrant deaths, erosion, habitat loss

Environmental groups said the order would devastate fragile ecosystems, fragment habitat and cut the public out from the process.
Laiken Jordahl, Southwest conservation advocate based in Tucson at the Center for Biological Diversity, told Source NM that for bighorn sheep, cougars and other animals living in the area the habitat fragmentation will be “devestating.”
“I mean, basically, they could show up tomorrow with bulldozers and break ground without consulting any wildlife experts, historical experts, or any of the tribes that have resources in these areas,’ he said. “The waiver gives them just an unbelievable amount of power to inflict as much damage as possible as zero accountability.”

Monte Shaw, the executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said now that Nebraska has a functioning CO2 pipeline, ethanol plants in the state can take advantage of lucrative tax credits from the federal government and sell into the ultra-low carbon ethanol market. 
“Iowa has worn the crown,” Shaw said at a new conference Wednesday. “We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years. Last week, we got knocked off.”

Trailblazer and 45z 
Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline, which is slated to stretch several hundred miles and transport CO2 from ethanol plants in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming to an underground storage site in Wyoming, had its first CO2 shipment Oct. 3. 
The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead sequester liquified carbon dioxide. By sequestering the carbon dioxide created in the process of turning corn into ethanol, the plants are able to lower the “lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions” of the fuel below a certain level, set by the U.S. Department of Energy, that makes the fuel eligible for a per-gallon tax credit. 
These credits, known as 45z, were initiated under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. While the IRA was mostly dismantled by the Trump administration, 45z credits were extended under the Republican led tax cut law, known as the “one big beautiful bill.” 
Shaw said the credits can add about 66 cents per gallon of ethanol, which is a lot for an industry that “usually tries to make a penny or two.” 
Impacts to Iowa
According to IRFA, Iowa produces about 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Shaw said if each of those gallons could take advantage of the credits and add 66 cents per gallon, it would equate to more than $3 billion in added value to the industry annually.

“If Iowa wants to maintain low taxes, if we want to do further property tax reform and things of that nature, then the state needs a strong ag economy,” Shaw said. “Ethanol producers need access to the tools in this state to remain competitive with the plants around us that are moving forward.” 
Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the boost to Iowa ethanol would directly impact corn farmers by increasing demand and potential price for corn, but would also “trickle down” to the state’s economy. 
Farmers have faced several years in a row of high interest rates, high input costs, and low market prices for their crops. Trade wars between the U.S. and the countries where it sells ag commodities and purchases inputs have also added stress to farmers. According to a September survey from the National Corn Growers Association, nearly 50% of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis. 
“The Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,” Kuiper said. “Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.”
Dave Miller, the chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said as corn yields continue to grow, farmers need a market that accounts for an extra 150 million bushels a year through 2050. 
Miller said the low-carbon ethanol market facilitated by carbon sequestration could create the potential for an additional 12 million gallons of ethanol, which he said could be fulfilled by the current farming yield increases. 
“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said. “So there’s a real competitive advantage that’s going to open up for Nebraska farmers compared to Iowa farmers.” 
Seth Harder, CEO of two ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa, said he has seen the things in the industry that Iowa does “really great” but he also sees that the states he operates in are on the edge of a “paradigm shift.”
“As Nebraska sees this influx of funds, we hear plants are talking about not only expanding, but doubling,” Harder said. 
Harder said the demand for ethanol appears to be on the rise with the recent decision from California allowing the sale of a higher blend of ethanol fuel, E-15, and the prospect of more states joining in on the trend. 
Challenges
Shaw said he believes Iowa is on the cusp of a “fairly substantial farm crisis.”
“Nothing will solve this problem until we grow demand or reduce production, and reducing production would be devastating to the economy of Iowa in the Midwest,” he said.
Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. Debate on the topic caused splits among GOP lawmakers during the legislative session and has continued to be a divisive issue in the party.
The Trailblazer pipeline had fewer roadblocks than those that have popped up in Iowa. This is in part because Nebraska does not require state approval for CO2 pipelines, and because much of the pipeline was already built as the natural gas line.
Landowners and environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, that are opposed to CO2 sequestration pipelines call the Summit project a “boondoggle.” Opponents worry about property values and the safety of carbon sequestration pipelines. They have also said sequestering carbon should not qualify as a public use, which a project must have in order to use eminent domain. 
Shaw said it doesn’t matter what someone thinks about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and why it should or shouldn’t be sequestered, because for renewable fuel members, this is a “business decision.”
The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is the most well known carbon sequestration project in Iowa, but Shaw said there are other companies and facilities looking for places in Iowa to sequester carbon, or to otherwise build carbon sequestration pipelines. 
On the nearest horizon, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE located near Council Bluffs, is slated to connect to the Trailblazer pipeline and potentially begin sequestering carbon at the plant in late 2026. 
The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline cannot begin construction in Iowa until it secures permits for storage in North Dakota and for passage through South Dakota, which has become challenging due to the enactment of a restricting law in South Dakota. The company filed to change its permit with the Iowa Utilities Commission to remove the Dakota-specific language, in the event it is able to secure a “​​better solution” for storage and passage. 
Shaw said the “economic consequences” of the development in Nebraska could be a “bump in the road” for Iowa if the state adapts and brings its own carbon sequestration practices online, or it could lead to “production and demand flow from places like Iowa to places like Nebraska.” 
“We’re asking the Iowa Legislature to support President Trump’s energy leadership and to help avert what I personally feel is a pending farm crisis, and to help put Iowa’s economy back on stable ground,” Shaw said.

DemasIn a move that shows the government budget cycle is never truly over, appropriators in the Michigan Senate on Wednesday took their first steps toward instituting the House’s earmark transparency rules into state law.
Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee held a hearing for Senate Bill 596, which would amend Michigan’s Management and Budget Act to set conditions under which earmarks are considered before they are placed in a final budget proposal in either chamber of the Legislature.
The conditions under SB 596 would include the name of the lawmaker introducing the earmark, the total amount requested, the name of the intended recipient and the purpose of the earmark. The request must also include an attestation that no conflict of interest existed between the legislator or the state and the recipient, and that the recipient is not a for-profit entity.
All earmarks in the new regime, if passed, must also not be distributed to a state agency or department, and is only a one-time appropriation in any future budget bill. Any program or request put forward in the governor’s budget recommendations would not qualify for a legislatively directed spending request.
State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and sponsor of the bill, said the new rules continue Michigan lawmakers’ commitment to open government and responsible budgeting.
“Since taking office in 2023 we have taken some pretty important steps to ensure legislators had to put their name next to each and every earmark that they championed on behalf of their communities, establishing a clear, transparent process for the first time,” Anthony said. “This bill builds upon that good work, ensuring that those commitments are made in the light of day, and building an additional time for public review.”

Creating a process to identify which lawmakers introduced what earmarks, and how much they might cost taxpayers, was a key House Republican priority in the 2025-26 budget fight that just wrapped this week with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signing of the spending bills. The House instituted rules this year under Republican control for earmark reform in its chamber, and also built a website to catalogue all earmark requests. The requests were scrutinized before they made the House’s final spending proposal.
Republicans in the lower chamber were adamant that their Senate colleagues do the same before any deal could be negotiated or finalized. The Senate eventually caved, but the disclosure of the Senate’s earmarks did not occur until Thursday, Oct. 2, one day after lawmakers passed a continuation budget because they could not finalize a deal before the beginning of the new fiscal year. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee held a meeting that evening where it finally detailed all of its earmarks and what would appear in the budget – a win for Republicans who were pushing for the reforms.
On Wednesday, Anthony opened up the bill to discussion to see what improvements could be made on the Senate’s version, which aimed to slate those rules into state law.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sen. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield) said given the fight the Legislature just went through, one issue she saw in the process occurring on the House side dealt with the public identification of lawmakers’ requests.
“There were times where legislators were harassed because they didn’t put things on the list, or because they did,” Bayer said. “They had a hard time from folks. Sometimes you need a little protection as you talk to people, when they request things. We get way more requests than we’re ever going to be able to fulfill.”
Bayer added that maybe not publishing everything, except for items that will definitely be in the final budget, was a good idea.
Anthony said that was certainly something to consider.
“I know that in my Senate district, we get lots of local requests. We have a mix of urban, rural, suburban requests,” Anthony said. “And because of the limited state funds that we have, there’s a lot of folks who are disappointed, and oftentimes, they want to see me as their senator fighting for everything. So, I do think it’s a balance, but it’s something that we can contemplate throughout this process.”
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), said that some early version of the proposed process played out on the final day of the chambers’ budget action, and wanted to know what lawmakers could expect.
Anthony said their colleagues in the House, which jumpstarted the process, and the executive office are all interested in finding out how they can share a more transparent earmarks process with additional rules and conditions, and that the Senate’s version might even include more disclosures in a final version.
“The House may have its own spin, so ideally, we would have a shared set of disclosure that we would all make sure are contemplated and then how we do it, the flavor that the Senate does it versus the House, I think ultimately it’s up to this body,” Anthony said. “But I think the goal stays the same … making sure that the public, the press, anyone who is interested in knowing where their dollars are going, that we’re doing that earlier, and there’s a structured process, and it is accessible to the public.”
The committee did not move the bill forward and will likely be subject to further discussion at a future meeting.

A recently retired, longtime FAA inspector who has worked the Fiesta for 29 years said an ongoing federal government shutdown will likely result in fewer government safety inspectors. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The ongoing federal government shutdown means half the typical number of federal safety inspectors are on the field during the world’s biggest hot air balloon rally taking place in Albuquerque this week, according to a Fiesta spokesperson and a retired federal aviation official. 
James Malarsie retired earlier this year in Albuquerque after nearly 30 years as an inspector for the Federal Aviation Administration, and worked the Fiesta with the FAA every year since 1995. That meant approving balloonist applications, doing equipment spot checks and roaming the launchfield with a team to search for blatant safety violations, among other duties.
He’s experienced several threatened, partial or full shutdowns during his long career, he told Source New Mexico on Wednesday. If this year’s ongoing federal government shutdown is anything like the one in 2013, the FAA will scrap certain tasks like in-depth crash investigations, last-minute pilot certifications and safety inspections outside the launchfield. 
Trump floats plan to deny back pay to furloughed federal workers after shutdown

In years when the federal government is functional, 12 FAA inspectors are on the ground at the Fiesta each day, according to Malarsie and Tom Garrity, a Fiesta spokesperson. Six inspectors are on the ground during the Fiesta this year, Garrity told Source on Wednesday afternoon. 
One typical duty for the inspectors is to divide the launchpad each day into a grid, Malarsie said. Inspectors then claim a square on the grid and fan out to see balloon crews are making safety errors. Some of the hazards FAA inspectors key in on are whether balloons are tethered to trucks during static displays; if a person is safely manning the dangerous inflation fans; and ensuring no one is smoking cigarettes at an event that runs on highly explosive propane. 
“This year, it’s going to be pretty sparsened,” he said of the FAA inspections. “They’re going to look at it as, ‘What is the minimum we can get away with?’”
Still, Malarsie emphasized that Fiesta-goers should be confident about safety this year, despite the shutdown and mass furloughs of federal aviation employees. He said the Fiesta administrators and pilots themselves take safety seriously, and he described the FAA’s role as important but not the first line of defense in keeping the public and passengers safe.

“It’s not like the FAA is the magic component to make it work. We’re like a speed camera on the side of the road. We do our best to catch the flagrant,” he said. “For the most part, the balloonists are willing and able” to keep themselves, their passengers and the public safe. 
The FAA did not respond to Source’s request for comment about the potential impacts of the shutdown on the Fiesta. According to an auto-reply email, administration is unable to respond to news media requests due to the shutdown,  and the FAA office in Albuquerque is unstaffed, according to a pre-recorded voicemail message.
Tom Garrity also told Source the decreased number of inspectors won’t influence  the event’s safety.
The biggest impact of the reduction is on “ramp checks,” Garrity said, which the FAA inspectors and Fiesta officials conduct each year to ensure pilots have the necessary documents to fly, such as safety inspections, federal airworthiness certificates, medical clearances and other necessary approvals.
“If you and I were going to a checkpoint, they would be asking for a driver’s license. Can I see your insurance?” he said. “That would be the equivalent.”
Fiesta officials have all the necessary training to do the checks without the FAA, Garrity said. So he thinks they’re still being conducted sufficiently to ensure pilots are safe to fly.

“Safety is the first and foremost priority for Balloon Fiesta,” he said. 
Because the Fiesta occurs each year in early October, it sometimes coincides with threatened or real shutdowns, Malarsie said. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and carries a deadline for Congress to pass a spending package to fund the government.
In 2013, the last time the government fully shut down in October, no FAA inspectors were on the field, he said. While Malarsie recalls that the event went off without a hitch, he said the federal Transportation Department in subsequent years developed a better plan to ensure the most vital FAA functions remain unaltered if a shutdown and the Fiesta coincide. 
“As time progressed and the agency got more used to dealing with the politics of a shutdown, it kind of made a determination of what was ‘essential,’” he said. 
That means, in 2025, a “small cadre of inspectors” flew in from another FAA field offices, likely from Lubbock, Texas, he said, based on a recent conversation with a current FAA official. They’re here to shore up a short-staffed local field office and will be dedicated solely to “safety oversight.”
“All they’re doing is direct surveillance of the event,” he said. 
Also, in typical years, the FAA is sometimes the first on the scene to investigate hot air balloon crashes, because the National Transportation Safety Board delegates some investigatory steps to the FAA. But during other shutdowns, Malarsie recalls investigations being delayed because the FAA could not immediately start examining the causes of crashes. 
Two hot air balloons have struck powerlines during the Fiesta this year, according to media reports, though no one was injured. 
Malarsie abruptly retired early this year just shy of his 30th Fiesta, he said, due to a conflict over whether he’d be granted time to go on a “once-in-a-lifetime” oryx hunt in White Sands. But he said he misses being at what would have been his 30th Fiesta. He’s quoted in an FAA article about the Fiesta last year:

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)If we were a village of 100 instead of a nation of 340 million, I wonder if the perceptions would be different.
Would there be wide support for a village economy in which one person (or 1%) possessed more resources and materials than the 50 villagers with the least, combined?
Would it seem fair that 10 “elite” villagers, living high on their hill, held two-thirds of all of the village’s wealth — the total stores of food, building materials, textiles, etc. — while the other 90 battled and scraped among each other for the remaining third?
Would it make any sense that a majority of those lower 90, rather than questioning why the 10 at the top had so much, instead became angry that the 10 at the bottom were asking for anything at all?
What would we make of a village council chosen to serve the best interests of all 100 but whose members consistently, albeit quietly, made decisions favoring the 10 at the top because that is who paid their way?
And, would we be skeptical of the motivations of the nine elites and one super-elite, and the village council they bought, if they made it clear that they would rather watch the village destroy itself than allow even a little bit more to be provided for the many?
In our village of New Hampshire, the biggest challenge we face is not whatever the current ruling party targets as “woke” on a given day. It is our system for funding public education, which is too reliant on property taxes. Because neither Democrats nor Republicans have done anything to fix the actual problem, all that’s left politically is to engage in skirmishes around the periphery of that fundamental problem.
So instead of solutions we get: Teachers are overpaid. There’s administrative bloat. Vouchers will solve everything. They’re brainwashing our kids. There’s smut in the libraries. On and on, as if any of it went within a million miles of the heart of the matter.
New Hampshire needs an income tax in which 100% of the revenue it collects is dedicated to educating our kids and providing universal child care, with a correlating reduction in property taxes. Not a heavier tax burden, but a different one. A fairer one, at long last. No more rich towns, no more poor towns when it comes to giving our kids a future. There would still be haves and have nots — a Bedford would still be able to provide more public services than a Claremont as a property-rich community — but no longer would kids be penalized for the ZIP code in which they were born and raised.
And no longer would school district meetings play out like “Lord of the Flies.”
I know, I know. Fat chance. New Hampshire has built its very identity on the idea that our aversion to progressive taxation is what makes us special. And we, the 90 villagers, have been taught to believe it — even as we lose our homes and watch our community schools disintegrate before our eyes.
Meanwhile, the top challenge for the nation is not, despite the claims of our leaders, the “leftist” political rallies in Portland, Oregon, but health care costs. In fact, it’s the reason why the federal government has shut down and seems likely to stay that way for a while. 
What we need is Medicare for All, a system in which the multiple payers of our current system (health insurers, employers, and the government) are replaced by a single payer (the government). It’s exactly the kind of thing a Department of Government Efficiency would propose if that department was truly interested in efficiency and/or the well-being of the people for whom the government works.
“On average, other large, wealthy countries spend about half as much per person on health as the U.S.,” according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker.
If such high per-person spending on health was actually serving the people, you would expect that the United States would be at the top of the list when it comes to “life expectancy at birth” but we aren’t even in the top 40, the World Health Organization reports. The global ranking for “healthy” life expectancy — or the average number of years someone can expect to live in good health — is even worse for the U.S., which is outside of the top 70 nations in that statistic.
All the while, more than 25 million people are without health insurance, the majority citing the expense of it, and another 17 million are expected to join them in the wake of the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
So where is the $4.9 trillion a year (as of 2023) in “national health expenditures” going if not to better health outcomes and access? Follow the money to the Fortune 500 — always follow the money.
I’ve heard all of the arguments against an income tax here in New Hampshire and Medicare for All in the United States, year after year after year. I’ve seen their statistics and listened to their catastrophizing. I’ve been told how the ultra-wealthy already pay more than their fair share, despite the fact that economic inequality continues to rise at an alarming rate. I’m aware that “taxation is theft” is something that a lot of people in this state — especially that squad of new arrivals — actually believe.
But this is what I really hear from those who make such arguments: “I want all of the benefits of living in society — from paved roads to public education to just being around other people — but none of the personal investment.” It is selfishness created in part by the inequity of the system itself, in which the masses are competing for a too-small piece of the overall pie.
We live in a land where a handful of villagers have so much more than they could ever need, and yet our laws are designed to make sure they have every advantage when it comes to maintaining that wealth and growing it, for themselves and their heirs. That is the point of the tax cuts that translate into reductions in services for the rest, and why the elites and their surrogates on the village council spend so much time savaging the poor and the powerless.
What will it take, I wonder, for the 90 to stop fighting among themselves long enough to start asking the right questions of the 10 and their council?",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/domevillage-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-10-08 17:58:08.081933

(United States District Court)A Salt Lake City man faces federal charges of attempted arson and possession of a destructive device after investigators say he placed a gas can underneath a FOX 13 news vehicle and lit a fuse that ran into it.
Christopher Solomon Proctor, 45, was indicted Sept. 30 in Salt Lake City’s U.S. District Court, with the complaint unsealed earlier this month, court records show. Proctor is in custody in Salt Lake County Jail; his attorney did not respond to a request for comment.
According to the indictment, security footage captured a person dressed in dark clothing and possibly a mask setting the gas can under the rear bumper of the parked news vehicle at about 4:10 a.m. on Sept. 12, trailing out a long fuse, and lighting it before hurrying away. The fuse burned for almost five minutes before going out without igniting the gas can. 
Of the three DNA profiles found on the gas can, DNA on the can’s ring was matched to Proctor through Utah’s State DNA Index System database, according to the indictment. Court documents do not say who the additional profiles belong to or whether they were identified.
An acquaintance of Proctor told investigators that Proctor told him he had set a destructive device and lit the fuse under a “fox news” vehicle but that it didn’t detonate, the indictment states. 
The security footage showed that the person who left the gas can wore distinctive split-toe boots, investigators wrote. Online purchase records showed Proctor purchased “Ace Martial Arts Supply Ninja Tabi Boots, Black Jikatabi (Outdoor Tabi)” online in August, along with flame-resistant gloves, the indictment says.
Those boots and gloves were found when investigators searched Proctor’s home, according to the indictment, along with a small gas can with a hole drilled in the lid and a multicolored fuse similar to the one found at the scene.

Law enforcement last month announced they had arrested two other men, Adeeb Nasir, 58, and Adil Justice Ahmed Nasir, 31, in connection with a search warrant served at their Magna home as part of the investigation into the explosive device left under the news vehicle. They are not mentioned in the federal charges against Proctor.
Adeeb Nasir and Adil Nasir each face two counts in Utah’s 3rd District Court of manufacturing, possessing, selling or using a weapon of mass destruction, second-degree felonies, after investigators said they found fake dynamite while searching their home, and the men allegedly told them it was real.

HANOVER — High fire danger in the Upper Valley has prompted Dartmouth College to alter its plans for the annual homecoming bonfire while fire crews remain on high alert.
The college announced Friday that instead of a homecoming weekend bonfire, there will be an “interactive light and laser show set to a soundtrack performed by Dartmouth student DJs.”
First-year students will also be given light-up wristbands that are aligned with the soundtrack, according to the announcement.
“While the bonfire itself cannot take place, the essence of the tradition — community, class unity, and celebration — remains central to our planning,” EJ Kiefer, executive director of conferences and events at Dartmouth and a member of the homecoming bonfire committee, said in a news release.
The massive Friday night bonfire is traditionally a highlight of Dartmouth’s homecoming weekend, but this year, outdoor fires big and small are prohibited in New Hampshire and Vermont amid extreme drought and unusually high fire danger.
Both states have banned all outdoor burning until further notice.
Fire crews were on especially high alert Monday as dry air and breezy conditions further elevated the fire danger, according to a special weather statement from the National Weather Service office that covers all of New Hampshire. The risk was expected to lessen as humidity rose and winds died down Monday evening.
In the Upper Valley, fire crews in Grafton and Springfield, N.H., responded to a report of smoke Saturday and found an illegal bonfire in Grafton, according to a post from the Springfield Fire Department.
Outside of the Upper Valley, brush fires took a more dangerous route.
A firefighting helicopter stationed at the Lebanon Municipal Airport was dispatched Saturday to assist crews battling a fire on Brownell Mountain in Williston throughout the weekend. The fire covered about one acre when a crew from Williston Fire Department responded Saturday afternoon, according to a Facebook post from the department.
Crews sought the assistance of the helicopter because steep terrain and “waning daylight” made the fire difficult to access on foot.
The drought continues to have other impacts as well.
Due to unusually low lake levels, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, which manages dams across the state, has been drawing water down from Grafton Pond in Grafton through Crystal Lake in Enfield, and into Mascoma Lake, which serves as the drinking water supply for Lebanon.
As of last week, the department had to stop drawing water out of Grafton Pond because “there really wasn’t much more water to give,” while Crystal Lake and Mascoma Lake have returned to near-normal levels, NH DES Dam Bureau Chief Engineer Corey Clark said Monday.
“Our hope is that we have a normal winter and we can refill those lakes back to the normal recreational levels next spring,” Clark said.

Feds postpone Wyoming coal sale despite promise to ""revitalize"" the industry. Critics say even the coal industry isn't betting big on its future.
The post Trump’s major coal sales flop in Wyoming and Montana appeared first on WyoFile .","Federal officials indefinitely postponed a Wyoming coal lease sale scheduled for Wednesday, apparently in response to what many observers consider a lowball bid on another federal coal lease on Monday in Montana.
Navajo Transitional Energy Company, the only bidder, stunned coal market watchers with an offer of $186,000 for 167 million tons of federal coal associated with its Spring Creek mine in southeast Montana — a fraction of a penny per ton and woefully low compared to past federal coal lease sales in the region. The last such major sale in the region, in 2012, netted $793 million for 721 million tons, or about $1.10 per ton, according to federal data.
Navajo Transitional was also in the queue to bid on the 441 million-ton West Antelope III federal coal lease associated with its Antelope coal mine spanning Campbell and Converse counties in Wyoming. 
Bureau of Land Management and Interior Department officials are still reviewing the Spring Creek bid, and those close to the process expect that another date will be set for the West Antelope III coal lease sale.

“While we would have liked to see stronger participation, this sale reflects the lingering impact from Obama and Biden’s decades long war on coal which aggressively sought to end all domestic coal production and erode confidence in the U.S. coal industry,” the Interior wrote in an email responding to a WyoFile inquiry. “Fortunately, President [Donald] Trump and his administration are rebuilding trust between industry and government as part of our broader effort to restore American Energy Dominance.”
But others say market forces — including cheap natural gas and increasingly efficient wind and solar energy — are bigger factors. 
Others note that the coal industry itself sees the writing on the wall. If a fraction-of-a-penny bid is any indication, some critics say, the thermal coal industry — which relies on U.S. coal-burning power plants — isn’t yet confident that Trump’s policies will turn around years of market decline.
“It tells you that there’s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it’s not worth very much money,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis Energy Data Analyst Seth Feaster told WyoFile on Wednesday. “It points to the fundamental, structural decline the coal industry is facing — for thermal coal — and that story hasn’t been reversed, despite all the things that they’re talking about.”

The postponement in Wyoming and lackluster offer in Montana come just days after the Trump administration touted sweeping regulatory rollbacks and $625 million in federal spending to revitalize “clean, beautiful coal.” 
Navajo Transitional tried to set expectations regarding Powder River Basin coal’s market value back in September, urging the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to set its minimum bid requirement for the West Antelope III coal lease much lower than comparable leases in the past. Neighboring Powder River Basin coal operator, CORE Natural Resources, echoed that sentiment and told BLM officials, “the fair-market value of coal in the Powder River Basin will remain soft for the next number of years.”
Gov. Mark Gordon has said recently that Trump’s efforts to revive the coal industry will take some time to bear fruit. He has also underscored the administration’s notion that expanding the coal industry is necessary to meet increasing electricity demand, mostly driven by artificial intelligence and other computational facilities.
The Wyoming Mining Association declined to comment on Navajo Transitional’s Spring Creek coal lease bid, but acknowledged the industry still must reckon with 15 years of drastic market and policy shifts.
“It tells you that there’s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it’s not worth very much money.”Seth Feaster, energy industry analyst
“As we’ve not seen a lease sale in over a decade, there may be a bit of a learning curve between the agency and industry to determine value given the current market conditions, projected demand and the shift in public policy,” Mining Association Executive Director Travis Deti said.
Regardless of what coal bidders and federal officials ultimately decide is the “fair market value” for Powder River Basin coal, Deti said, it’s vital to resume leasing new tracts of coal.
“If you don’t have the coal leased, you can’t mine it and you don’t have the jobs,” Deti said.
Conservation groups have noted that existing coal leases allow mining in the region to continue at pace through 2041. 
There’s a danger in the Trump administration’s narrative around coal making a comeback, particularly for coal-reliant communities, according to Mijin Cha, who grew up in Laramie and studies energy transition and social justice strategies. 
“It creates false hope and increased distrust between community members and government officials — you know, the folks that actually could help them,” said Cha, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It delays help for energy communities, and I think that what they’re doing [selling more federal coal] is so much more detrimental.”
Though the industry has seen slight upticks in demand recently, Wyoming coal production — primarily in the Powder River Basin — has shrunk by more than half since its heyday in the mid-2000s. The state scooped about 191 million tons of coal last year, according to federal data.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday about whether the state should end the practice of billing low-income Iowans for their court-appointed attorneys in cases where charges are dismissed.
In 2024, four separate theft charges against Ronald Pagliai were resolved through a plea agreement, in which Pagliai pleaded guilty in two cases while the court dismissed the other two. In addition to being sentenced to serve 41 days, Pagliai was also ordered by the district court to pay victim restitution and court costs associated with all four cases.
Pagliai’s case before the state Supreme Court challenges the order to pay for court costs for the two cases that were dismissed, arguing Iowa Code asserts defendants who receive legal assistance are only required to pay court costs in cases of convictions or acquittals.
The case is a way for organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, Fines and Fees Justice Center, and Public Justice to challenge the state’s ability to steeply charge Iowans, who are given indigent legal defense because they cannot afford their own lawyer, as required by the Constitution.
While the right to counsel is guaranteed by the Constitution, states are still allowed to attempt to recoup costs by charging court fees in these cases, and a majority of states do so. But according to reporting from the Marshall Project, Iowa imposes higher fees than most other states — and these debts are rarely paid.
Iowa’s practice of charging low-income people for public defenders in cases that are dropped or where they are acquitted is also unlike many other states. This is the practice being challenged in Pagliai’s case, Alex Kornya, cooperating attorney with the ACLU of Iowa said. Kornya told reporters Wednesday the “lion’s share” of court debt in Iowa comes from costs assessed against low-income people to repay the state for their legal defense.
Iowa also stands out for charging “actual cost” of an attorney to the defendant, Kornya said, while other states often have statutes limiting how much the state can recoup on the cost of court-appointed defense.
Kornya said it was also “unusual” that Iowa assesses these debts against people even if they win their case. He also referenced the 2020 case State of Iowa vs. Lori Mathes, a similar situation where prosecutors dismissed a marijuana possession charge against Mathes in Monona County, with an order that she pay county sheriff fees, court-appointed attorney fees, and restitution. Mathes said she understood the bill to be $500 for court costs, but the amount she was expected to reimburse was nearly $3,000.
The Iowa Supreme Court ruled 4-4 in the Mathes case in 2020, with Justice Matthew McDermott recusing himself from the ruling. This stalemate declared the case “affirmed by operation of law,” meaning the state law allowing district courts to impose debt in criminal cases when charges were dismissed was allowed to remain in place.
Kornya said Iowa’s system of imposing these fees in cases where charges are dismissed is also more costly to low-income people than in cases where they are convicted of a crime.
“One of the things that we found to be, I think, particularly perverse about the assessment of these debts in dismissed cases is that — at least for convictions and acquittal — that people have a right to reduce the amount they owe based on their ability to pay,” Kornya siad. “When someone has a dismissed case, they bypass that ability to pay determination. So it’s not even as simple as saying that people who have dismissed cases are in the same position as someone who is convicted. They’re actually in a worse position, and often end up owing more for their case than they would have if they had been convicted, which makes no sense.”
The Pagliai case brought this subject before the Iowa Supreme Court again. Assistant Attorney General David Banta, who represented the state of Iowa in the case, argued that because Pagliai had agreed to pay for the costs of the dismissed charges through a plea agreement, he had waived his ability to challenge the district court’s authority on setting these costs.
But the state conceded in its Appellee Brief, “while the State maintains the district court had jurisdiction over Pagliai’s criminal cases, it agrees that it did not have statutory authority to order Pagalia to pay costs for dismissed charges,” but that Pagliai had allowed this authority to be put in place through the plea agreement.
Allowing Pagliai’s challenge to move forward would “affect how plea deals are made in the future,” Banta said.

“We have a runway with our current federal funding for all of October, probably early November,” Edney said. “And the shutdown better be over by then.”
This comes a day after state Health Department spokesperson Greg Flynn said if benefits for the Women, Infants and Children program (WIC) program dried up this month, the department would have to look at ways to “shore things up” with state funds. 
These funds make vital services possible for tens of thousands of households statewide, offering breastfeeding support and monthly vouchers for healthy foods to women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum, as well as infants and children under the age of five. Roughly 300 WIC-approved grocery stores and pharmacies allow members to use their benefits. 
To stretch federal dollars further, the state Health Department will limit new applicants, Edney said. He added that this could help keep the program afloat for a few weeks. He also said he hopes the use of state funds will not be necessary. 
During the government shutdown, new applicants will only be approved if they fall under “Priority 1” designation, which includes pregnant and breastfeeding women and high-risk infants. However, according to Flynn on Tuesday, officials will not require proof of pregnancy, breastfeeding or a high-risk infant to determine priority status, allowing people to get the help they need while it lasts. 
“Priority 1” applicants will still need to follow the guidelines for approval, including bringing proof of income, residence and identification to their initial WIC appointment. More information about the application process can be found on the state Health Department’s website.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Deborah Yetter)LOUISVILLE — Just three months into the job, Brian Yearwood, the new superintendent of Jefferson County Public Schools, met a receptive audience at the Louisville Forum where he outlined his plans to improve Kentucky’s largest school system.
During an hour-long luncheon of the nonpartisan public interest group, Yearwood touched on a wide range of issues facing JCPS — a looming budget deficit, charter schools, safety and a controversial proposal to split up the district.
But he returned repeatedly to his primary theme: improving student academic achievement in a district of more than 94,000 students where low performance is of ongoing concern.
His goal?

“To make sure that every child in our district is reading at or above grade level when they graduate from our schools,” Yearwood said to a burst of applause.
He acknowledged the current projected budget shortfall of $180 million is a major concern, blaming it largely on the loss of extra federal funds during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The one thing we did not plan for is when the funds ended,” he said.
“That’s very serious and we are taking it seriously,” Yearwood added. “I promise we will fix it.”
But the district will address the shortfall by reducing spending in administration and other savings — not by cutting salaries of teachers or instructional aides in the classroom, he said.
“We will not balance the budget by shortchanging our children,” he said. “Our children deserve a safe learning environment, and we will protect that.”
That promise drew applause from Maddie Shepard, president of the Jefferson County Teachers Association, who said Yearwood has made that pledge repeatedly.
“He says that every chance he gets in public,” she said.
A survey obtained by Louisville Public Media earlier this year showed Yearwood was not the first choice among teachers and the community to replace outgoing Superintendent Marty Pollio. But Shepard said the teachers’ union has been impressed by Yearwood’s accessibility and willingness to listen.
“We have a very collaborative relationship so far,” Shephard said.
In opening comments, Yearwood introduced himself as a native of Trinidad who left the West Indies island at 17 to further his education in the United States.
“By the way, I am legal,” he said, prompting laughter over the apparent reference to  the recent arrest of the Des Moines, Iowa, school superintendent by immigration officials who said he is not authorized to work in the United States.
“I have papers,” Yearwood added.
Yearwood holds a doctorate, a master’s degree and a bachelor’s degree in educational studies from Texas Tech University. Most recently, he served as superintendent of Columbia Public Schools in Missouri, where he was credited with overseeing substantial academic improvement.
Among questions he addressed Wednesday at the Louisville Forum:
Splitting up JCPS 
Critics including Rep. Jason Nemes, a Louisville Republican, have proposed splitting JCPS into smaller districts.
“What does that mean when you talk about splitting JCPS up?” Yearwood asked. “I believe that under my leadership, we can show them JCPS can be successful without an intervention.”
As for potential legislative action, Yearwood said he has met with Nemes and said the lawmaker “has promised me a grace period for the upcoming session. I appreciate that.”
Audit
“I look forward to that,” Yearwood said of a pending audit of the school system by Republican state Auditor Allison Ball. “I’m sure they’ll find some positives and I’m sure they’ll find some negatives.” An audit, he added, would identify areas to improve.
Charter schools
Whether a charter school law  enacted by the legislature is allowed under Kentucky’s Constitution is currently before the state Supreme Court.
“My hope is that charter schools, if allowed, will be under the same rules and regulations as public schools,” Yearwood said. “In public schools we have to accept all students, have to have certified teachers in the classrooms. If that were to come to fruition, I hope we would all be playing on the same fields.”
 Behavior and discipline

Yearwood said JCPS can’t solve such problems by simply expelling students. Rather, it needs to find a way to reach them and help them learn through alternative schools or other means.
“We can’t just put them out,” he said. “We cannot stop a child’s education because of the behavior. We need to keep educating them.”
Moral instruction
Giving students an optional hour each week of public school time for Bible study at an off-campus site is under consideration in school districts across the state after the legislature changed a law earlier this year. An Ohio Christian education group, LifeWise Academy, is organizing across the state. Residents of other districts, including JCPS, have also shown an interest in introducing the program, according to the Courier Journal.
“I’m a man of faith and I believe we need to respect individuals within our schools,” Yearwood said. “We should respect individual beliefs within our schools.”
Student achievement
Yearwood concluded his remarks by returning to his goal of improving student achievement scores, a goal he said he will try to reach by studying data and better understanding where students need improvement.
“That is the plan,” he said.
JCPS Board chairman Corrie Shull, who attended the forum, said he believes Yearwood can handle the many challenges facing him.
“He certainly has a tremendous task,” Shull said. “I think he’s definitely up for the task.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yearwood-2-scaled-e1759960101232-1024x712.jpg,,,2025-10-08 17:58:08.081933

Gabe Vasquez lead an Oct. 8, 2025 to Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson urging action to pay military during shutdown. (Leah Romero for Source NM)On the eighth day of the federal government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a New Mexico Democrat representing the state’s southern 2nd Congressional District, led a letter to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) highlighting the looming threat of missed paychecks for military personnel.
The letter, co-led by U.S. Rep. Derek Tran (D-CA) and co-signed by 75 other House Democrats, notes that if Congress doesn’t act by Oct. 15, “nearly three million military families will miss their next paycheck. That’s unacceptable — our military families and troops deserve better.” That includes 22,000 active duty and reserve personnel in New Mexico, according to a news release from Vasquez’s office.
In a statement, Vasquez said that the country’s “troops selflessly serve and defend our country every single day, and they deserve to be paid on time for their work. I’m calling on Speaker Johnson to do what’s right for our military families and get Republicans back to Washington to vote to pay our servicemen and women. There’s no excuse for inaction, because when it comes to paying our troops, there is no room for partisan politics.”
The bipartisan Pay Our Troops Act would ensure services members, along with civilian employees and contractors, receive pay during the shutdown. Vasquez’s letter notes that that Congress passed a similar bill during the 2013 shutdown. Doing so, the letter says, shows “Congress can come together for the benefit of our service members even while disagreeing on other matters.”
Johnson, however, on Wednesday rejected voting on a stand-alone bill to provide paychecks to active duty military members during the shutdown, and said if Democrats want to ensure salaries for federal workers, they should vote to advance the stopgap spending bill. 
“They live with that vote. They made that decision. The House is done,” Johnson said at a morning press conference. “The ball is now in the Senate’s court. It does us no good to be here dithering on show votes. We did it. We sent the product over.”
President Donald Trump, however, in comments from the White House later in the day, indicated he supported a stand-alone bill to provide pay for military members during the shutdown, saying: “Yeah, that probably will happen.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vasquez-1024x683.png,,,2025-10-08 17:58:08.081933

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)EDMOND — Leaders of the state’s third-largest university have engaged in “egregiously anti-free speech conduct” in an effort to control media coverage by ending print operations of the student newspaper, according to a letter a journalism legal group sent to school administrators this week.
The University of Central Oklahoma’s decision to stop printing the school’s student newspaper, The Vista, for the first time in 122 years amounts to a clear act of retaliation in response to “rigorous news coverage of university affairs,” according to the letter sent by Leslie Briggs, an attorney with Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The group said it is representing six current or former UCO students.
In August, a UCO student media advisory board voted to end printing physical copies of The Vista, and said it would continue publishing digitally like many campuses and other newspapers have in recent years.
While not constitutionally required to fund a print publication, the decision to stop printing The Vista comes after UCO administrators “repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with editorial decisions” made by The Vista, including coverage that “may reflect poorly” on the university and President Todd Lamb’s administration, according to the letter. 
Briggs wrote that despite claims from the UCO administration that the decision to stop printing The Vista was made to cut costs, university leadership has subsequently refused to accept private donations that would pay for the estimated $12,000 annual cost to print the newspaper for another year.
“Any possible notion that UCO’s decision was animated even slightly by concerns over budget is firmly negated by the fact that UCO refused to allow The Vista to accept outside funding to allow continued publication,” according to the letter. “That is not cost-saving – it’s censorship.”
Briggs’ letter was addressed to five university employees, including Lamb and Elizabeth Maier, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Lamb and Maier deferred comment to Adrienne Nobles, a spokesperson for the university. 
Nobles said in an email to Oklahoma Voice that officials had received the letter and will respond to Briggs in the coming days.
“The Vista remains an independent publication in its new digital format with editorial agency over their content,” Nobles said in a statement, adding that the publication’s student editor is among those who support the transition to digital-only.
She said many college newspapers have made the shift to fully digital prior to The Vista, including The Maneater at the University of Missouri, The Daily Gamecock at the University of South Carolina and the OU Daily at the University of Oklahoma. Nobles also cited The Daily Illini at The University of Illinois as having made the shift to fully digital, though the publication’s website says it is still distributed in print.
Briggs’ clients are demanding that the university restore editorial independence to the paper, allow it to resume printing, return The Vista’s newspaper distribution racks to campus, cease all efforts to retaliate against students for exercising their First Amendment rights and discontinue efforts to “censor content the University deems objectionable.”
In an interview with Oklahoma Voice, Briggs said that her hope is that the letter will open a dialogue with the university “so that they can actually sit down and hear concerns of these journalists and come to a mutually agreeable solution.”
“The current status of what’s going on with The Vista is unacceptable,” she said.

The Louisiana Republican has denied that accusation.Grijalva has vowed to be the 218th and final signature needed on a bipartisan petition to force a vote on the measure.Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona led his Democratic colleagues in trying to gain recognition on the House floor to get Grijalva sworn in Wednesday. But GOP Rep. Russ Fulcher of Idaho, presiding over the House during its pro forma session, quickly gaveled out and did not recognize the Democrats. Several Democratic House leaders joined Stanton on the floor, including Minority Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the chair and vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, Pete Aguilar and Ted Lieu of California, and Arizona’s Rep. Yassamin Ansari, the Democratic freshman class president. “That’s undemocratic,” Stanton shouted after the group failed to be recognized. The attempt followed a similar failed effort by Rep. Jim McGovern to be recognized in the House during its Monday pro forma session.Johnson blames shutdownJohnson has received flak from Democrats for having sworn in two of his own party’s members during pro forma sessions earlier this year, including Reps. Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine of Florida. “Speaker Johnson needs to stop dragging his feet and follow the same precedent he set in swearing in his Republican colleagues earlier this year,” Grijalva said in a statement.“If he would simply give me a date and time, I will be there,” she said. Wednesday marked the eighth day of the government shutdown, as dueling GOP and Democratic stopgap bills in the Senate failed to advance yet again.“We will swear in Rep.-Elect Grijalva as soon as the House returns to Session when Chuck Schumer, Mark Kelly and (Ruben) Gallego decide to open up the Government,” a spokesperson for Johnson’s office said Wednesday prior to Democrats’ latest attempt, referencing the respective Senate minority leader from New York and Arizona’s two Democratic senators. “It is custom practice in the House to swear in members when the chamber is in session,” the spokesperson said. A day prior, Johnson had told reporters “we will swear her in when everybody gets back, it’s a ceremonial duty,” adding: “Look, we’ll schedule it, I guess, as soon as she wants.”",,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Republican Jonathan Bush launches bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday October 8, 2025 4:49 pm





Jonathan Bush, nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush, officially launched his campaign for governor on Wednesday, running as a Republican to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills in the 2026 election.
Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.
In a launch video, Bush outlined some of the changes he hopes to make as governor, including auditing the government, investing in trade schools and jumpstarting the economy “by getting rid of silly regulations.”
“To change things, I’m going to have to break a few eggs along the way,” he said in the video.

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” said Jackson, a fifth-generation logger from Allagash. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Sanders, an independent who ran twice for the Democratic nomination for president, endorsed both Jackson and Platner in their respective races.

By: Lauren McCauley - Friday August 15, 2025 2:53 pm





Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.

“To change things, I’m going to have to break a few eggs along the way,” he said in the video.
Bush moved to Cape Elizabeth in recent years, though he grew up spending his summers on North Haven.
This summer, Bush launched Maine for Keeps, a podcast and advocacy group that he has described as a “solutions factory” aimed at improving the state’s business environment.

“Mainers want a leader who will shake up the status quo in Augusta. They want a proven job creator who will make sure our kids don’t have to leave the state to achieve the American Dream,” Bush said in a statement ahead of the announcement. 
Bush started his business career with the founding of health care billing and software company athenahealth in 1997. Just over 20 years later, Bush was ousted amid the company’s sale to a private hedge fund after reports of physical altercations with his ex-wife were made public. Bush later founded Boston-based health data platform company Zus, where he currently serves as CEO.
Bush is entering an already crowded race with more than a half dozen Republican candidates who will compete in the June 6 primary, which will determine who will be nominated for the November 2026 ballot. 
The Republican primary has so far not drawn any candidate who can match the political experience or name recognition as the Democratic side, which includes former legislative leaders and children of two of Maine’s sitting members of Congress. 
In a statement Wednesday, Maine Democratic Party Chair Charlie Dingman said, “We don’t need a governor who thinks that taking care of business is more important than taking care of families or making sure that the economy and the government both treat ordinary people fairly and protect their dignity and freedom.”

The case, brought on behalf of a North Carolina resident identified only as John Doe, marks what advocates say is the first settlement in the country requiring nursing homes to stop automatically rejecting patients with substance use disorders or recent drug use.
According to the complaint, Sunnybrook Rehabilitation Center in Raleigh and Treyburn Rehabilitation Center in Durham denied the man admission because of his drug use. He had been hospitalized several times between 2023 and 2025 and needed follow-up care, but after being turned away, his health deteriorated and he ended up back in the hospital.
Neither facility immediately responded to a request for comment.
“I just want to be able to get the care that everyone else gets. I want to be treated with dignity,” Doe said in a statement. “I was sick and needed help after being in the hospital, but the nursing homes said no. It was really hard for me, and it didn’t feel fair. I’m very glad this case is settled and that the nursing homes are changing their rules. Now, other people like me won’t have to go through what I did.”
Under the settlement, both facilities must adopt a substance use disorder non-discrimination policy that bars blanket denials of admission based solely on past or present substance use. Instead, they must evaluate each case individually, train staff on non-discrimination laws, and report any denials made under the new policy for one year.
The new policy must cover people currently using illegal drugs and those taking treatment medications like methadone or buprenorphine, although a Disability Rights NC spokesperson clarified that the settlement would not require facilities to allow illegal drug use on their premises.
The facilities must also establish a grievance process for alleged violations and agree to reconsider any future application for admission from the man who was denied care.
“Unfortunately, SUD-based discrimination in healthcare is far too common, and people who use or used drugs frequently do not receive care for serious, sometimes life-threatening, needs,” said Rebekah Joab, Deputy Director of Litigation and Legal Services at the Legal Action Center.
“We applaud Sunnybrook and Treyburn for making important changes to admission policies that will help protect the rights of vulnerable patients with substance use disorder to get the care they need,” Sara Harrington, an attorney at Disability Rights NC said in a statement.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nursing-care-Getty-Images.jpg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

Chuck Collins, the heir to the Oscar Mayer fortune, gave away his millions to progressive political causes when he was in his twenties. Ever since, the resident of Guilford has fought to expose how the rich make themselves richer at everyone else’s expense.
In his new book, “Burned by Billionaires: How Concentrated Wealth and Power are Ruining Our Lives and Planet,” Collins shows how the actions of the top .01% have dire consequences for everyone else. He argues that when the system is rigged to favor to rich, working people pay the price in higher taxes, fewer affordable houses and a health care system stripped of both health and care. 
Collins is a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies where he co-edits Inequality.org. He writes the Oligarch Watch column for The Nation. He is the author of a number of books, including “Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good“; and with Bill Gates Sr., “Wealth and Our Commonwealth,” a case for taxing inherited fortunes. 
Collins says we are living through a new Gilded Age. In the first Gilded Age, which lasted from about the end of the Civil War to 1900, “there were 400 wealthy families that by some estimates may have had 40 to 50% of all the wealth in the country,” Collins told the Vermont Conversation. But from 2020 to 2022, “the flow of billionaire wealth, not just to the 1% but the top one tenth of 1% in the billionaire class, is dizzying.” He said that the combined wealth of US billionaires went from under $3 trillion at the beginning of the pandemic to $7.8 trillion by the end.
“Pretty much everything you care about is undermined by that concentration of wealth and power: your health, your housing, the quality of your environment.”
Collins warned of the danger of “billionaire capture.”
“You have the billionaires lining up behind one particular presidential candidate who has totally delivered for the billionaire class to the point where our political system is captured. … They are using that government shutdown as a way to shrink government and lay off workers. And we’re not even going to publish unemployment rates and the data necessary for us to understand what’s happening in the economy.”
Collins believes that change will come from both the grassroots and from “cracks within the billionaire elites that we should be paying attention to,” such as those who want to address climate change.
“As people start to see how their pockets are getting picked, they will wake up and want to push back on this oligarchic capture of our society.”
Collins says that change begins by taxing enormous wealth, reinvesting in social programs, and in grassroots mobilizations such as “No Kings Day” that represent “an awakening that we have never seen.”
“We have to say, Look, we’re not going to vote for people who are going to be lapdogs of the billionaires. … We’re going to see people run for Congress and win and run for higher office saying, I want an economy that works for everybody, not just the billionaires.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New leadership for the troubled New Mexico Children Youth and Families Department said on Tuesday the agency is in the process of overhauling the system that reviews fatalities and critical incidents for children in its care, after failing to meet the deadline to deliver data to independent reviewers.
CYFD was supposed to provide information about deaths and near-deaths in state custody to independent child welfare experts who are overseeing the agency’s reform efforts during a hearing held Tuesday, according to a July order by the arbiter in the ongoing issues in treatment of foster children.
Those reforms trace back to a 2018 class-action lawsuit, informally called Kevin S., which alleged that children neither received adequate treatment nor were placed in appropriate foster homes. The agency and advocates settled the lawsuit in 2020, but CYFD has failed multiple times to meet the deadlines set in the landmark settlement agreement, and was brought into arbitration to address issues including staff turnover, treatment of children in the state’s care and foster parent shortages.
A Sept. 27 letter from the independent child welfare experts overseeing the reforms noted that CYFD had identified “seven fatalities and eight near-fatalities” since Jan. 1, but said that the agency had only provided the children’s initials and “limited information.”
During Tuesday’s status hearing before Charles Peifer, an Albuquerque attorney appointed as arbiter in the case, CYFD leadership acknowledged the agency did not send the data to the independent child welfare experts, who are called co-neutrals.
“The reason it wasn’t delivered timely was that it does have to come from various sources I have to run around, as does my team, to identify it,” Kathy Kunkel, a deputy secretary for the department, said. “We appreciate that this is not a system, and that’s where we are today.”
Kunkel promised the information would be released on Friday, and said a new policy for incidents and a review will be presented by the end of the month.
The nearly three-hour long meeting touched on additional concerns that the agency is not ensuring that children entering the state’s custody see a doctor, and that high staff turnover and burnout are contributing to foster parent attrition.
The agency is one month into new leadership following former CYFD Secretary Teresa Casados’ retirement on Sept. 5. Her departure followed criticism about the state’s reform progress, as well as high-profile suicides of children in the agency’s care this year that sparked investigations by state authorities.
The co-neutrals said the communication with new leadership at CYFD has been “proactive,” but noted that the agency is still slow in releasing data and struggling to meet goals, such as certifying 265 new non-kin foster homes. Instead, they said, between January and August, the agency only licensed 61 homes, less than a quarter of the target. Moreover, they said,
CYFD “has not consistently implemented a coordinated plan or effective strategies” for foster family recruitment and retention.
Kunkel, Acting CYFD Secretary Valerie Sandoval and Chief Operating Officer Brenda Donald all appeared at Tuesday’s hearing.
Donald disputed the co-neutrals’ figures, and said CYFD has 72 new foster homes as of October, and has also added 230 new relatives caring for children in custody.
“We consider that a value and want to continue doing as much as we can to support those placements,” Donald said.
Kunkel also said the state implemented additional payments of $400 per month for foster families willing to take children with higher behavioral and mental health needs.
In closing remarks, Sandoval acknowledged the agency remains far from being in compliance with the requirements of the settlement agreement, but highlighted what she characterized as improvements that have been made: increased pay in the Foster Care plus program; shortened hiring times; and added fixes for pay for multiple types of workers.
“I know that we have a lot of work ahead and we still are a ways away from meeting all of our obligations,” Sandoval said. “But I just want to say that I am committed as the acting cabinet secretary, as well as this team sitting in this room, is very committed and we’re ready to excel and push forward on the obligations.”
Peifer complimented Sandoval’s efforts and commended the team she has put together, but concluded the hearing that more needed to be done for children in state care.
“There have been no shortage of plans and no shortage of well-intentioned people in your position or in the position that your colleagues hold,” he said. “I take for granted that everybody is going to do their best, but success is not based on intentions or statements or expressions of a desire to do better; it’s going to be measured for the purposes of the settlement agreement, compliance for the remedial orders and measurable success for the kids.”

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An eastern Kansas school district was the only one in the state that banned a book during the 2024-2025 school year, according to an annual report cataloguing bans and restrictions across the country.
The Gardner Edgerton School District, which has schools in Johnson and Miami counties, in December removed “Lily and Dunkin,” by Donna Gephart, from the school library. The book, which details the friendship of two Florida eighth graders, one navigating her transgender identity and the other grappling with his mental health, was not required reading.
The book was one of more than 3,700 titles banned in 87 public school districts across 23 states during the last school year, according to PEN America, an organization that tracks book banning, disinformation and educational censorship.
In total, the organization found 6,870 instances of book banning in the U.S. during the most recent school year, according to the report released Oct. 1. That number is down from the previous school year, when the organization clocked more than 10,000 book bans, according to data from the organization’s four years of reports.
“In 2022, we cautioned that book bans and related threats to free expression and the First Amendment should not be ignored; that this assault on students’ freedom to read is a slippery slope; and that state censorship of this nature, once unleashed, would snowball,” the 2025 report said. “Today, that escalation is no longer hypothetical. For many students, families, educators, librarians, and school districts, book banning is a new normal.”
PEN America defines a book ban as “any action taken against a book based on its content and as a result of parent or community challenges, administrative decisions, or in response to direct or threatened action by governmental officials, that leads to a book being either completely removed from availability to students, or where access to a book is restricted or diminished.”
The report relies on three types of bans. “Banned” refers to outright prohibition. “Banned pending investigation” requires further evaluation, and “banned by restriction” can include grade-level restrictions or books that require parental permission. “Lily and Dunkin” is outright banned in the Gardner Edgerton School District.
Ben Boothe, the assistant superintendent of educational services for the district, declined to comment when reached by email Tuesday.
However, the district school board members discussed “Lily and Dunkin” during a December meeting, when the majority of members voted to remove the book from school shelves.
Tom Reddin, the school board president, said the book contained good pieces.
“But for me, I couldn’t get over the repetitive pushing of puberty blockers,” he said.
Katie Williams, one of two board members who voted to keep the book on shelves, said she appreciated how the book encouraged youths to seek medical attention for gender-affirming care and mental health care.
She said kids in their district are undergoing the same things as the book’s characters, and it could be a useful resource.
Greg Chapman said he was a “no” vote from the beginning, favoring the removal of the book from shelves.
“There’s no good qualities of the book, to me, and it shocked me that so many staff members were on board with this book and praising it so heavily,” he said.
He also said he thought “it was a terrible book for men and for fathers,” because of character developments leading to the father “caving,” in Chapman’s words.
One person filed a petition for the district’s book review committee to evaluate “Lily and Dunkin.” One person on the committee objected to keeping the book on school library shelves. Board member Heath Freeman said the committee’s support carried weight in his decision to vote against removing the book.
“One of the keys in my perspective as a school board member is that we should promote acceptance, and when we pull things from the shelf that either try to hide or try to — and I’m not accusing anyone of doing so, it’s just a perspective for those that might see this decision — either dismiss someone’s experience, hide their experience or not provide them access to things that they could find comfort in by shared experiences, then I think we’re doing a disservice to those kids who absolutely are in this world,” he said.
Last school year was not the first time the Gardner Edgerton School District garnered attention for book banning. In 2022, two parents led the charge to ban “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian” from being used in the district’s English class curricula. The semi-autobiographical 2007 book follows the life of a Native American teenager throughout one school year. Goddard Public Schools and Derby Public Schools banned the book a year earlier.
The Gardner Edgerton district also in 2022 approved a policy targeting trans students, forbidding them from using their preferred restroom or playing on a sports team that doesn’t align with their sex assigned at birth, which can differ from gender identity.
The new PEN America report indicated that actions from the federal government have influenced book banning in the U.S. — from President Donald Trump’s executive orders that reference “radical indoctrination in K-12 schools,” “gender ideology extremism,” and “radical and wasteful DEI programs and preferencing,” to the U.S. Department of Education declaring book bans a hoax. 
Plus, the report said, ​​“persistent attacks conflate LGBTQ+ identities as ‘sexually explicit’ and erase LGBTQ+ representation from schools” since book banning ballooned in 2021. The report forecasts greater censorship of LGBTQ+ content nationwide.
“Rather than offering histories, stories, and books that reflect all students and families, LGBTQ+ stories will be omitted from classrooms,” the report said. “LGBTQ+ students and their families will effectively be denied the freedom to read about themselves and those around them.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gardner-Edgerton-school-office-1-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

(Jordan Hansen/Daily Montanan)BOZEMAN – In what felt at times like a solemn church service and others a rock concert celebrating conservatism, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy took the stage Tuesday night at Turning Point USA’s event on Montana State’s campus in Bozeman.
The organization’s founder, Charlie Kirk, was killed last month during a Turning Point event in Utah. Both Gianforte and Ramaswamy shared stories and lessons they took from the late right-wing influencer. Both men also used the event as a call to action for conservatives, giving those in attendance ideas on ways to uphold their version of Kirk’s legacy. Ramaswamy also took questions from the crowd for about an hour.
Around 3,000 people attended the event, held at Brick Breeden Fieldhouse and scheduled prior to Kirk’s death. Finance CEO Laine Schoneberger, of Yrefy, also spoke during the event.

There was no loud music and the security presence was noticeable – prior to the event, even Montana State athletes looking to enter the fieldhouse had to empty their pockets and step through a metal detector. 
Not everyone in attendance followed Kirk prior to his death, including Paul Colella, 59, from Manhattan. Colella decided to come, he said, to support the overall cause and said the conservative movement in the country has never been stronger.
“Trying to awaken a silenced group that, we think, has been silenced for a long time, and now, I think this whole event and the past few months has awakened that flame,” Colella said.
Many, including Colella, said they respected how Kirk interacted with people who did not share his views. One of Turning Point USA’s goals is to engage college students, which Kirk often did.
“I always appreciated that he would take the folks that did not agree with him and put him to the front of the line and say, let’s have a conversation,” Colella said. “And to me, I don’t see as much on the other side. I wish I did, but I don’t.”
Some figures in Montana state politics, including Flathead Rep. Braxton Mitchell, joined the event. Mitchell caught the attention of Turning Point in his youth, he told the Flathead Beacon last month.
“It was a great event and I was extremely encouraged to see so many other young people show up and express their beliefs and opinions,” Mitchell said in an email to the Daily Montanan on Wednesday. “This is truly a ‘Turning Point’ in our state and country. The Left has no idea what beast they’ve awakened after murdering our generations top political voice.”
Videos, including clips of Kirk speaking, played prior to Gianforte and Ramaswamy taking the stage, highlighted this idea. 
“They’re deciding, even though it might jeopardize their job, their career or their reputation, to put their country over themselves,” Kirk said in a video speaking about college students involved with Turning Point USA.
Following Kirk’s death, conservative influencers targeted individuals — including some people in Montana — for social media comments made following his death. There was some celebration over Kirk’s murder which caused anger in conservative circles, though many progressive politicians were quick to renounce his killing.
Kirk was a controversial figure, generating backlash because of his views on race, sexuality and even COVID.

Though Kirk had gained fame through the use of social media, Gianforte’s message to the crowd of younger-skewing audience members was similar to that of his fellow Western-state governor Spencer Cox, a Republican from Utah, where Kirk was slain. 
Gianforte told the crowd to spend less time online and more time “touching grass,” a phrase Cox used to describe needing to disconnect after spending a long time on screens. 
“We cannot and should not retreat into the dark corners of social media,” Gianforte said. “Seek out people with different views, engage them in respectful in person dialog, go get a coffee.”
Gianforte —  an unabashedly conservative Christian — also told the audience the first way they could honor Kirk was “to pursue faith in God.”
Gianforte spoke for about 15 minutes and shared his memories of Kirk. The governor was one of Turning Point’s original donors, he said, and also spoke about a three-day hike he took with Kirk. Gianforte began and ended with a prayer, in what felt more like a sermon than a politician’s speech.
“God’s plan for the world is to overcome evil with good. Charlie did that. The Bible says the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness did not overcome it,” Gianforte said. “What is that light? The Bible tells us it’s Jesus. Charlie did not know his assassin, but I have no doubt that he loved him.”

Christianity became a central theme of the evening, with Ramaswamy — who is Hindu — asked several questions regarding his faith, which led to discussion of the Christian Holy Trinity and monotheism.
One person asked how Ramaswamy was able to mix his personal beliefs with those of Turning Point, a Christian organization.
“In my faith, I believe there’s one true God,” Ramaswamy said. “He resides in all of us, and He appears in different forms, but it’s one true God. So I’m an ethical monotheist. That’s the way I would describe my faith.”
He also said conservatives have an “obligation” to stand up for the “truth God is real.” Other questions he got included the topics of abortion, Israel and the job market.
Time is also running short to implement changes conservatives want to see, he added.
“If we don’t utilize the levers of power now, if we don’t stamp out toxic dissent, now if we don’t rectify the country now, then we never will,” Ramaswamy said. “We have a short window to act right now, and we got to step up and seize the moment.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TPUSA1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

Two of the three finalists set to head to campus for interviews “suddenly withdrew their names from consideration” to be chosen as DMACC’s next president, according to a Wednesday news release. DMACC Board President and presidential search committee chair Kevin Halterman said in an interview both candidates pulled out for personal reasons — “nothing that was alarming, just unfortunate for us.”
Halterman said in the release he feels good about the third candidate’s quality, but bringing only one finalist to campus wouldn’t allow the college community to consider different leadership styles and approaches when it comes to DMACC and their vision for the future. Candidates were supposed to come to campus in mid-October for interviews, he said.

“While this is a disappointing development for our search, we are committed to getting the right candidate, even if it takes longer than we’d originally planned,” Halterman said in the release.
Denson, DMACC’s current and longest-serving president, announced his retirement in January and set his last day for Dec. 30. The college board of directors will hold a special meeting online at 2 p.m. Friday to discuss the possibility of appointing an interim president after Denson’s departure if a new president hasn’t been selected, Halterman said in the interview.
Larry Ebbers, the search consultant hired by DMACC to help with the presidential search, will join the board at its Oct. 13 meeting to sketch out a plan going forward.
“Despite this temporary setback, we remain confident in the search process and the attractiveness of this job,” Halterman said in the release. “DMACC is a strong institution with outstanding students, faculty, and staff. They deserve another equally great president.”

In his order, […]","Photo illustration by Getty Images.A Butte-Silver Bow County District Court judge has ruled a lawsuit alleging the state has violated its constitutional duty to equalize taxes fairly so that the burden doesn’t fall disproportionately to residential taxpayers can continue, even though attorneys for the Montana Department of Revenue had asked for the case to be dismissed.
In his order, judge Robert J. Whelan said that residents Thomas and Cindra Lord-Powers and Ryan and Elizabeth Swenson have made a prima facia case that would seem to suggest that the Gianforte administration and the Montana Department of Revenue made no attempt to equalize the taxes, as required by the Montana Constitution. Article VIII of the constitution says that property taxes can’t be shifted unfairly or disproportionately onto residential property owners.
Previously, attorneys for the state had told the court that the exclusive remedy allowed in state law was to challenge a county assessment of property taxes. Meanwhile, attorneys for the residents said that they weren’t contesting the actual valuations assigned to their property, rather that the administration had failed to equitably equalize property taxes, especially for larger businesses, and instead shifted that burden to residential property tax owners.
“At this pleading stage, (the property owners) have unquestionably pled a failure of (the state) to perform any equalization to account for the shifting of tax burden from commercial to residential property owners which arose from the alleged use of different appraisal methodologies during a period of rapid inflation,” Whelan said in his order.
The judge also determined that Montana law cannot stop residents from seeking justice in court, and that the Legislature couldn’t provide only an administrative remedy for a constitutional right.
“Section 15-1-406 does not provide a remedy for the equalization failure pled in this case, nor does any other statute in Montana’s tax code,” the order said. “The constitutionally mandated balancing between and among different classes of taxpayers must be addressable with a remedy adequate to resolve the unavoidable constitutional duty to achieve such balancing.”
Whelan also said that residential property owners in this case weren’t disputing their own assessments, rather challenging the “principle” which the state used to determine all taxes.
“While an erroneous outcome for an individual taxpayer can be remedied individually, an erroneous outcome for whole classes of similarly situated or affected taxpayers — including taxpayers who benefit by not paying their fair, equalized share — requires exceptional relief,” the order said.
The lawsuit was filed in 2024, before the 2025 Legislature made several changes to the state’s tax code, including the way Montana will classify second homes or vacation property. Still, the lawsuit raises questions about whether Montana’s assessment of taxes makes sure businesses and “centrally assessed” properties — those are businesses that have multiple properties throughout the state — are paying their fair share.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1410759881-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

But on Wednesday, Diamantis’ defense attorney, Norm Pattis, sought to shift the narrative to show that it was Diamantis who was being taken advantage of.  
Pattis used the cross examination of Antonietta DiBenedetto Roy, the owner of Construction Advocacy Professionals, to argue that she willingly hired Diamantis’ daughter in order to gain favor with him.
Roy told the jurors on Tuesday that she selected Diamantis’ daughter for a $40 per hour job at her firm and that she later secured several lucrative contracts overseeing local school projects in Tolland, Hartford and New Britain, as a result.
Pattis argued on Tuesday, however, that Diamantis never forced Roy to hire his daughter or to award her additional bonuses. 
“Mr. Diamantis never told you to hire his daughter, correct?” Pattis asked.
“Not directly,” Roy replied.
Roy also acknowledged after further questioning that Diamantis never directly threatened to harm her company if she refused to keep paying his daughter.
[The Kosta Diamantis Timeline: What you need to know]
Pattis suggested to the jury that Roy’s statements were evidence that she undertook those actions on her own to gain influence with Diamantis and to profit off the work on Connecticut school projects.
“I did need to keep him happy,” Roy told Pattis during the exchange.
“But that was on you,” Pattis said, adding that Diamantis never made a direct threat to harm Roy’s company.
“Mr. Diamantis created an atmosphere of fear,” Roy said, adding that he had immense influence over who worked on school projects.
“It was his demeanor within the industry,” she added. “You didn’t want to be on his bad side.” 
Pattis did not try to directly refute any of the hard evidence that prosecutors shared with the jury the day before, including the existence of several checks that Roy made out to Diamantis.
But he used Roy’s testimony to argue that that money was intended as political contributions that were needed to get construction projects accomplished in places like Hartford.
Pattis openly acknowledged on several occasions that Diamantis held a large amount of “power” and “clout” as the head of the Connecticut Office of School Construction Grants and Review, but Pattis argued it was that prominent position that prompted construction contractors to try to cozy up to Diamantis.  
Pattis’ defense strategy focused on showing that Diamantis never extorted any school construction contractors, as the prosecutors have claimed.
The two assistant U.S. Attorneys leading the prosecution allowed Pattis to question Roy with nearly no interruptions or objections. And when she was done testifying, they quickly moved ahead with other parts of their case.
During his opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis said the case against Diamantis could be summarized in two parts: “bribes” and “influence.”
The first two witnesses to testify in the trial — Roy and John Duffy, the vice president of Acranom Masonry — told jurors that they bribed Diamantis by hiring his daughter and paying him tens of thousands of dollars.
The witnesses who took the stand on Wednesday afternoon, however, were meant to highlight the vast influence Diamantis exerted on behalf of those contractors. 
First, the jury heard from Brian Ouelette, the president of Newfield Construction.
Ouelette, who worked as a construction manager on the Weaver High School project in Hartford, told the jury how Diamantis helped to resolve a billing dispute between the city and Acranom Masonry, which resulted in the company earning an additional $300,000.
And he described how Diamantis stepped in to make sure Acranom won another contract worth more than $3 million for that same high school, despite concerns about the company’s reportedly “subpar” workmanship on the project. 
Ouelette told the jury that Diamantis directly intervened on Acranom’s behalf to make sure they were paid. During the billing dispute, Ouelette said, Diamantis called him and other construction officials into his office in Hartford and took Acranom’s side.
Prosecutors also showed the jury an email in which members of Ouelette’s team said they had no choice but to hire Acranom on another phase of the project because Diamantis controlled the “power of the purse” and said the state would not pay for the masonry work unless Acranom got the job.
“The project has no financial choice but to award to Acranom,” the email said.
During that testimony, Diamantis rocked slowly in his chair at the defense table. 
Pattis portrayed Diamantis’ actions as those of someone who was trying to save the state money and to avoid a costly lawsuit with Acranom.
“Kosta was a hands-on director, and that rubbed people the wrong way, right?” Pattis asked Ouelette.
“Is that a question?” Ouelette asked.
After Ouelette was done testifying, prosecutors called Sal Salafia, another experienced construction official, to the witness stand to testify about how Roy’s company was picked to be a project manager on the Bulkeley High School project in Hartford.
Salafia, who worked for O&G Industries for more than 30 years, said his company was already representing the city of Hartford on that project as a project manager. 
But he told the jury that Diamantis issued a directive for the city to hire another company to perform the same type of work. That company ended up being Construction Advocacy Professionals.

(Photo by Sarahbeth Maney/ProPublica)Oil producer Chevron is laying off more than 100 workers in North Dakota after acquiring Hess Corp., a greater impact than initially expected. 
Chevron notified Job Service North Dakota that it would lay off 111 workers — 63 in Minot and 48 at Tioga — beginning Sept. 26. 
Chevron completed its merger with Hess July 18, driving the layoffs. The company initially told the state there would be 70 layoffs, but revised that number higher this week. 
“We understand the impact this news may have on employees, their families and the communities where we operate,” Chevron said in a statement. “Our priority is to support our employees through this transition. We are offering severance benefits and outplacement support.”
A Chevron spokesperson said the cuts included a variety of positions. 
Growth of AI creates new markets for North Dakota natural gas, governor says

Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said Chevron’s takeover of Hess is one of several mergers in the oil and gas industry as companies seek to be more efficient in the face of lower oil prices. 
“Consolidation is part of the industry trend to try to lower your per barrel costs,” Ness said. 
Reuters reported last month that cutbacks in the U.S. oil and gas industry have been widespread.
Phil Davis, Workforce Services director for North Dakota Job Service, said the agency has not seen an increase in traffic at its Workforce Centers in Minot and Williston, which may be an indication that laid off workers have already found employment. 
A state report on North Dakota’s oil and gas economy shows 1,013 job openings in North Dakota’s four core oil and gas producing counties in August, down more than 2% from August and down more than 13% from a year ago. 
The report notes that the price of North Dakota oil is about 16% below last year’s levels. 
“The price of oil still has a major influence on the amount of activity, the amount of work out there,” Ness said. “We’ve probably seen a little bit of a dip.” 
North Dakota has 32 active drilling rigs this week, compared to 39 one year ago, according to the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. 
North Dakota is the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state.
At the North Dakota Petroleum Council’s annual meeting last month in Watford City, Chevron Vice President Kim McHugh said the company is committed to developing in shale oil formations like North Dakota’s Bakken. 
“The Bakken fits nicely into our portfolio,” she said. 
North Dakota’s unemployment rate remains low at about 2.5%.

Jon Ossoff is boasting a major fundraising haul as he heads into 2026 and the election that will determine whether he gets six more years in office.,"Sen. Jon Ossoff announce he raised $12 million in the last three months to fund his re-election campaign. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderU.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is boasting a major fundraising haul as he heads into 2026 and the election that will determine whether he gets six more years in office.
Ossoff’s camp said Wednesday that the Democratic senator’s quarterly financial disclosure, which is due to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15, will show he raised $12 million in the last three months and enters the final quarter of the year with $21 million on hand.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Ossoff’s report has not yet been made public on the FEC’s website, but his campaign says the $12 million came from more than 223,000 donors, 93% of whom made contributions of $100 or less.
“Republicans are already spending millions of dollars targeting Senator Ossoff yet our campaign continues to build an unstoppable grassroots coalition to win next November. We remain grateful for small-dollar donors who are powering us to victory,” Ossoff campaign manager Ellen Foster said in a statement.
Ossoff, who flipped his seat for Democrats in early 2021 after a tight runoff election, is the only Democratic senator running for re-election in a state won by Republican President Donald Trump in 2024. National Republicans have made Ossoff’s seat a top target for next year. Three high-profile GOP candidates have signed up to challenge him.
The Republican challengers
Republican Congressman Buddy Carter also touted his fundraising efforts on Wednesday, posting to social media that he raised nearly $900,000 in the previous quarter.
Carter says his campaign has raised nearly $4 million since he announced his run in May and leads the GOP field in cash on hand with $3.8 million. Carter’s previous FEC filing shows he loaned his campaign $2 million.
“We didn’t inherit anything from daddy. We‘re earning it — every dime, every vote,” Carter said on social media. “The others can keep fighting for second. We’re focused on winning for Georgia.”
The daddy line was likely a dig at his GOP opponents, Georgia Congressman Mike Collins and  former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley. Collins’ father was Mac Collins, a successful businessman and member of Congress, and Dooley, who entered the race with the endorsement of Gov. Brian Kemp, is the son of celebrated University of Georgia football coach Vince Dooley.
Both Collins and Dooley have claimed multi-million dollar war chests of their own to take on Ossoff.
The FEC has not yet published any of the three Republicans’ filings as of Wednesday afternoon, but earlier this week Collins and Dooley each said they raised nearly $2 million since declaring their candidacies over the summer.
Collins’ campaign is also emphasizing the role of small donors in his fundraising, claiming an average contribution of $47.31 from more than 40,000 people.
“Ossoff will be formidable and Collins is the only candidate who’s shown he’s got the small dollar, grassroots fundraising prowess that can compete for Republicans,” said Collins spokesman Corbin Keown.
Dooley’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The fundraising gap will likely shrink once Georgia GOP voters decide on their candidate. The primary election is scheduled for May 19, and Election Day is set for Nov. 3. The race is expected to be hard-fought and expensive for both sides.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-08 20:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump threatens Blumenthal with investigation after Bondi dustup,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/08/trump-blumenthal-military-investigation-pam-bondi-dustup/,Clashes between CT's U.S. senators and the Trump administration intensified as battle lines hardened with no movement on the federal shutdown.,"Shortly after U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal pressed a top Trump administration official over concerns of politically motivated prosecutions and investigations, the Connecticut Democrat got a threat of an investigation from the president himself.
President Donald Trump called for an investigation into Blumenthal Tuesday night, re-litigating a 2008 comment in which the senator said he “served in Vietnam.” It wasn’t the first time Trump went after Blumenthal, who acknowledged he misspoke, over this matter. 
But it reflected a longstanding feud that was reignited as Democrats questioned the administration on what they see as the weaponization of the government and the U.S. Department of Justice against political opponents.
“This guy shouldn’t even be in the U.S. Senate. It should be investigated, and Justice should be sought. Right now there is a Congressman sitting in prison for lying about his past during a campaign,” Trump posted on his preferred social media platform Truth Social. “Well, those lies were nothing compared to those of Richard ‘Da Nang Dick’ Blumenthal, perhaps the greatest phony in the history of the United States Senate. He should be allowed to speak no longer!”
Blumenthal brushed aside what he called an “unhinged rant” that is nothing new to him. And he argued it’s an example of the president deflecting attention as a way to not answer questions about the targeting of political foes or giving preference to those close to him. 
“I must have really gotten under Donald Trump’s skin. He seems to be lashing out with personal attacks because he doesn’t want to answer questions about why he’s covering up the Epstein files or selectively prosecuting his political adversaries or dropping antitrust cases against his corrupt cronies or a lot of other issues where he is distracting from the truth,” Blumenthal told reporters Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol.
Clashes between Connecticut’s U.S. senators and the Trump administration intensified this week as the battle lines hardened with no movement on a government shutdown.
Both Blumenthal and U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy have repeatedly raised concerns over actions taken by Trump and his allies inside and outside of the White House. They have issues repeated warnings about threats to democracy and free speech. And while they sought to keep the heat on, the administration also fiercely defended its approach and came out swinging against specific Democratic lawmakers, including Blumenthal.
Blumenthal said he wouldn’t be “silenced or intimidated by [Trump’s] bullying.”
Trump’s post about Blumenthal stemmed from a contentious exchange at a Tuesday hearing between the senator and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that at one point turned personal.
Blumenthal used his time during the hearing to ask about conversations Bondi may have had with the president regarding the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey as well as any contact with someone tied to her former workplace. He brought signs to the hearing that showed Trump’s social media post directed toward Bondi about several Trump critics and saying that “justice should be served.” On Wednesday, Comey pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers will seek to dismiss the case as a “vindictive prosecution.”
“In fact, five days before the indictment of James Comey, he put this post up as instructions to you. He didn’t mince words. He was very open and public that you should indict James Comey and others because they are ‘Guilty as hell. No more delay. Now.’ Five days before you indicted — or a grand jury at your instructions indicted James Comey,” Blumenthal said. 
He repeatedly pressed Bondi and asked whether she had any conversations with Trump about prosecuting Comey before the DOJ’s indictment.
Bondi declined to publicly detail any conversations she had with the president 
“You are an attorney. You have a law degree, and you know that I’m not going to do that,” Bondi said, reading a quote from him in 2017 when Blumenthal said that no one is above the law and “the judicial process move forward without political interference.”
During their testy back-and-forth, Bondi made a dig at Blumenthal and his past characterizations of his military service.
It came up as Blumenthal questioned Bondi over mergers and any conversations she had with Brian Ballard, the head of the law firm where she formerly worked. He asked about Ballard’s lobbying the Justice Department on antitrust issues. 
“Sen. Blumenthal, I cannot believe that you would accuse me of impropriety when you lied about your military service. You lied — you admitted you lied — to be elected a U.S. senator. You lied. How dare you. I’m a career prosecutor. Don’t you ever challenge my integrity,” Bondi said.
Blumenthal said he wasn’t questioning her integrity and asked her again about conversations with Ballard, which went unanswered. His five minutes of questioning during the hearing ended with her saying she’s “abided by every ethics standard.”
At a press conference in 2010, Blumenthal, who was a stateside U.S. Marine Corps reservist during the Vietnam War, denied he lied about his military service and acknowledged that he “misspoke” in 2008. At that time, he told an audience in Norwalk, “We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.”
“I fully addressed the issue of my military service 15 years ago, and the voters of Connecticut had rejected it in three separate elections when they overwhelmingly voted in favor of me,” Blumenthal said Wednesday. “I’m proud of my military service, having been in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve for six years and honorably discharged as a sergeant.”
Meanwhile, hours after Blumenthal and Bondi’s clash, Murphy continued his grim warnings about how democracy in the U.S. could slip into authoritarianism through various efforts like National Guard troop deployments to certain cities and the threats to broadcast licenses of media groups.

U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy delivered a floor speech on Tuesday, Oct. 7, arguing that democracy in the U.S. is “on the verge of an authoritarian takeover.” Credit: C-SPAN
He went step-by-step to explain that democracies don’t always fall victim to seminal moments like a coup or violence. Instead, Murphy argued, a democracy typically erodes more slowly over time because “the party in power just contracts the space for dissent, for speech, for political opposition.”
“You can’t see the indictment of Comey, the cancellation of [Jimmy] Kimmel, the troops in Chicago as different events. They are all part of the same story. They are all part of a plan, a well-thought out plan to try to destroy American democracy and create a new set of rules that will allow Trump and his allies to rule forever,” Murphy said in a floor speech Tuesday as a few other senators spoke about the shutdown.
“I know this sounds extreme. It is,” he continued. “But if you connect the dots, if you allow yourself to see the whole story, the totality of this story, you will see the grave danger that we are in.”
Murphy, who has been lauded on the left as an emerging leader of the party and criticized by the right as a Trump antagonist, has been persistent in his argument that democracy is on the line. He acknowledged Tuesday that his Republican colleagues dismiss his persistent warnings as an exaggeration. And the White House and Trump himself have taken issue with Murphy’s rhetoric that they have described as inflammatory.
But for Murphy, it’s a sentiment he believes must be deliberately spelled out before it’s too late.
“We are on the verge of an authoritarian takeover. We are in the middle of it,” Murphy said. “It’s not certain to be successful, but if we aren’t clear-eyed about what’s happening, then we have no chance to arrest it.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.58.45-AM-1024x571.png,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

(Photo illustration by Getty Images.)The Montana Legislature grappled with a lot of technological innovation during the 2025 session including determining how to regulate the growing digital economy and this month has seen the launch of new laws and committees focused on the digital space. 
One new law, the Financial Freedom and Innovation Act, took effect in October, paving the way for companies that issue network tokens to do business in Montana, and ensuring the State Auditor’s office has authority to regulate the burgeoning industry and prosecute bad actors. 
The bill, Senate Bill 265, carried by Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, defines a number of buzzwords in the digital asset space — such as network token, blockchain, and decentralized network — in state law. It also provides the framework for uses of network tokens and what boxes businesses must check off to do business in Montana. 
Under the new Innovation Act in Montana, companies that issue digital tokens — used to power decentralized services like computing, data storage and media streaming, among other things — can register with the Commissioner’s office as non-securities assets, making Montana among the first states to do so.  
Zolnikov said network tokens have the ability to decentralize so many parts of industry, essentially cutting out middle man companies, which he said fits a Montanan ethos. 
“If you have a new technology that’s an exception to the rule, but you want to play by the rules, what do you do?” he said. “We finally gave them a regulatory path forward.”
In a press release, Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Jim Brown said the new law charts the course for “responsible innovation.”
“This law gives entrepreneurs the certainty they need while ensuring Montanans are protected. SB 265 strengthens both our business climate and our national reputation as a state that embraces innovation while striking the right balance,” Brown said. 
Speaking to the Daily Montanan this week, Brown said that one of his office’s main roles is to protect Montana consumers from “fraudsters and bad actors.”
“Not only in the insurance area, but in financial institutions, which includes digital currencies and anything related to the blockchain,” Brown said. “…At this point in the world of digital currency, there isn’t a whole lot on the books in Montana about giving either my office or the attorney general’s office the authority to either regulate companies or persons who engage in this.”
On the consumer protection front, Brown has been advocating on a national level to strengthen laws in the digital space. He recently joined with securities regulators from across the nation in urging the federal government to move forward with regulating aspects of the digital economy, including giving states prosecutorial authority in the digital space. 
In a letter sent last month, Brown and his counterparts with the North American Securities Administrators Association asked for changes to a proposed federal market structure legislation that he said “is a gift to fraudsters,” by limited actions states can take to investigate and charge crypto scammers. 
The Association is also behind legislation called the Support Anti-Fraud Enforcement (SAFE) Act which would cement state authority to prosecute fraud involving digital assets. 
“We believe we have the authority to go after these bad actors,” Brown said. “I take the authority of this office to prosecute bad actors very seriously to protect consumers. … and we don’t want to create a system where smaller bad actors fall through the cracks.”
Brown said with the explosion of digital assets in recent years, his office has seen a parallel increase in fraudulent claims within the digital space. 
Last year, his office received nine complaints of digital asset fraud, totaling more than a million dollars. Through September of this year, his office has already received 20 complaints — to the tune of $3.1 million. 
On Tuesday, Brown’s office issued a press release about an individual charged in Missoula County for defrauding investors, including several elderly Montanans, through a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. 
According to the release, an Idaho resident and two uncharged co-conspirators set up a “fund” of more than one million dollars from investors purportedly invested in cryptocurrency. 
The defendant is charged with six felony counts of elder exploitation, securities fraud, operating a pyramid promotional scheme and operating as a securities dealer without a license. 
“By the end of the century, (blockchain technology and digital assets) are going to be so integrated in our economy and our way of life that people won’t even recognize how we operated financially in 2025,” Brown told the Daily Montanan. “While that’s exciting and I want to be on the forefront as a regulator and help support that, we have to keep our ability to prosecute bad actors. We can’t have it be the wild west out here.”
  Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force holds first meeting 

On Monday, members of the newly formed Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force met for the first time to discuss the state of cryptocurrency and digital asset regulation in Montana and how to remain competitive in the digital economy. 
The task force, created during the 2025 Legislature, is comprised of legislators, representatives from the State Auditor and Attorney General’s offices, and public members with experience in the financial or digital technology sectors. 
Co-chair Sen. Gayle Lammars, R-Hardin, said he envisions the task force as “a big brainstorming operation.”
“So many people think about crypto when they think about blockchain, but it’s so much more than that, so much more than the financial end of it,” Lammars told the task force. “But, it has implications in agriculture, fraud, chain of custody, record keeping — all kinds of things we could apply this baby to.”
One area of discussion on Monday revolved around Wyoming’s approach to digital assets, which has included launching their own state-backed cryptocurrency. 
“They’ve certainly laid the baseline for this,” Brown, a member of the task force, told the Daily Montanan. “We might not be looking at having Montana be the issuer of a stablecoin, but we will look at a model of what’s made Wyoming a leader in blockchain technology … we’ll look at how Montana can be an innovator like Wyoming is, maybe even going beyond what they’ve done.”
In upcoming meetings, the task force will focus on educational sessions to understand the scope of the digital economy and identify specific topics to tackle, as well as examine how the other states are currently regulating blockchain and other digital technologies. 
“I think we’re going to be able to come up with some real great stuff here to make our lives easier, and to protect the people in Montana,” Lammars said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/crypto-currency-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

Hillary Cassel poses in front of the Holocaust memorial outside the Florida Capitol on March 25, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A Florida lawmaker who suddenly switched parties last year filed a state version of a federal bill Wednesday that would ban courts and agencies from using Shari’a Law.
Rep. Hillary Cassel, a Broward Republican who served in the state House as a Democrat for two years, issued HB 119 banning Florida courts, panels, tribunals, or agencies from basing decisions on the Islamic Shari’a code or other foreign legal systems.
Cassel’s measure comes a month after U.S. Rep. Randy Fine, also a Florida Republican, filed a nearly identical bill outlawing enforcement of Sharia law.
Shari’a is Islam’s legal system derived from the Quran. Its interpretations vary depending on five schools of thought and local culture, guiding ethical conduct and suggesting criminal punishments.
When asked for an interview inside the Capitol by a Phoenix reporter, Cassel said, “Not today,” and referred the reporter to her office, which did not respond to a text message. When asked later why she filed the measure, Cassel asked, “Did you read the bill?” and walked off when asked whether she based it on Fine’s bill.
Entitled the “No Shari’a Act,” the bill recognizes that although state entities may “freely contract,” that right is nullified when it comes to a foreign legal code — like Shari’a — that would “violate the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the State Constitution.”
Rulings or decisions of a state court, arbitration panel, tribunal, or administrative agency based on “Shari’a or any foreign law, legal code, or system,” or any contract providing for “the choice of Shari’a or any foreign law, legal code, or system,” would be declared null and void.
Heightened religious tensions spark legislation
The measure comes amid religious tensions heightened by the war in Gaza. Israel launched a no-holds-barred counter-offensive in Gaza to root out Hamas, a Palestinian designated-terrorist organization funded by Iran, after the militia massacred Israelis at a music festival on Oct. 7, 2023.
The Israeli response has left tens of thousands of Palestinians dead, splitting U.S. politicians over whether to keep backing Israel or support Palestinians in their quest for statehood. President Donald Trump is engaging in peace talks between Palestinian authorities and Israeli politicos.
The Middle Eastern war has had political ramifications felt throughout the United States. Both antisemitism and Islamophobia spiked following Oct. 7 while politicians nationwide either heartily backed Israel — as most did in Florida — or urged an immediate end to hostilities. Liberal college students set up university encampments demanding a divestment of funds from Israel while the right urged continued war in Gaza.
Fine, a former state senator who was the Legislature’s sole Jewish Republican, was the staunchest pro-Israel member and frequently made inflammatory social media comments such as urging “Bombs Away” in Gaza. Now a member of Congress, he filed his “No Shari’a Act” in September, Newsweek reported.
State Rep. Chase Tramont, a Port Orange Republican, filed a bill last month similarly arising from the Gaza war that would ban state agencies from mentioning the West Bank, the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory, and enforce “Judea and Samaria” as its official name.

Photo: Adobe StockFood assistance programs threatened by the federal government shutdown will continue in North Carolina through October, the state Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday, despite earlier concerns that at least one might run out of money.
The nutrition program for women, infants, and children, or WIC, helps low-income pregnant, recently pregnant and breastfeeding women, and babies and children up to age 5. 
Benefits are used for “WIC approved” items such as infant cereal, baby foods, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, peas and beans. WIC also offers breastfeeding support, nutrition education and medical referrals. About 262,000 women, babies, and children use WIC in North Carolina, according to DHHS.
When the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the National WIC Association estimated that funding could run out in a week or two. However, the White House said Tuesday it will use tariff revenue to keep WIC afloat. 
The federal supplemental nutritional assistance program, or SNAP, is an even larger program.
About 1.4 million people in the state use SNAP to buy food, according to a DHHS press release. Beneficiaries must meet income limits and benefit amounts are based on household size. 
The federal government provided October benefits for SNAP in September before the shutdown started, according to the nonprofit Federal Research and Action Center. 
“Food and nutrition are foundational to good health and people should not have to worry about their families and communities going hungry,” state Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said in a statement. “NCDHHS hopes for a quick resolution to the federal shutdown to ensure people in North Carolina are not at risk of losing critical food benefits.”
Congress failed to agree on a budget to fund the federal government after Sept. 30.

Its former rep in Congress writes that Nashville provides a cautionary tale against splitting the state’s largest city into multiple districts. (Getty Images)The ugly specter of mid-term gerrymandering may be rearing its head in Kentucky, and the potential disruption to our state’s federal representation is impossible to overstate.
It started in Texas when President Donald Trump urged lawmakers there to redraw their congressional district boundaries in order to create more Republican seats and help protect the GOP’s slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Predictably, Texas Republicans, supported by Trump acolyte Gov. Greg Abbott, complied. In response, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has initiated a process designed to do the same thing in his state, which could balance any Republican gains in Texas.
Historically, redistricting is done every 10 years following the decennial census. This makes sense because House seats are allocated based on population, which can change significantly over 10 years.
It is highly unusual for states to redraw district lines between censuses unless they are ordered to do so by the courts. In fact, since 1970, only Texas (twice) and Georgia have redistricted for partisan advantage. But now a redistricting battle is underway, and every state with one-party control and seats held by the minority party is under pressure to enter the fray. Kentucky is in that category.
My former seat, Kentucky’s 3rd Congressional District, the one now occupied by Morgan McGarvey, is one of the most “logical” districts anywhere. It currently includes all but roughly 20,000 people who live in Louisville Metro, and none outside the city lines. There is no confusion as to what member of Congress represents the interests of the Louisville community, including, for example, the University of Louisville. The mayor and the U.S. representative for the 3rd District have essentially the same constituencies, making coordination of multi-governmental efforts very effective and efficient.
Now there is discussion among some Republicans in Frankfort about splitting the Louisville community into three different congressional districts, presumably making it almost impossible, in the current environment, for a Democrat to be elected. This strategy was discussed briefly after the 2020 census, but the five Republican members of the Kentucky House delegation, along with Sen. Mitch McConnell, convinced Republicans in the General Assembly that it was a bad idea.
Under the concept under discussion back then, for example, a portion of Louisville would have become part of a district that extended south to the Tennessee border. Understandably, the Republican members of the federal delegation were happy with their “safe” districts and didn’t want a bunch of Louisville Democratic voters in their jurisdictions.
I don’t believe McConnell ever made any public comments about the idea, but I’m sure he understood the political risk of doing something so damaging to his hometown, and also the University of Louisville, to which he has always been fiercely loyal.
Now the idea apparently has resurfaced, as some Republican members of the Kentucky legislature somehow think they haven’t done enough to disenfranchise many Kentuckians, especially Louisvillians.
Federal court upholds Tennessee’s U.S. House map, rules it’s gerrymandered but not racially

Wiser heads must prevail. Tennessee offers a vivid lesson as to the damage such a move would do. Legislators there split Nashville into three districts during their decennial process. Now the state’s capital has three people representing it in the U.S. House, and this is one case in which more is not better.
The math is simple. Each congressional district across the country includes roughly 750,000 people. If you divide a district by three, that means in Nashville, 250,000 people are placed in a new district with 500,000 other Tennesseans, most of whom have little in common with them. If you are their representative, whose interests will have your priority? Clearly it is the 500,000, who will most likely have given you your victory margin.
Right now, Nashville has a Democratic mayor. He must work with three Republican representatives on any federal initiative. I recently spoke with a political scientist at Vanderbilt University who outlined the problems with such a setup. Vanderbilt, for example, has had to reorient its government relations efforts to deal with multiple Washington offices rather than one. I won’t go into all the problems caused in Nashville by this strategy, but suffice to say, Nashville has not benefitted from the redistricting, and neither has anyone else in Tennessee, except Republican candidates.
Missouri is about to do the same thing to Kansas City, breaking up its largest city and economic engine for strictly partisan electoral advantage, and in that case, essentially disenfranchising a large Black population from federal representation.
Hopefully, this idea will be nipped in the bud. No one should want the University of Louisville to have three representatives, none of whom would consider that institution a priority if they also represented Western Kentucky University or Morehead. It’s true that Louisville’s critical airport has only one representative, but how much interest would someone have in that critical facility if they also represented Bowling Green or Owensboro? Similar examples are numerous.
Louisville has never had a Black representative in Congress, but Black voters have a decisive impact on who represents them in Congress. That would not be the case if the district is sliced apart. It is a certainty that such a plan would be challenged in court on racial discrimination grounds.
Most Americans don’t like gerrymandering, which serves nothing but partisan electoral ambitions. They believe, as I do, that voters should choose their politicians; politicians should not choose their voters. I am less and less optimistic that today’s Kentucky Republican officials will consider the public interest, but hope springs eternal.

Senate passes bill allowing the Treasury Dept. to waive interest on budget impasse loans,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/pa-senate-passes-bill-allowing-the-treasury-dept-to-waive-interest-on-budget-impasse-loans/,"Two Democrats, Sens. Lisa Boscola (D-Northampton) and Marty Flynn (D-Lackawanna), joined every Republican in supporting the measure.","The Pennsylvania Capitol (Peter Hall/Capital-Star)It’s been 100 days since the deadline for Pennsylvania lawmakers to pass a budget. In that time, counties, school districts and the organizations contracted to provide safety net services have been unable to receive state funds.
Last month, Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who is the leading candidate in the Republican gubernatorial primary, offered a stopgap solution in the form of low-interest loans to county governments and head start programs. It has since been expanded to domestic violence prevention and rape survivor support groups.
On Wednesday, the Senate passed a bill that would allow her department to forgive the interest on those loans.
Two Democrats, Sens. Lisa Boscola (D-Northampton) and Marty Flynn (D-Lackawanna), joined every Republican in supporting the measure.
Democrats argued that the treasurer’s office does not have the authority to loan money, and can  only make investments. They also said that the program, as instituted, has selectively helped some affected by the shutdown, like Head Start programs and county governments, at the expense of others, like school districts.
Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia), minority chair of the Appropriations Chair, said instead of authorizing no-interest loans, the Senate should instead pass a compromise budget negotiated with the Democrat-controlled House.
House Democrats have lined up votes on yet another proposed budget bill Wednesday afternoon, which will kick it back to the Senate. The latest proposal is expected to have a smaller total spend number than their previous proposal in an effort to compromise with Republicans.
“The treasury’s essentially illegal program does not have to be addressed, does not have to be considered, if we just adopt the budget that will be coming over,” Hughes said.
Republicans, however, defended the measure as a way to ensure the treasury has that authority and alleviate the impacts of the budget impasse on county governments and social service providers.
“If we had a budget, they’d have the money,” said Sen. President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland). “So I don’t know how we ask them to pay interest on something they should already have in their coffers. It just seems pretty common sense.”
As it stands, the 4.5% interest rates on loans from Garrity’s office has meant some eligible providers were unable to take advantage of the loans. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence last week that the $5.8 million loan they were authorized for would result in $260,000 in interest, making it untenable.
In a statement, the group called on lawmakers to pass legislation allowing interest-free loans during the budget impasse.
The bill would have to be passed by the House and signed by Gov. Josh Shapiro to take effect.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4184-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-08 15:58:01.105250

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Former President Joe Biden is coming to Nebraska next month for the Democratic state party’s top annual fundraising event. 
It will be one of the few public appearances for Biden since he dropped out of the 2024 presidential election amid concerns from party leaders over his electability following a debate performance against then-former President Donald Trump.
While Biden visited the state in 2017 and 2019, he never visited Nebraska during his 2020 campaign or presidency, breaking a streak of presidents making appearances in the state. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff went to Omaha for Biden before he dropped out. 
Presidential hopeful Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year announced a visit to Nebraska in November. This continues the trend of prominent Democratic figures making their way to the heartland – particularly Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, where it is likely the open seat will decide which party controls the U.S. House for the next two years.

Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders launched his “Fighting Oligarchy” nationwide tour in Omaha. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz hosted a Democratic town hall earlier this year, and former Texas U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke had a similar town hall in August. 
The 2nd District’s single presidential electoral vote has swung from Republican to Democratic in recent years, most recently to former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.  Nebraska could regain the national spotlight in 2026 with the open seat and Dan Osborn’s nonpartisan Senate bid against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. 
The midterms are emerging as crucial for the state Democratic party as it tries to find an opening. The events with prominent Democratic figures appear aimed at energizing the Nebraska Democratic base for the midterms, and come when two federal races could be competitive.  
The party has had some recent successes, including Democrat John Ewing Jr.’s defeat of three-term GOP incumbent Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert earlier this year. The party is looking to win a congressional seat for the first time since former U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford in 2017 and make gains in the Nebraska  Legislature, where Republicans have gained a legislative supermajority.

After nearly two weeks of picketing, unionized workers at the Dairy Farmers of America plant in St. Albans City came to a new contract agreement with their employer Tuesday. The length of their strike, and difficulties with negotiations, shed light on how federal cuts may result in drawn out labor negotiations. 
Members of the Teamsters Local 597 union left their work posts and took to the picket line Sept. 25 after attempting to negotiate with the dairy giant since June. Their cause drew the support of Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, who visited the picket line and offered to personally get involved in negotiations. 
Before the strike headed into its second week, union organizer Curtis Clough estimated the facility was running at about 10% capacity. He also said transport trucks were dumping thousands of gallons of milk because the facility couldn’t accept the product.

After Rodgers expressed support for the teamsters and the facility went shorthanded for almost two full weeks, the dairy company leveled with the union. 
“This new contract supports our employees and their families with competitive wages and benefits,” the company wrote in a Tuesday statement Tuesday. 
Employees will return to work, the company said in its statement. Clough sees the agreement as a win. 
“I really view it as a very solid contract full of benefits and language enhancements for the members,” he said.

Under the new contract, employees will see a 14.5% increase in wages within the next 22 months and some will see higher increases in pay depending on seniority. The new contract also prevents management from forcing overtime on employees and requires the employer to contribute more toward workers’ health care and pension plans. 
“One of the big sticking points in negotiations was always the 12-hour days in the lab,” Clough said. Now those are no more. 
Though both sides reached a resolution, Clough said it’s likely the strike would have been completely averted if federal labor mediators were involved.
In the union’s past negotiations with the dairy company, a federal mediator from Albany or Boston would get involved in the conversation and help everyone come to an agreement, Clough said. In three different instances, a strike was averted because mediators helped both sides find common ground, he said. 
But those mediators were fired this spring in a round of cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 
DOGE, notorious for exaggerating its savings, slashed positions across the Federal Labor Mediation and Conciliation Service earlier this year. Those cuts are estimated to make up 0.0014% of the federal budget, according to The Guardian. 
Teamsters felt the effects. 
“This time, with the mediators being eliminated as part of the DOGE cuts, that option (of mediation) wasn’t there,” Clough said. 
Even though the picket carried on for longer, teamsters held out. 
“They stood up to a big titan and won,” Clough said.

After that, it would go for approval to Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has indicated a desire to see it proceed. 
In August, Ferguson rejected a recommendation to approve the Carriger Solar project from the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council.
While he found the project “consistent with state policies,” he wanted the council to talk further with Yakama Nation leaders about their concerns for protecting cultural resources on and around the proposed location.
Ferguson gave the council 60 days to report back, but did not direct any specific changes to a site certification agreement between the developer and the state. This resulted in a revised agreement that the council will consider in a special meeting Oct. 21. If it is approved, it will go to the governor.
There’s one substantive change. Cypress Creek Renewables, the firm behind the energy project, will provide $100,000 in grant funding to the Yakama Nation Cultural Resources Program for continued documentation of the archaeological and historical properties “in the vicinity” of the project. The money must be paid within the first 10 years of the project’s operation.
The company supports the revised agreement and providing the grant funds, said Angeli Chandler, the firm’s director of communications.
She said there’d been “years of careful planning and siting to avoid impacts to environmental or cultural resources.” 
Yakama Nation officials who’ve opposed the project could not be immediately reached Tuesday.
Cypress Creek Renewables, based in Santa Monica, California, wants to build the solar farm north of State Route 142 along Knight Road, about two miles west of Goldendale in unincorporated Klickitat County. 
As envisioned, it will have 160 megawatts of solar generating potential, enough to power up to 32,500 homes, according to the company website. The project, which also includes a 63 megawatt battery energy storage system, will tie into the Bonneville Power Administration transmission system.
It would occupy 1,326 acres within a 2,108-acre development site that is mostly agricultural and rural residential lands. That footprint includes all solar arrays, battery storage facilities, operations and maintenance building, employee parking, and access roads.
The revised agreement requires fencing and solar panels be pushed farther from the state route, Knight Road and parcels managed by the state Department of Natural Resources adjacent to the project. There also must be additional natural screening, such as earthen berms, rock piles, or native vegetation, on the north side of those state-owned parcels.
It also requires that tribal access to traditional and cultural properties is maintained during construction.
In conversations since late August, Yakama Nation leaders reiterated their concerns about the project and sought significant changes in mitigation measures that did not get included in the proposed revised agreement.
For example, the tribe said the council should not allow installation of solar panels in the northern portion of the project area, rather than rely on setbacks and natural screening to minimize the visibility of the panels. If the council allowed panels in that area, it should first conduct a full environmental impact study, the tribe said.
Tribal leaders also insist there will be disruptions to traditional cultural properties.
Ferguson, in August, found little fault with much of the siting council’s handiwork and stressed the importance of acting rapidly enough for project developers to secure federal clean energy tax credits before they are ended by the Trump administration. Solar and wind projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, to fully qualify for the credits, he wrote.
“These tax credits are critical to ensure not only that the project remains financially viable, but that the energy it generates will remain affordable for Washingtonians,” he wrote the council in August.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/solar-panel-2.jpg,,,2025-10-08 15:58:01.105250

(Photo of Creston High School courtesy of the Union County Assessor's Office; social-media posts are sourced from exhibits in U.S. District Court files)A high school English teacher from Creston, facing termination for a social-media comment regarding the killing of Charlie Kirk, is fighting back, citing a series of pro-Republican posts by the superintendent.
Teacher Melissa Crook has filed a lawsuit against the Creston Community School District, its superintendent and the school board, claiming her First Amendment rights are being violated and seeking an injunction blocking her dismissal.
As part of her lawsuit, Crook is citing numerous political and religious social-media posts allegedly made by Creston Community School District Superintendent Deron Stender over the past five years and by school board president Don Gee.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In some of the posts, the superintendent has allegedly questioned the rights of immigrants; voiced support for Republicans including President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa; referred to former Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican critic of Trump, as a “snake;” and called backers of former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, “snowflakes.”
Stender said Wednesday he cannot comment on his social-media posts, calling them a “personnel matter” that was handled by the school board. He also declined to comment on Crook’s lawsuit, calling it a separate personnel matter. Gee also declined to comment on either his posts or the lawsuit.
In her lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, Crook, who has taught English for the Creston district since 2022, alleges she has been “subjected to retaliation, and is now threatened with the termination of her continuing-teaching contract, because of a private, off-duty comment on Facebook.”
Her Sept. 10, 2025, comment was made in response to a family member’s Facebook post about the shooting death of Kirk, a controversial, conservative political activist. The lawsuit states that “at her home, on her personal time, and using her personal Facebook account, Crook wrote, ‘He is a terrible human being … terrible. I do not wish death on anyone, but him not being here is a blessing.’”
Within a few hours, the lawsuit alleges, a conservative blog, the Iowa Standard, reported on Crook’s comment, identifying her by name and by her status as a public-school teacher working for the Creston district. The next morning, after seeing how others had perceived her original comment, Crook wrote on Facebook that she did “not wish anyone death” and apologized.
Later that morning, she issued a more extensive apology on her own Facebook page, stating: “I want to clarify a statement I made yesterday. I do NOT condone violence or the killing of people you disagree with politically or otherwise. That was never my intent. That is not who I am, nor what I believe. I believe strongly in the freedom of speech which also means I can disagree. I do not treat others poorly or wish them any harm because we do not agree … I am sorry I have offended people in this community believing that I condone killing others. I did not think he should be killed. After further review, I should have thought more about how I chose to post my thoughts, how it would sound. I take responsibility for the poor wording of my post.”
Also that day, Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley, a Republican, took to Facebook to post his thoughts on the matter, writing, “I have been made aware of social-media posts by teachers in Iowa praising the assassination of Charlie Kirk. This hate has no place in our state and certainly does not belong in our schools. My expectation is that each school district will follow the proper protocol to investigate these posts and reprimand the posters appropriately. Individuals with this depravity cannot continue to hold a position with any level of influence over our children. If appropriate action is not taken, you can trust that the Iowa House Government Oversight Committee will address this issue and take action to root out this hate from our schools.”
School district launches investigation of Crook
Two hours after Grassley commented, the lawsuit alleges, Stender, Creston’s superintendent, called Crook into a meeting and asked her multiple times about her meaning and intent in the use of the word “blessing.” At the conclusion of the meeting, the superintendent placed Crook on administrative leave pending the outcome of a district investigation.
Four days after the shooting, on Sept. 14, Stender allegedly issued a public statement that said, “I want to be clear: Personal views have no place in the instruction of our children,” adding that there was a law enforcement presence in the schools as a “precautionary measure.”
One day later, on Sept. 15, Stender allegedly called Crook into a meeting to report that the district’s investigation had concluded. Stender reported the district had received more than 111 emails and 140 telephone calls, with the vast majority of them asking for Crook’s firing or asking that their children be removed from her classroom.
According to the lawsuit, the report also alleged that Crook’s comment “resulted in the need to increase law enforcement presence out of fear for our students, staff, and school safety.”
On Sept. 25, Stender delivered to Crook a formal notice of his recommendation to terminate her teaching contract. The lawsuit alleges the notice claimed that her Facebook comment had “resulted in threats to safety of students and staff, causing a significant and adverse impact on district operations and the educational process.”
Crook then requested a hearing on the matter before the school board. According to the lawsuit, that hearing is now scheduled for Oct. 21, 2025.
Lawsuit cites posts by superintendent, board president
In one exhibit attached to her lawsuit, Crook includes a 43-page document displaying social-media posts allegedly written by Stender over the past several years, and notes that he “has made at least one Facebook post agreeing with Charlie Kirk.” The lawsuit also claims Stender and Gee, the school board president, have each “made at least one Facebook post or comment agreeing with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis asserting that in Florida, individuals have the right to hit other people with their cars” — a reference to DeSantis saying people, if they feel threatened, could drive over protesters.
The exhibit suggests Stender has made and shared political posts on a Twitter account he also used for school purposes, including content supporting Trump, Ernst and other Republicans; content condemning the “liberal media;” comments about “riots in liberal cities;” a post about supporters of former President Biden being “snowflakes;” and one comment stating, “if you don’t like America, leave with Bruce Springsteen and the other elites.”
Two separate posts attributed to Stender also called on Iowans to “vote for Ernst” and to “vote Ernst on November 3.”
In one of his alleged posts, Stender reminded district employees of an upcoming election and asked them to be “mindful of the boundaries of political expression during contract hours.”
The posts also include one from November 2020, allegedly from Stender to the district staff, in which he says, “I apologize if my personal tweets offended you, our students or the community.”
Crook’s lawsuit also includes as an exhibit social-media posts and shares by Gee, the school board president, that question “liberal” positions on free speech and contrasting the response to Kirk’s death, depicted by people in embraced in prayer, with the response to the death of George Floyd, depicted by burning buildings, looters and a person holding a “Black Lives Matter” sign. Floyd, who was Black, was killed by a white police officer in Minnesota who knelt on Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd lay face down in the street. The officer was later convicted of murder.
Gee also is alleged to have posted an immigration-related comment condemning what he called “bull— left-wing judges,” and to have reposted a meme circulated by conservative musician Ted Nugent. The meme shows a smiling school student with the caption, “My teacher told me guns kill people … I told her my pencil failed my math exam.”
Lawsuit: Rumors of a threat not substantiated
The same day Stender notified Crook of his recommendation that she be fired, the lawsuit alleges, Crook’s union representative went to the Creston Police Department and Union County Sheriff’s Office to obtain copies of any law enforcement reports related to the district since Sept. 11, 2025.
According to the lawsuit, police officials were unable to find any reports related to the district and a representative of the sheriff’s office said that office received only one call related to a comment by a teacher and that call related to the East Union Community School District.
The sheriff also indicated that Stender had called his office to report rumors of possible violence that were investigated by the district and were determined to lack credibility, the lawsuit alleges.
“More than one employee noted that any disruption (in the schools) was caused by a lack of coverage for the work of the English department, and students asking when Ms. Crook would return,” the lawsuit claims. “Several employees noted the presence of law enforcement on campus as the only event akin to disruption and questioned the need for such presence given they were informed there was no actual threat.”
Crook’s lawsuit seeks punitive damages for violations of her First Amendment rights, as well as an injunction that would restrain the board from further action related to her placement on leave and pending termination.
The school district has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-08 19:27:45+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,DiZoglio misfires in attack on attorney general,Jerold Duquette and Lawrence Friedman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/dizoglio-misfires-in-attack-on-attorney-general/,MASSACHUSETTS STATE AUDITOR Diana DiZoglio recently called in to Boston Public Radio and accused Attorney General Andrea Campbell of “working with the legislative leaders to block the audit that the […],"MASSACHUSETTS STATE AUDITOR Diana DiZoglio recently called in to Boston Public Radio and accused Attorney General Andrea Campbell of “working with the legislative leaders to block the audit that the Commonwealth voted for to the tune of 72 percent.” She further claimed that the 12 percent increase to Campbell’s fiscal year 2026 budget is a bid by the Legislature to reward her for declining to represent the auditor in litigation to compel legislative cooperation with her efforts to audit the House and Senate pursuant to last fall’s ballot question. 
For her part, Attorney General Campbell maintains that the budget increase reflects the anticipated costs of litigation over the reach of Trump administration policies, a view supported by both House Speaker Ron Mariano, who said the additional funding will allow Campbell “to push back against any unilateral, unconstitutional actions from the Trump administration,” and Senate President Karen Spilka, who in May argued that the AG should be armed “with every dollar she needs to fight the lawlessness of the Trump administration.”  
Given the patent threats to the Commonwealth posed by any number of the Trump administration’s policies, the need to supply the Office of the Attorney General with additional resources to address these threats seems almost too obvious to doubt.  
In fact, there is no evidence that the AG is colluding with legislative leaders to prevent implementation of the will of the voters who approved Question 1, the ballot question that DiZoglio championed. Campbell has consistently stated that her office continues to wait on more detailed information from the auditor regarding the specific extent of the audit she has in mind. Campbell’s position is no makeweight: The scope and reach of the audit that DiZoglio has publicly claimed the power to pursue raises serious constitutional issues.  
Indeed, the auditor responded to the attorney general’s deliberative approach to the exercise of her own powers by suggesting that Campbell sue her office “if she needs to get access to documents.”  
Perhaps needless to say, that is not how the relationship between the attorney general’s office and the other executive branch entities works: It is the attorney general who possesses the statutory discretion to determine when a lawsuit on behalf of another part of the executive branch is appropriate, and the responsibility of the part seeking representation to supply the factual details necessary to inform the attorney general’s decision.   
By simply reporting publicly that her decision cannot be made until she receives more information from the auditor, the AG is appropriately exercising her discretion, unbowed by the unsubstantiated aspersions the auditor has cast on her, her office, and anyone who has requested that she be clear about how she views the limits of her new statutory authority.  
The auditor’s accusations ignore the fact that the attorney general is not just an independent constitutional officer, but the only officer empowered to bring suit on behalf of the Commonwealth and its departments. In other words, the AG operates under a distinct constitutional mandate: The obligation to put before a court only those assertions of state authority that she plausibly can defend.  
A request of a department that seeks representation for the information necessary to make this determination is the least we should expect before an attorney general initiates litigation—particularly when that litigation implicates critical questions about the structure of government in the Commonwealth. 
Unlike Auditor DiZoglio, the AG is not at liberty to ignore the considerable evidence provided by multiple experts in two separate legislative hearings on Beacon Hill, that the legislative audit authority granted by Question 1 is unconstitutional.  
At the first hearing, conducted by the Special Joint Committee on Initiative Petitions on March 26, 2024, every expert witness testified against the constitutionality of granting the auditor’s office legislative audit authority.  
DiZoglio dismissed the views of these experts, claiming that they had been “cherry picked” by legislative leaders, and that, as the auditor, she was the most credible source of the relevant expertise. At the same time, she did not cite or produce any experts who agreed with her, and she apparently was not aware that her immediate predecessor, Suzanne Bump, opposed giving legislative audit authority to the state auditor’s office. 
DiZoglio declined even to appear at the second hearing, held on April 2, 2025, before a Senate subcommittee tasked with exploring the constitutional implications of a legislative audit. Among the issues covered was, for example, the extent to which an audit could interfere with the separation of powers and the constitutional authority of each chamber of the Legislature to set its own rules.  
Expert witnesses pointed out that the constitution expressly grants each chamber the power to make rules and control its own proceedings, and that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that this authority “is a continuous power absolute and beyond the challenge of any other tribunal.” The testimony made clear that an audit into any aspect of the ways in which either chamber of the Legislature chooses to conduct itself could in multiple ways intrude upon the settled constitutional authority of each to manage its own affairs.  
At the end of the day, Campbell’s reluctance to run to court in support of the auditor makes sense: As she herself noted, based upon the limited details DiZoglio has shared about the audit she has planned, a judge likely “would laugh [her] out of court.”  
The auditor is trapped in a legal box of her own making. This is, at least in part, because her goals and claims have from the start been more politically compelling than legally persuasive. She has consistently downplayed the legal and constitutional implication of the authority she sought. 
Now, by insisting that the real barrier to implementing the people’s will is political deal-making and collusion among the AG, legislative leaders, and the latter’s “cherry picked” experts, DiZoglio can soldier on with her crusade against Beacon Hill’s power brokers in the court of public opinion without having to confront the looming reality of judicial review and what will likely be a disappointing end to the fight in which she has invested so much.

(Courtesy of Doña Ana County)Those who suffered damage or losses in floods this summer in Lincoln or Doña Ana counties have seven days to apply for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
President Donald Trump on July 22 declared a presidential disaster in Lincoln County, a couple of weeks after storms, floods and landslides devastated the area in and around Ruidoso. Then FEMA in mid-August announced that Doña Ana County residents could also qualify for aid. The damage must have occurred between June 23 and Aug. 5. 
The declaration empowers FEMA to provide various types of emergency assistance to individuals and families, including funding for housing, lost essentials and more. The deadline to apply for that funding is Oct. 15.

FEMA individual assistance is typically limited only to those who don’t have adequate or any insurance to cover their losses, and it is typically limited to, at most, about $40,000 under the federal Stafford Act. 
According to FEMA data, 500 individuals or households have been approved for at least some FEMA help totaling about $6.7 million. That includes about $4.35 million for housing assistance.
Oct. 15 is also the deadline to apply for companies affected in the disasters to apply for special loans the Small Business Administration offers. 
The state’s emergency management department issued a reminder to affected families Wednesday about the upcoming deadline. 
In addition to the funding for individuals, public entities like local governments in Lincoln, Doña Ana and Otero counties, along with the Mescalero Apache Tribe, are eligible for FEMA reimbursement for most of the costs of responding to the disaster. So far, FEMA has approved about $3.3 million for those entities, according to FEMA data. 
The post-fire flooding in Lincoln County on July 9 caused the deaths of three people — a father and his two children — and caused other chaos in a mountain village still recovering from the South Fork and Salt fires in summer 2024. 
The floods required the rescues of dozens of people and swept away homes and cars. On July 22, monsoon rains in the deserts of Doña Ana flooded the colonias of Vado around the Rio Grande, flooding at least 110 homes and wrecking infrastructure.
FEMA officials recommend applying for assistance online in English or Spanish, or using the agency’s mobile app. The agency can also be reached on its helpline at (800)621-3362. 
The agency also operates two offices that people can visit in both counties. Both centers will be open Monday, which is Indigenous Peoples’ Day, with regular hours.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-at-8.39.51 AM-1024x499.png,,,2025-10-08 15:58:01.105250

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For the sixth consecutive year, Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport has been ranked among the top 10 airports in the nation by Condé Nast Traveler.
The Warwick airport tied for ninth place with Salt Lake City International Airport in Utah in the London-based magazine’s annual Readers’ Choice Awards. Last year, T.F. Green ranked seventh in the nation.
Rankings were based on reader surveys submitted between April and June, evaluating criteria such as amenities and convenience, according to the magazine.
Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport in Georgia won the top honor, followed by Portland International Airport in Oregon and Tampa International Airport in Florida.
T.F. Green was the only New England airport to appear in Condé Nast’s Top 10 rankings.
Condé Nast Traveler called T.F. Green a “great little airport” that’s easy to reach and to navigate, with more than two-thirds of New England’s population living within a 75-minute drive to the airport. 
“Long favored by budget carriers as a less expensive alternative to Boston Logan, the airport has been growing steadily in recent years and is well-positioned to benefit from a resurgence in domestic air travel,” the magazine notes.
Airport officials flaunted their status as the “fastest-growing major U.S. airport,” citing 2024 federal data ranking T.F. Green above Philadelphia International Airport and Washington-Dulles International Airport for passenger and seat growth.
Between 2023 and 2024, T.F. Green saw a 10% increase in flights coming in and out of the airport, according to data compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
In all, T.F. Green reported 64,972 flight operations for 2023. The following year saw 71,992 flights.
As of Oct. 8, the FAA recorded 50,502 in and out of Warwick for 2025.
The airport has also undergone major modernization updates in recent years funded by federal grants, passenger fees and airport funds. That includes the installation of automated coffee machines, new restaurants, colossal welcome signs off Interstate 95, and $10 million toward marble-lined bathrooms.
Officials are planning an additional $64 million overhaul to the terminal — though it also comes with the potential loss of its iconic decorative sailboat near the baggage claim.
In a statement Tuesday, airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said T.F. Green’s consistent placement on Condé Nast’s list “further highlights the airport’s commitment to providing exceptional service and a seamless travel experience for passengers.”
“With an expanding network of airlines and destinations, Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport continues to strengthen its reputation as a key hub in the region,” Fischer said.
Earlier this year, Travel + Leisure Magazine readers named T.F. Green the No. 1 airport in America during its 2025 World’s Best Awards.

Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University, endorsed Democratic candidate Bridget Brink on his way out the door.
“I’ve made the tough decision to suspend my congressional campaign for Michigan’s 7th District,” Cowen said in a Facebook reel. “We raised more than $200,000 from 1,600 donors in just three months. We picked up endorsements from unions, local leaders and statewide officials, and I’m so proud of that and grateful to all of you. But if you know me, you know I believe in data and in facts, and the facts are that we won’t be able to compete the way we need to, to stay in this time.”

Cowen said he wanted to serve as the congressman representing Michigan families in the Capitol area, and that his campaign was never about him. One of his main goals was to also help Democrats take back the U.S. House in 2026, and he said his best way to help make that happen was by pulling out of the race.
The Democratic nominee will eventually face incumbent U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte).
That said, Cowen told his supporters that he was now endorsing Brink, the former ambassador to Ukraine. The Brink campaign also circulated an endorsement email on Wednesday notifying voters of the news.
“Bridget has an extraordinary record of public service for our country. She was a public school graduate, and the daughter of a public school teacher and MEA member,” Cowen said in a statement from the Brink campaign. “She has made a commitment to protect public schools throughout her campaign – and when she gets to Congress. Maybe most importantly, I think she has the best chance of beating Tom Barrett, which is exactly why I am supporting her today.”
Brink said she was honored to have Cowen’s support.

“Josh ran a principled campaign focusing on what matters most for mid-Michigan families – a bright future for our kids with great public schools and lower costs for families,” Brink said in a statement. “I know what a champion he is for public education and ensuring opportunity for all of our kids. I’m excited to have Josh on our side in the fight to tackle the high cost of living, invest in public education, protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and fight like hell for our Democratic values. There’s so much at stake for Michigan families right now, and our campaign to stand up to the Trump Administration and defeat Tom Barrett will be a team effort – and we’re just getting started.”
Cowen said he wasn’t out of the fight for better schools and a stronger democracy even though he was no longer a candidate for the 7th District.
“I love our country and believe it can be made better and more perfect for all of us,” Cowen said. “I’ll have more to say about my next steps soon.”
Former Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam, Alexandra Prieditis, Elyon Badger and Muhammed Salman Rais are also seeking the Democratic nomination in the 7th District race.

Free.,"Air traffic control staffing steady, but stress during shutdown worries DOT",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/air-traffic-control-staffing-steady-stress-during-shutdown-worries-dot,,"The Federal Aviation Administration reported no travel delays due to staffing levels at U.S. air traffic control facilities Wednesday, following a day of some delays related to above-average absences at a handful of facilities.An FAA operational plan posted about noon Eastern Time on Wednesday, the eighth day of the federal government shutdown, showed no facilities impacted by “staffing triggers.” A day earlier, the same memo showed staffing levels affected operations at major hub airports in Phoenix and Denver, as well as a smaller airport in Burbank, California.Air traffic controllers are essential to the functioning of the nation’s air transportation system and must continue to work during a shutdown, though they are not paid while it is ongoing.The group has not yet missed a paycheck during the current lapse in federal funding. The first impact most federal employees will see on their pay will be Friday, when electronic funding transfers are made for the pay period from Sept. 24 to Oct. 7. Because Congress has no appropriated money beyond Sept. 30, they would only receive a partial paycheck. Future paychecks would not be allocated until the government reopens.‘How am I going to pay my mortgage?’ The possibility of working without pay is stressful for air traffic controllers, possibly leading to worsening performance or motivating some to call in sick to work on-demand jobs such as driving for ridesharing services, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a Monday press conference in Newark, New Jersey.“Now what they think about as they’re patrolling our airspace is, ‘How am I going to pay my mortgage? How do I make my car payment? I have a couple kids at home, how do I put food on the table? I’m working six days a week, do I have to take a second job and drive Uber?’” Duffy said.Duffy said there was a slight uptick in controllers calling in sick, but that it had not been widespread. Extensive “sick-outs” among air traffic controllers were a major factor in ending the last partial government shutdown, which occurred during President Donald Trump’s first presidency in 2018. “Absenteeism as a concern: We've had a few airports and we're tracking it,” Duffy responded to a reporter who asked about the issue. “We don't have one facility that has had long-term issues with sick leave, but that is concerning to me. And if someone has to take sick leave to drive Uber to make the difference … of course that's concerning for us.”Union chief calls for reopening governmentNick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said on a CBS Evening News interview Tuesday the union is not coordinating absenteeism and is encouraging members to stay on the job during the shutdown. Air traffic controllers are prohibited by law from striking or taking other actions to disrupt the air transportation system.Daniels also called on Congress to reopen the government as soon as possible to ease the strain on the workforce.“There is no concerted effort for air traffic controllers to go in and somehow impede this system,” Daniels said. “But what it shouldn’t be is waiting to see how long air traffic controllers can last.”",,,,2025-10-08 14:56:38.203609

“It’s a community museum, and heavy on the ‘community’, and so that means it belongs to you,” Heather R. Lawson, chairwoman of the Ebony Horsewomen, Inc. board of directors, said through the microphone as she faced the group of adults and Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School students sitting in chairs on the lawn.
The museum commemorates the first African American woman to work for the U.S. Postal Service, as well as the history of the Black equestrian, horsewomen and men across the country. It serves as a cultural landmark and archival center in the city’s North End.

Historians and anthropologists have studied the exclusion of African Americans in the Wild West cowboy and rodeo history. Lawson said the museum aims to fill the gap of this erasure.
“A lot of people made up the fabric of America, and there’s a lot of history to be told. Some of it is more mainstream, and many of us know about it, and some is a little bit more hidden, but it’s worth seeking out the knowledge so that you can see yourself as part of America’s story,” Lawson said.
During the ceremony, organizers acknowledged everyone who took part in building the museum since Patricia E. Kelly, president of Ebony Horsewomen, wrote a grant request in 2017 seeking financing for the project.
Founded by Kelly in 1984, Ebony Horsewomen, Inc. has spent over 40 years serving youth, families, and veterans with equine therapy and cultural programs, through the bond of humans and horses.
“Mary Fields was a woman of extreme courage, extreme resilience, and who had a lot of grit, and that kind of embodies everything that we do here at Ebony Horsewomen,” Lawson said.
After Fields’ monologue “Mary Speaks” was performed, attendees toured the inside of the museum and the horse stables.

Curated by Levi Robinson, the 1,400-square-foot museum presents the triumphs, losses and ties that bind Black communities to horse culture. In the center of a large room with walls covered in old western artifacts, interactive digital screens, paintings and photos is a life-sized statue of Fields standing beside a horse and carriage.
Fields’ history is curated through the first few walls, but further into the museum are  photos of the Buffalo Soldiers, African American soldiers who served in the U.S. Army in the late 19th and early 20th century. There are also contemporary important Black equestrian figures like national champion Mikhail Proctor, and Shariah Harris, the first Black woman to compete in a U.S. Open women’s polo championship. 
As the museum reclaims the presence of African American experience, history and impact during pioneer times, on the range and stables, it is also home to Ebony’s own history in Hartford and across the country. Along the walls hang photos of Ebony horsewomen tournaments, with community members hoping to keep adding more local stories.
“Being a resident of Hartford, I think having history, especially Black history, is really important to teach to our young ones, and I think having something like this museum in our community is very special,” Javan Campbell, a member of the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School staff, said.

Many of his students were curious and intrigued about what Ebony is and what the museum entails. Some knew about the organization through their summer programs, but others did not. What was common among all of them, was their amazed gazes when walking through the entrance of the ceremony while six horses ridden by Keney Park’s Mounted Patrols saluted them.
Quamel Smith was one of those on mounted patrols at the entrance. He has been a park ranger for 20 years, taking care of the park, of the horses and now being a mentor for younger kids of the neighborhood.
“Ebony Horsewomen and the museum are a safe place for the inner city kids that grow up around here like me,” Smith said.

Nydin Maldonado used to ride at Ebony when she was a teenager, but stopped right after graduating high school. Now, as a 32-year-old woman, she began to ride again at Ebony as a birthday present, and became an advisory board member.
“Ebony is right in the city, and I think that’s one thing that makes it more special, you see barns and this kind of community and other cities that aren’t built like the North End of Hartford, but because of Ms. Kelly, like, we all have access to beautiful horses and now to the history with the museum,” Maldonado said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Connie Beal: Let’s focus on solutions — 45,000 Vermonters don’t have to lose health insurance  .","This commentary is by Connie Beal, of St. Albans. Beal is the director of United Way’s Working Bridges program, which helps working individuals and families reach stability and thrive. Working Bridges is a partnership between United Way and employers focused on helping employees access the resources they need to gain, keep and grow stable employment by bringing services and support directly to employees onsite at the workplace.


Many in our community have expressed understandable fear and dismay at the reported estimate that 45,000 Vermonters will lose their health insurance because of the federal bill signed into law on July 4. However, this outcome is far from inevitable. 
While some Vermonters might lose health coverage under the new law due to being ineligible, many more could lose coverage simply because they cannot complete the process of recertification or navigate available health insurance options.
Many of us know from our own experience how overwhelming and confusing it can be to navigate health insurance options, and this law will only make it harder. For example, the law imposes new requirements for people on Medicaid to prove they are working to receive coverage, and their eligibility will need to be recertified every six months instead of once a year. The law also adds hurdles for people who purchase coverage on the commercial marketplace by making it harder to sign up, shrinking enrollment periods and decreasing financial assistance available through advanced premium tax credits.

United Way’s Working Bridges program is uniquely positioned to meet this moment. Working Bridges is a partnership between United Way and employers whereby trained resource coordinators meet with employees in their workplace to help them navigate and access the resources they need to keep and grow stable employment. Working Bridges Resource Coordinators are certified health assisters and already work with employees at 30 workplaces in Northern Vermont. 
Working Bridges health assisters can support employees as they navigate this new landscape and help employers understand and respond to new requirements. We can help employees stay healthy and support employers to not have to shoulder this burden alone.  
This is about protecting access to health care for our families, friends, colleagues and neighbors — but it’s also about the health of Vermont’s workforce and economy. People will not stop getting sick or needing care if they do not have health coverage. They will either end up getting care in a more expensive setting (driving up health care costs for all of us) or they will get sicker and be unable to work and support their families.  
Let’s devise a solutions-focused strategy to ensure Vermonters who are eligible for Medicaid maintain their health coverage, and Vermonters get good information about health insurance options and have trusted, accessible resources to rely on as these changes are put in place. This includes organizations and programs that already provide health assistance and health care navigation, such as Working Bridges, the Vermont Healthcare Advocate’s Office, the federally qualified health centers and others who will be on the frontlines of this health care crisis. We must collaborate to adequately resource solutions we know work in Vermont. 
For our economy to be secure and prosperous for all, I’m reminded of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Economic Bill of Rights from 1944 (often called a second Bill of Rights) as a challenge that demands our immediate attention. Especially now, as we see social safety nets as well as worker resources and protections weaken. Economic security for all includes “the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health.”

William Barber (L) (Photo: Rob Schofield)GREENVILLE — A 2024 lawsuit filed by former North Carolina NAACP leader Rev. William Barber II against AMC Theaters can proceed, U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle ruled this week, denying a motion by the movie chain to dismiss the case.
The movie chain did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Filed under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the lawsuit stems from an incident in December 2023. Barber and his elderly mother went to the AMC Fire Tower 12 theater in Greenville, NC, to see a screening of “The Color Purple.”
Barber has a disability called ankylosing spondylitis, a debilitating condition that does not allow him to sit in normal seats. For years, he has brought a taller chair with him to public and private events.
According to the lawsuit, Barber had confirmed in advance that handicapped seating was available in the theater, and had set up his chair in that area in a way that would not obstruct anyone’s view.
However, the lawsuit says, the theater employees refused to allow him the accommodation, requiring him to produce a doctor’s note to verify his condition.
When Barber refused to leave, the employees called the police. The police escorted Barber out, leaving his 90-year-old mother behind, the lawsuit says. A video of the incident, taken by an onlooker, shows Barber using two canes to leave the theater with the officer.
The lawsuit claims the movie chain’s employees violated the ADA. It says Barber was embarrassed, defamed, and discriminated against because of his disability, and seeks damages of more than $50,000.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)Florida’s agriculture commissioner said he is dedicated to addressing students’ “diet of ultra-processed foods,” particularly in Florida school lunches.
Following a report from President Donald Trump’s Make America Healthy Again Commission, Commissioner Wilton Simpson said, pending federal action, that he “is committed to defining and addressing ultra-processed foods during Florida’s upcoming legislative session.”
“I applaud President Trump’s leadership through the Make America Healthy Again Commission to address childhood nutrition and growing concerns related to ultra-processed foods,” Simpson said in a news release. “If bureaucratic games and barriers prevent federal action, we are prepared to take decisive measures here in Florida to define ultra-processed foods and protect our children’s health.”
Simpson went on to say that his office would continue to prioritize “Florida farmers’ fresh, nutritious products on school menus.”
Last session, Sen. Jon Martin, R-Fort Myers, introduced SB 1826, which would’ve defined the term “ultra-processed food” and prohibited schools from serving or selling it.
That bill was heard in the Agriculture Committee, but amid concerns from lobbyists in the food and beverage industry it died.
Martin has not yet introduced the measure, or similar language, for the legislative session beginning in January. The senator told the Phoenix on Wednesday that since initiatives in other states have gained traction, before he introduces a language he will align it with patchwork legislation in those states.
“I’m happy that after I filed the bills last year, presented two different bills on food safety and health along the lines of the MAHA movement, that many states as well as the federal government stepped up and put some restrictions in place on basically what you could call food,” Martin told the Phoenix. 
The Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture are in a rulemaking process to define ultra-processed food. That rule is in a public comment period.
His pitch to lawmakers last year was that Florida had an opportunity to lead in passing such legislation, considering the arrival of Trump’s new administration and its focus on healthier food.
“I don’t want to regulate personal choices and I don’t want to tell companies that they have to do something or that individuals have to do something, but it felt like something was broken because the choices were gone,” Martin said, sympathizing especially with those in food deserts.
What MAHA says
The MAHA assessment included research that found consuming ultra-processed foods leads to nutrient depletion and increased caloric intake, and warned against food additives.
“UPFs have allowed us to save money and to ‘eat on the run,’ but today’s over-reliance on UPFs is damaging the health of American children,” the report says.
The Trump administration cites research concluding that about 70% of 300,000 branded food products at grocery stores are ultra-processed.
The assessment focused particularly ultra-processed food’s implications for young people.
“Schools that receive federal lunch subsidies are required to follow a meal pattern that limits added sugars, sodium, and carbohydrates, but do not set limits on UPF consumption, leading to excessive intake of sugar, processed carbohydrates, processed fats, and sodium among children,” the report states.
In Congress, Rep. Mike Kennedy, R-Utah, introduced a bill that would ban schools receiving federal funding for lunches from serving ultra-processed foods.
In California, lawmakers approved a bill that would ban ultra-processed foods starting in 2035. The bill has not yet been signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The bill also would establish a definition of ultra-processed.

The lawsuit targeted a requirement that minors get parental […]","An exam room inside the Planned Parenthood in Meridian, Idaho (Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun).A lawsuit seeking to strike down Missouri laws that restrict access to abortion for minors was thrown out Tuesday on technical grounds. 
Jackson County Circuit Judge Sarah Castle determined that the nonprofit that filed the litigation, Right By You, did not have the standing to sue. The lawsuit targeted a requirement that minors get parental consent before an abortion and a ban on anyone aiding or assisting minors who are seeking an abortion. 
Castle didn’t draw any conclusions in her Tuesday decision about whether the reproductive rights amendment approved by voters last year renders either law unconstitutional. 
Missouri’s parental consent law requires a minor attempting to access abortion receive at least one parent’s consent. The other parent must also be notified. If that’s not possible, they can also ask a judge to bypass the requirement.
“Today’s victory ensures that Missouri’s parental consent laws will continue to safeguard young girls, hold abortion providers accountable and uphold the values of Missouri families for generations to come,” Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said in a statement Wednesday.  
Right By You is a nonprofit that helps young people navigate pregnancy decisions, including by increasing access to and awareness around contraceptives, prenatal care, abortion, parenting and adoption. In its lawsuit, the nonprofit also asked the court to allow the group to begin funding and arranging logistics for minors seeking abortions, including transportation, hotel and child care costs. 
But Castle on Tuesday determined Right By You, which has one employee in Illinois and some volunteers who live in Missouri,  didn’t have the ability to sue because it’s “fiscally sponsored” by a nonprofit incorporated in California. She dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, leaving the door open for the suit to be filed again.
“Young Missourians will continue to be coerced, isolated, and stigmatized for simply choosing to end a pregnancy until the abortion restrictions targeting them are lifted,” Stephanie Kraft Sheley, Right By You’s founder and director, said in a statement Wednesday. “Missouri’s youth deserve better than being left on their own just to access basic health care.”
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder and director of Right By You, poses for a portrait in April (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Kraft Sheley said attorneys may re-file the lawsuit. In the meantime, she said, Right By You will continue providing young people with information on abortion and contraception through the nonprofit’s text line.
Castle heard arguments in early September after the attorney general’s office asked the court to dismiss the case.
Peter Donohue, an assistant attorney general involved in the lawsuit, told Castle that the judicial bypass measures in place are sufficient. 
“It’s kind of wild the plaintiffs think that in cases where judicial bypass is insufficient, that they want basically no circumstance in which parents would be notified of their minor children having an abortion, essentially,” Donohue said.
Allison Zimmer, with the Lawyering Project, argued on behalf of Right By You that the lawsuit was part of a larger effort to broadly protect reproductive rights. 
“Just to go back to what is at stake here again, this is about the threat to the right to reproductive freedom,” Zimmer said. “A constitutional right for people in Missouri after the November election … “
Thirty-eight states, including Missouri, require at least some parental involvement for minors seeking abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group. 
“It makes sense that folks that are in healthy relationships with their children have this instinct that they would want their children to come to them, but a law that forces that to happen in every case is not the solution to that problem,” Kraft Sheley previously told The Independent. “Because it’s not possible for a law to legislate a healthy family dynamic.”
Kraft Sheley is also a co-founder of What’s Next, a reproductive justice group made up of organizers and activists who previously called for a constitutional amendment to appear on the Missouri ballot with no restrictions on abortion. 
Last year, the coalition called on the state’s major reproductive rights groups to challenge Missouri’s parental consent law. 
After getting no response, Kraft Sheley filed her own lawsuit, noting that current policy does not clearly state how or if minors in state custody or in the foster care system can access abortion through the current parental consent law.
Missouri attorney general subpoenas Planned Parenthood for patient abortion records

An answer to the question of constitutionality may instead come from a separate lawsuit filed in February 2024 in Cole County by the attorney general’s office alleging Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which oversees clinics in Kansas City and Columbia, illegally transported minors out of state for abortions. 
The lawsuit relied on a staged video filmed and edited by Project Veritas, a conservative news organization. In the footage, a man working with Project Veritas goes to a Kansas City area Planned Parenthood and pretends to have a 13-year-old niece who he says needs an abortion. The employee tells the man that Planned Parenthood can help the girl get an abortion in Kansas.
Planned Parenthood has said the lawsuit should be dropped because the video was based on a hypothetical situation and because abortion is now legal. 
“I find that the right to reproductive freedom initiative does not address the issue of parental consent,” Boone County Judge J. Hasbrouck Jacobs said in April. “And because of that, I’m going to deny the motion to dismiss.”
The next hearing date has not yet been set.
Missourians in November narrowly voted to enshrine the right to reproductive health care in the state constitution. This amendment includes a provision that prohibits the government from discriminating “against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care or assisting another person in doing so.” 
The amendment does allow the government to legislate abortion access if compelling governmental interest exists. 
A new amendment proposed by the Republican legislature is set to appear on the November 2026 ballot. If passed, it will repeal the reproductive rights amendment and ban nearly all abortions, with limited exceptions for survivors and for medical emergencies.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meridian-clinic-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 14:56:38.203609
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-08 17:58:38+00:00,CT Mirror,CT will continue to fund WIC food program amid government shutdown,Laura Tillman and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/08/ct-wic-government-shutdown/,"WIC, which costs about $200,000 a day to run in Connecticut and serves around 52,000 people, will continue thanks to an infusion of state funds.","Connecticut will temporarily fund a federal program to ensure that young children, along with pregnant and nursing mothers, continue to receive nutrition benefits during the government shutdown, officials said Wednesday.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, costs about $200,000 a day to run for Connecticut alone and provides food for women who are nursing or pregnant, as well as young children, serving around 52,000 people across the state and almost half of infants born in the United States.
At a press conference at a WIC enrollment site in Hartford, officials including Gov. Ned Lamont announced that the program would continue without interruption thanks to an infusion of state funds from the “common cash pool” of state operational dollars. 
“I wanted to make sure that Connecticut is one of the, sadly, very few states in the country stepping up making sure that if you’re a new mom, if you’ve got kids under the age of 5, an infant, we’re taking care of you,” Lamont said. “We’ll make sure it continues until the federal government gets its act together.”
WIC provides funding for healthy food, but the program also includes support for pregnant women and nursing, including prenatal care, and counselors to help new mothers breastfeed. WIC provides whole grains, fruit, vegetables, milk, formula, eggs and beans, among other nutritious foods.
The press conference came a day after the Trump administration announced that it will use tariff revenue to fund WIC during the shutdown. 
“The WIC program works really well,” Lamont said. “Stop injecting all this uncertainty. Look, you’re making a lot of people really nervous, starting with young moms with new infants. Get it together. You wrote ‘The Art of the Deal.’ Make a deal. Let’s end this shutdown.” 
Officials said the state expects to be repaid for WIC spending once the shutdown ends.
Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz praised Lamont for ensuring that the state has funds to draw on in such a crisis.
“I think we are very lucky to live in a state that has had fiscally responsible leadership from our governor, Ned Lamont. We are able to continue funding this program even during a federal shutdown because we’ve been fiscally responsible. We have a very large rainy day fund, and we are not going to let women and babies and children go hungry in our state.” 
SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, are expected to remain unaffected through the end of October, officials said. But the uncertainty around the duration of the shutdown has advocates in Connecticut worried about the future of these benefits that support low-income families as well as mothers and infants — and the stress it would place on their own services that are already seeing higher-than-usual demand.
The potential loss or reductions in WIC and SNAP in the next month or so would put significant stress on food banks and mobile pantries. On top of looming cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in the coming years, Jason Jakubowski of Connecticut Foodshare sees it as a “real nightmare scenario” for the hundreds of partners his group works with on food distribution throughout the state.
The demand at food banks is already high, and the lines are similar to the peak during the pandemic, even in the early days of the shutdown. Over the last two weeks, Jakubowski said, the 600 pantries his organization partners with have seen an increased demand in food, and he expects that to grow over the next week.
“There’s a sense of panic in many communities out there, not just in Connecticut but across the country. And we’re prepared for that. We’ve already seen that play out — more people coming to our mobile lines, more people going to our pantries, more people looking for more food at a time in which either the food supply has either stayed stagnant or has even decreased a little bit,” Jakubowski said in an interview.
As a proactive measure, the board of directors for Connecticut Foodshare authorized $1 million in emergency funding at its Monday meeting. The group has already started to dip into that money, but the funds will be used primarily during a prolonged shutdown.
“I think we’re all kind of scrambling right now and trying to make sure our ducks are in a row when this really does start affecting people’s pocketbooks,” Jakubowski said.
Jakubowski sees similarities with the last government shutdown that began in late 2018 and lasted more than a month into January 2019. But he said the federal funding cuts plus the coming ramifications of the “big beautiful bill” add an extra layer of uncertainty and panic in this iteration.
During the last shutdown, Connecticut Foodshare set up pop-up food distributions and pop-up mobile trucks that were stationed around the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London as well as around Bradley International Airport. TSA agents and military are considered essential during a shutdown but don’t get paid. They receive back pay once a shutdown ends.
A week into this shutdown, the nonprofit has already started to purchase additional food. And Jakubowski said he expects to deploy the same kind of interventions and services during the week of Oct. 20 if a shutdown continues through the next couple of weeks, because federal workers could start to miss their first paycheck in the next week or so.
Jakubowski said he’s already started discussions with Gemma Morgan Food Center, which is prepared to launch four mobile truck sites in southeastern Connecticut to help families with a federal employee or contractor who is furloughed or not receiving pay while working. He said the group is also preparing to work with Bradley airport again.
“Our baseline is increased demand right now. The shutdown is literally throwing fuel onto the fire,” he said.
Food aid has already taken a hit this year because of federal cutbacks. Connecticut was hit by cuts earlier this year to The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP.
About 30% of the food for food banks and pantries comes from the federal government via the TEFAP program. Because of those cuts in the spring, they lost about 35 trailer loads of food, which amounts to about 1.6 million pounds.
“We’re already dealing in an environment in which there is less food to provide people. That’s a marked difference between 2025 and in 2019,” Jakubowski said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_6950-3-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-08 14:56:38.203609

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)Xcel Energy is requesting a rate increase that would cause electric bills for the company’s average South Dakota residential customer to go up by 19%, which equates to $21 per month.
If approved by state regulators, it would be Xcel’s second increase in two years. The company attempted to raise rates by 18% in 2023, but regulators reduced that to 6%, which equated to a roughly $5 monthly increase for the average residential customer. 
Regulators reduce Xcel’s 18% electric rate hike to 6%

The company filed its latest request with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission on June 30. Xcel said it needs the increase to cover inflationary costs, upgrade infrastructure, and recover costs from investments in wind turbines, natural gas facilities and transmission lines. The rate hike would raise $43.6 million in additional annual revenue for the company.
The commission’s staff is reviewing the request and will make a recommendation later this year. If approved, the new rates would take effect no earlier than Jan. 1.
Xcel has a total of 107,000 South Dakota electrical customers in Hanson, Lake, Lincoln, McCook, Minnehaha, Moody, Sanborn and Turner counties in the southeast part of the state. Most of the customers are located in the Sioux Falls area.

Catherine Cortez Masto and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, both Democrats, as well as Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with Republicans to advance their multi-week funding bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted no.The shutdown began on Oct. 1, the start of the federal government’s 2026 fiscal year.Johnson says no separate vote on military paySpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., rejected the idea of voting on a stand-alone bill to provide paychecks to active duty military members during the shutdown, saying that if Democrats wanted to ensure salaries for federal workers, they should vote to advance the stopgap spending bill. “They live with that vote. They made that decision. The House is done,” Johnson said at a morning press conference. “The ball is now in the Senate’s court. It does us no good to be here dithering on show votes. We did it. We sent the product over.”Johnson also appeared to fully reject an idea floated by the Trump administration not to provide back pay for furloughed federal employees, which is required by a 2019 law. “It’s my understanding that the law is that they would be paid. There is some other legal analysis that’s floating around. I haven’t yet had time to dig into and read that,” Johnson said. “But it has always been the case, it is tradition and I think it is statutory law that federal employees be paid. And that’s my position. I think they should be.”

The shutdown will likely only end after congressional leaders begin talking with each other about core policy issues, including how to address enhanced tax credits for people who buy their own health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year, spurring huge increases in health insurance costs.Democrats say a deal must be reached before they’ll vote to advance the GOP stopgap spending bill that would fund the government through Nov. 21. Republican leaders maintain they won’t negotiate until after Democrats vote to open the government.‘You can’t take the federal government hostage’Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he and other GOP lawmakers are willing to talk with Democrats about the tax credits, but only after the government reopens. “They have other issues that they want to bring up, which I said before we’re happy to discuss, and yes, there are some things that I think there’s interest on both sides in trying to address when it comes to health care in this country,” Thune said. “But you can’t take the federal government hostage and expect to have a reasonable conversation on those issues.”Thune said the stopgap funding bill is needed to give both chambers more time to work out a final agreement on the dozen full-year government funding bills, which were supposed to become law by the start of the fiscal year.“What this does is provide a short-term extension in order for all that to happen,” he said. “That’s all that we’re talking about.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans are divided on health care issues and want to avoid a public debate over the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Schumer then read part of a social media post by Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in which she said she was “absolutely disgusted” that health premiums will double by the end of the year without action.“More Republicans should listen to her because, on this issue, she’s right on the money,” Schumer said. “Meanwhile, Democrats’ position hasn’t changed. We urge our Republican colleagues to join us in a serious negotiation to reopen the government and extend ACA premiums.”Trump threatsThe shutdown’s ramifications will continue to get worse the longer lawmakers remain intransigent, especially given President Donald Trump’s efforts to differentiate this funding lapse from those in the past.Trump has said he’ll lay off federal workers by the thousands, cancel funding approved by Congress for projects in Democratic regions of the country and may not provide back pay for the hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal employees.Trump and administration officials have been vague about when and how they’d implement layoffs, but a federal judge hearing arguments in a suit brought by a federal employee labor union has ordered government attorneys to file a brief later this week detailing its plans and its timeline.  Northern District of California Judge Susan Illston has given the Trump administration until the end of Friday to share details of any planned or in-progress Reduction in Force plans, “including the earliest date that those RIF notices will go out.”Illston, who was nominated by former President Bill Clinton, also told the Trump administration to detail what agencies anticipate implementing layoffs and how many employees that would impact. Illston set Oct. 16 for oral arguments between the American Federation of Government Employees and federal government attorneys over AFGE’s request for a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from implementing layoffs during the shutdown.Murkowski reports informal talksAlaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, part of a bipartisan group that has begun informal talks, said during a brief interview Wednesday that the government must reopen before real steps can be taken on the ACA tax credits. “I think the leadership has made very, very clear that the way to open up the government is, let's pass a bill that will allow us to open up the government, and then there's a lot of good conversations that can go on,” Murkowski said. “It doesn't mean that we wait until then to start conversations, and that's what we're doing. We're talking but we’re talking outside of the range of your microphones.”She said, “There are not a lot of guarantees around this place, are there?” when asked by a reporter whether Republicans could provide Democrats with assurances on floor votes on ACA tax credit extensions if they vote for the stopgap spending bill. North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis said he expects the shutdown to last for at least a couple more weeks and urged Democratic senators to vote to reopen the government. “Go take a look at the list of Democrats who are either not running for reelection or not up until ‘28 or ‘30,” Tillis said. “There are plenty of them to walk the plank like I have multiple times to get the government funded and then the discussions start.”Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin said that talks between Democrats and Republicans are “stalled” but “we’re having conversations with everybody.” South Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said that lawmakers have had bipartisan “visits” though no real conversations. “There’s no framework,” Rounds said. “There's just a matter of a clarification about how important it is to get the shutdown over with. And once we get that shutdown over with, we'll go back to bipartisan work in the Senate.”Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-08 13:57:59.369606

(Photo via Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)More than 43,000 children were disenrolled from the Florida KidCare program for nonpayment of premiums — more than double the number the state previously provided to the Florida Phoenix, a state report shows.
A report obtained by the Florida Phoenix shows 17,430 children were disenrolled from the program between Sept. 1, 2024, and Aug. 31, 2025, for failing to pay the premium. Those children never re-enrolled and may have become uninsured. 
But another 25,806 children also were briefly disenrolled from the Florida KidCare program after their family didn’t pay the required premium. Those children were re-enrolled during a 12-month period after premiums were eventually paid.
That means tens of thousands of children were removed from the health insurance program for children while the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis has tussled with U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services over a requirement that children enrolled in federally funded programs must retain eligibility for one year.
The skirmish has prevented the state from implementing a 2023 Florida law (HB 121) that increased eligibility for the program by boosting the maximum qualifying income from 200% to 300% of the federal poverty level. That’s a difference between earning $64,300 for a family of four versus $96,450.
The Florida Phoenix reported Tuesday that Florida Medicaid Director Brian Meyer did not know the number of children who had been disenrolled from the program for nonpayment of premiums.
“I don’t have that information handy, but I’d be certainly happy to work with our Florida Healthy Kids Corp. partners on that information,” Myers told members of the Senate Health Policy Committee during his presentation on the program.
Following publication of our story, Florida Healthy Kids spokesperson Ashley Carr told the Phoenix that 17,5101 children had been removed from the subsidized program during the period in question for failing to pay premiums. Another 8,614 children who weren’t receiving subsidies but were enrolled in the program lost coverage for nonpayment of premiums. Those children live in families that earn too much to qualify for subsidies but are willing to pay full costs of the health insurance plan.
The report obtained by the Florida Phoenix shows 8,511 full-pay children were disenrolled during the 12 month span and never signed back up for the program. Another 4,281 children were disenrolled for nonpayment but later signed back up and paid the full premium.

The continuous eligibility requirement doesn’t apply to children in those families because they earn too much to qualify. But they most likely would have qualified  for subsidized coverage had the DeSantis administration implemented HB 121. 
 Meyer can’t “verify” data

During a Wednesday morning meeting of the House Health Care Facilities & Systems Subcommittee meeting, Westin Democrat Robin Bartleman pressed Meyer about the number of children who have been disenrolled. And for the second time in as many days, Meyer said he didn’t know.
“I want to verify the number of families that are off KidCare currently. I know you were asked this question and you didn’t have the data,” Bartleman said, asking him to verify removal of 17,510 children with subsidized coverage and another 8,614 full-pay children. “Can you verify those numbers?”
Meyer replied: “I’m not able to verify those numbers at this time; I don’t have those in front of me.” He added that he would be happy to follow up.

Josh Schriver of Oxford, including accounts on adult entertainment, hookup sex and webcam sites.
The connection was first reported in a story published by The Detroit Metro Times.
When Michigan Advance reached out to Schriver’s office for comment, he vehemently denied the allegation and accusations that the accounts or email address implicated in the information ever belonged to him.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I have never used or accessed any of the sites mentioned, and I had no clue they even existed until reached out about it,” he said in a statement sent by his staff via email. “The Metro Times article relies on unverified data from old internet breaches and attempts to connect me to something I have absolutely nothing to do with. Anyone familiar with how these databases work knows they are often inaccurate, manipulated, or misattributed, and it is irresponsible for a publication to present them as fact.”
Schriver similarly told Detroit Metro Times that he believed the information to have been forged.
The representative is among the most far-right legislators in the Michigan Legislature. He introduced a resolution to make same sex marriage be illegal again, was stripped of his staff and committee assignments by House Democratic leadership after sharing views related to the racist Great Replacement Theory, wrote legislation to ban all pornography in the state and voted against bills banning child marriage and closing the marital rape loophole.

The Detroit Metro Times reported Tuesday that it had reviewed information on two different websites that track data breaches, and found that emails appearing to be connected to Schriver were associated with an account on Fling.com, a website that advertises adult hookups, swinger meet ups and collection of webcams.
Fling.com was the victim of a data breach in 2016, which the company has acknowledged since.
According to the Metro Times article, the website also has authenticated information leaked during the breach, much of which was sold on the seedier parts of the internet, known as the dark web. Detroit Metro Times claimed that the email address matched Schriver’s first, middle and last name and the account was tagged with an IP address in East Lansing. The publication claims the dates of use on the account coincide with Schriver’s time as a student at Michigan State University.
Still, Schriver was adamant that the story was nothing more than “a needless attack on my character and a distraction from the real work our office is doing for the people of Michigan.”
“My focus remains on protecting families, restoring accountability in Lansing, and defending our values. I will not be intimidated or silenced by falsehoods and cheap political attacks,” Schriver told the Advance. “We are currently reviewing all available options for a formal retraction and will continue to stand firm against misinformation that seeks to undermine honest public service.”
The story on Schriver follows the 2024 arrest, with no charges filed, of former state Rep. Neil Friske, a Republican, who was taken into police custody after police were called to the scene of his former Lansing dwelling on a report of shots fired. His arrest was based on allegations of sexual assault and and a weapons offense. No legal consequences ever came of it and the story died out quickly.
The investigation into the Friske matter was initially handled by the Ingham County Prosecutor’s Office, but was later referred to Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office. As of July, the office was still investigating the matter and had not filed charges against Friske.
While there was no legal consequence for Friske, he did lose his primary election that year to the current state Rep. Parker Fairbairn (R-Harbor Springs).

That could change with a faster turn-around under a new state law.","In summary
California is known for taking weeks to tally its ballots, causing uncertainty and frustration among voters. That could change with a faster turn-around under a new state law.


California’s famously slow vote-counting process could see slight improvements next year after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that gives counties an earlier deadline to tally voters’ ballots.
The law, Assembly Bill 5, requires county election offices to count ballots no later than 13 days after election day, but does not change the 30-day deadline for local officials to certify results. Counties unable to meet the new deadline must give a reason for an extension to the secretary of state’s office.
“California has one of the most accessible and secure voting systems in the country,” said the bill’s author, Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Menlo Park Democrat, in a statement. “One opportunity for improvement was to speed up how quickly we count ballots and create a system that gave greater certainty to the public for when results would be available.”
Voter fraud is rare, typically occurs in isolated instances and is generally detected. However, local election officials have received greater scrutiny across the country after President Donald Trump and his allies disputed false claims of election fraud after the 2020 election. 
Local officials in California have since launched social media campaigns to explain and show voters how their ballots are processed. 
Lawmakers suggest the new law, which received bipartisan support in the state Legislature, will help clamp down on misinformation as some Republicans have grown increasingly distrustful of mail ballots.
Proponents such as the nonprofit California Voter Foundation have said it will increase the public’s trust in elections and avoid officials being sworn in before their races have been certified, which was the case for a number of state lawmakers last year.
Secretary of State Shirley Weber’s office opposed the bill. 
Timothy Cromartie, a spokesperson for Weber, said at a Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee earlier this year that there was a concern that 13 days would not be enough time for counties, which currently have 30 days to complete the count. The secretary of state’s office proposed a deadline of 15 days instead, but that was not adopted.
“As always, we will do our best to uphold the laws as passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor,” Weber said in a written statement.
More mail-in ballots slow down counting
It is increasingly common for counties to take weeks to count ballots due to the growing popularity of mail-in ballots, particularly after the coronavirus pandemic. More than 80% of California voters voted by mail in the 2024 November election, according to the secretary of state’s office. That trend has accelerated since a 2021 law required each registered voter to receive a mail ballot. 
Mail ballots take longer for officials to process than votes at a polling place because of the required steps for officials to verify signatures and confirm that voters have not already cast a ballot somewhere else. The state also allows ballots postmarked by election day to be counted even if they arrive up to a week later. Those ballots will not be subject to the 13-day deadline, nor will provisional ballots or ballots missing voter signatures.
It is not possible to know how long it took counties to count all their ballots in the last election because of a state law that prohibited them from certifying results any earlier than 28 days after election day, Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, said in an email.
“Historically, some counties count faster than others. This has to do with a number of factors – space, equipment, staffing,” Alexander said. 
Some California counties, such as Los Angeles, can take close to a month to count election results, as was the case last year in the 22nd Congressional District in Southern California, which was eventually won by Democratic Rep. Derek Tran. Experts largely attribute California’s size and widespread use of mail-in ballots as the reason for this.
Los Angeles County officials say the new law will change little about how they process ballots.
“We’ve always processed ballots much earlier than the date signed into the law. We’re not particularly concerned with that 13-day requirement,” said Mike Sanchez, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Clerk. “It may seem more ceremonial than anything else.”
Election workers have said that public messaging urging voters to drop or mail off their ballots sooner could speed up the process.
Newsom also signed a bill that bans voters from being paid to register to vote in response to the millions of dollars that billionaire Elon Musk gave away to registered voters in swing states during the 2024 election. Another piece of legislation he signed would schedule a ballot measure for the 2026 election to allow voters to decide if taxpayer funds can be used for political campaigns.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524_Sacramento-General-Election_MG_CM_46.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 13:57:59.369606

Property Tax Reassessment Committee Hears From County Administrators and National Experts as Review Continues
By Brent Burdge, Contributing Journalist
DOVER, Del., Oct. 7, 2025 (AP) — Delaware lawmakers gathered Wednesday for the second hearing of the Special Property Reassessment Committee, moving the state’s review of its controversial property reassessment forward with new testimony from county officials and national experts.
During the session, Sussex County Administrator Todd Lawson and Kent County Administrator Kevin Sipple delivered detailed presentations outlining their counties’ experiences and challenges with the reassessment process. They highlighted the importance of accuracy, transparency, and public engagement to ensure a fair outcome for all Delaware property owners.
The committee also heard from two subject matter experts: Justin Eimers, Assessment Advisor for the International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO), and Ron Rakow, a Fellow at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. Both provided insight on best practices from other states and answered lawmakers’ questions about reassessment methodology, fair taxation, and public communication.
The experts emphasized the value of standardized assessment processes, clear public messaging, and ongoing review to build trust in the system. Lawmakers questioned Eimers and Rakow about the potential for varying tax rates based on property types and the ability of counties to adapt to new categories or approaches.
Both experts advised a move toward “annual reassessment”, although not a full revaluation, as was just completed.  Other states have mechanisms in place to adjust values more frequently (annually) to keep values more in line with “market value”.  These adjustments are done based on recent sales, permits and other data that influences neighborhoods, subdivisions, zip codes, etc…
Legislator questions included focus on possible and preferred methods for providing relief for various classes of property owners.

Assessment/Valuation caps – both experts advised against this approach, as it tends to perpetuate the problems that were experienced by a lack of revaluation and reassessment. High value property owners are most protected and the disparity in taxation of properties is maintained.
Circuit Breakers – This was a preferred approach, where taxation is limited based upon a % of income (e.g. 5% of income, max). It would require annual application, but some states incorporate the application with the state income tax filing.
Homestead Exemptions – Also a “progressive” solution, where homeowners receive a flat dollar amount of reduction (like the current $500 for Delaware seniors) or a percentage reduction in the property value. An issue with this solution is that it may miss low-income renters versus homeowners.
Property Tax Deferral – This provides the option of deferring the tax due (with interest) until the property is next sold. This is essentially creating a “home equity loan” until the accrued tax can be paid upon sale of the property.  This avoids the displacement of long-time owners due to the expense of the tax burden.  However, in the experience of other states, this is not widely used and doesn’t appear to provide a comprehensive solution.

As in previous meetings, the committee addressed updates on the implementation of recent legislation and reaffirmed its commitment to transparency and public involvement. All committee hearings remain open to the public and are available for viewing via livestream on the General Assembly’s website.
The committee is expected to continue examining reassessment structures in future sessions, aiming to give clarity and guidance for Delaware’s property tax system moving forward. Residents are encouraged to participate as the process advances throughout the fall.
Upcoming meetings are scheduled:

Hearing #3: Week of October 20, 2025 (Expect Oct. 21, but exact date TBD) – Delawareans and Their Property Taxes: Impacts on residents, comparisons to other states’ programs, and updates to exemptions post-reassessment.
Hearing #4: Week of November 3, 2025 (Expect Nov. 4, but exact date TBD) – Property Reassessment and Education Funding: How reassessments affect school revenues, the 10% windfall rule, and balancing equity in funding without overburdening taxpayers.

The committee hearings will be open to public attendance at Legislative Hall and streamed on the General Assembly website, www.legis.delaware.gov. Post-hearing, the committees will compile findings and propose legislation for the January 2026 session.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Former state Superintendent Ryan Walters is under an ethics investigation again, this time over an alleged conflict of interest.
The Oklahoma Ethics Commission revealed Tuesday it is gathering materials and information regarding Walters’ departure from office. Walters, who did not immediately return a request for comment, resigned Sept. 30 to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, a conservative nonprofit that he promoted through his elected position.
The Ethics Commission has not disclosed specifics of what it is investigating — only that the inquiry centers on conflict of interest rules — and is not required to make public the complaints it has received.
However, Rep. Ellen Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City, filed an ethics complaint against Walters on March 25 over his use of state resources to endorse the Teacher Freedom Alliance, alleging he violated rules governing state officers and private economic interests. She renewed her complaint after Walters announced he would resign to join the organization.
Walters issued a news release March 10 on the Oklahoma State Department of Education letterhead, touting the Teacher Freedom Alliance as an “alternative to woke teachers’ unions.”

Pogemiller alleged this violated rules that prohibit public officeholders from using state resources to endorse or give preferential treatment to a private entity.
“Superintendent Walters’ endorsement is intended to result in increased membership and financial benefits for (the Teacher Freedom Alliance) at the expense of competing labor organizations, which is a blatant misuse of official position,” her complaint states.
Pogemiller worked for the state’s largest teacher union, the Oklahoma Education Association, until she took office as a House lawmaker.
She said she is grateful the Ethics Commission is investigating Walters.
“Oklahomans deserve accountability when taxpayer dollars are used for personal gain,” Pogemiller said.
Walters already has paid $23,300 to settle other ethics complaints over contributions to his 2022 campaign for state superintendent and regarding his social media activity while in office.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Asked whether he’s mulling a presidential campaign in 2028, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told the Bulletin during a visit to New Hampshire Tuesday that “I’ll sit down with my family and we’ll see.”
During an event held by Manchester City Democrats at a local brewery, Beshear said he’ll start thinking about a presidential campaign after he finishes his term leading the Democratic Governors Association. Beshear is currently vice chairman of the organization and chair-elect. He’s set to lead the group through 2026.
“We’re going to win in some places that nobody’s expecting,” he said.
Throughout the evening, Beshear repeated one phrase: “We’ve gotta spend 80% of our time focusing on issues that matter to 100% of Americans.”
“The Democratic Party needs to be a common-sense, common-ground, get things done type of party,” he said. “We need to put the American people first, and our policies need to get results.”
He said that includes creating jobs, making health care accessible, building safe infrastructure, investing in public education, and ensuring public safety.
Beshear insisted his visit to New Hampshire, an electorally important state in the presidential election, was about helping Democrats in the Granite State.
He also responded to Democratic voters’ demands that elected leaders be more forceful in their responses to the Trump administration.
“I think what you see from me is someone that’s not afraid to criticize this president, and I do it in a state that voted for him by 30 points,” Beshear said. “But at the same time, if we’re going to have credibility, when the president does something that’s positive for our states, we need to make sure we’re admitting that too.”
He cited the president’s response to flooding in Kentucky in February as an example of something positive, but criticized his tariff campaigns and cuts to health care in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
“You can be forceful in standing up to this president, while also creating a vision for a better country,” Beshear said. “The Democratic Party has to be more than just against someone, we’ve got to be for something.”
While Beshear saw a warm welcome among Manchester Democrats, a pro-Palestine group protested his visit to the state with a TV ad campaign. The Institute for Middle East Understanding put out ads showing the devastation in Gaza wrought by Israeli air strikes and military campaigns. The ad criticized him for previously declining to answer questions about whether he’d stop sending weapons to Israel saying, “If you won’t stand against genocide, you can’t be our next president.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/beshearmanch-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-10-08 13:57:59.369606

“It feels good to celebrate my culture,” said Nancy Morosky, a Gulf Coast resident originally from Puerto Rico. “I like to be reminded of where we come from, and I want to pass it down to the next generation.”Pascagoula has one of the largest Hispanic communities on the Gulf Coast. According to the 2020 Census, nearly 15% of its 22,000 residents identify as Hispanic or Latino. In Jackson County, the share is closer to 7 percent.

PASCAGOULA — Tiras de papel picado y banderas de países de América Latina —con sus colores fuertes y diseños llamativos— brillaban bajo el sol de septiembre y sobre las cabezas de los asistentes al Festival Hispano de Pascagoula. El 20 de septiembre, familias de toda la Costa del Golfo se reunieron para celebrar su orgullo gastronómico, musical y cultural al aire libre.
En el festival, puestos de comida ofrecían tamales, tortillas frescas, empanadas y otros platos. Zona Libre tocaba música latina y la multitud bailaba, inmersa en los sonidos. Sus rostros transmitían orgullo y emoción. Los miembros de Studio of Dance y Gymnastics, luciendo trajes típicos coloridos, daban vueltas mientras que los asistentes mayores conversaban sobre cultura y raíces en sus países de nacimiento.

“Se siente bien celebrar mi cultura”, dijo Nancy Morosky, una residente de la Costa del Golfo que nació en Puerto Rico. “Me gusta recordar de dónde venimos y quiero transmitirlo a la siguiente generación”.
Pascagoula es hogar de una de las comunidades latinas más grandes de la Costa del Golfo. Según el censo de 2020, cerca de 15% de sus 22,000 residentes se identifica como hispano o latino. En el condado de Jackson, la proporción es de casi 7%.

Main Street Pascagoula y la ciudad organizaron el evento, que ya está en su cuarto año. 
“Creemos que es importante porque tenemos una amplia comunidad hispana a lo largo de toda la Costa del Mississippi, y nos encanta reunir a la gente para celebrar eso con comida, compañerismo y entretenimiento sano”, dijo Susannah Northrop, directora ejecutiva de Main Street Pascagoula.

El evento destacó más que comida, música y trajes típicos. Demostró cómo las familias latinas en la Costa del Golfo han construido una comunidad que crece y que se conecta. 
A medida que el día llegaba a su fin, tambores y maracas mantenían el ritmo. Los asistentes bailaban, reían y celebraban su rica cultura y herencia bajo el cielo oscuro de la noche del sur de Mississippi.

Mario Lanzarotti, TEDxWilmington speaker in 2022, said,  “Stop Doubting Yourself and Go After What You Really, Really Want,”  and it went viral. 
By Jamie Kleman, Contributing Journalist
WILMINGTON – Sometimes the simplest ideas have the biggest impact. For millions of people around the world, that moment of clarity came from a stage in Delaware. At TEDxWilmington in 2022, Mario Lanzarotti stepped up to talk about something universal – self-doubt. His message, “Stop Doubting Yourself and Go After What You Really, Really Want,” didn’t promise instant confidence or a perfect life. Instead, it offered a small but powerful shift in perspective: don’t bury your doubts, share them.
“Self-doubt is not something you need to eliminate,” Lanzarotti told the Wilmington audience. “It’s a voice inside you that deserves to be heard. When you bring it into the open, when you share it, it loses its power to control you.”
That idea, born on a Delaware stage, has now reached more than 2.7 million people online. Viewers from around the globe continue to return to Lanzarotti’s talk because it blends honesty with action – encouraging people to forgive themselves, talk about their doubts, and see them as guideposts instead of obstacles.
A Global Coach Rooted in Authenticity
Lanzarotti, who is half Italian and half German, now lives in Cape Town, South Africa, where he works as a leadership and performance coach and serves as the founder of Aligned Founders – a growing community and training hub helping male entrepreneurs scale without burnout, chaos, or self-doubt.
After exiting his first New York startup, he discovered what many high-performing men face but rarely admit: success stops feeling like success when it constantly depends on you.
“I had the money and freedom I wanted,” he said, “but underneath it all, I was anxious, exhausted, and quietly asking, why doesn’t this feel better?”
That question led him to uncover what he calls the real bottleneck – not strategy, but the way many men lead themselves and others. Through his coaching and community programs, Lanzarotti helps founders shift from operator mode to leader mode, breaking the mental, emotional, and behavioral patterns that lead to overthinking, inconsistency, and burnout.
So far, more than 2,000 founders across 15+ countries have used his frameworks to scale faster—with less force, more focus, and true freedom.
Expanding a Movement of Mindful Leadership
Now, Lanzarotti is expanding Aligned Founders throughout South Africa, creating monthly founder dinners and full-day growth experiences that bring entrepreneurs together to connect, reflect, and grow without sacrificing their well-being.
His favorite quote – “The most important journey in life is the one you take from your head into your heart” – captures both his coaching philosophy and the essence of his TEDx message.
A Delaware Idea with Global Impact
TEDxWilmington has long prided itself on being more than a speaking series. It’s a launchpad where ideas introduced in an intimate theater can ripple out to the world. Lanzarotti’s viral success underscores just how far those ripples can go.
After his talk went live, Mario was flooded with messages from around the world – new clients, podcasts and speaking invitations, and hundreds of personal notes from people who said his words changed the way they viewed themselves.
“After my TEDx went viral,” he shared, “people from all walks of life reached out to thank me. It’s been incredible to see how one honest message could touch so many hearts.”
Making Life a Little Better
The success of Lanzarotti’s message highlights the power of one idea to make life just a little better – whether that means a student finding the courage to pursue a dream, an entrepreneur pushing through fear, or a parent giving themselves grace.
Delaware may not be the first place people think of when it comes to global ideas, but TEDxWilmington continues to prove that the First State can inspire millions.
And as Mario Lanzarotti’s 2.7-million-view milestone shows, sometimes all it takes is a stage, a speaker, and one simple idea – to change the way the world sees itself.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-124014.jpg,,,2025-10-08 13:01:18.316909

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier received a big boost in his bid for a full four-year term next year when President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he was endorsing him in 2026.
“James Uthmeier is a Strong Conservative Fighter and Prosecutor, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement — HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!” Trump posted on his Truth Social page.
“James is an America First Warrior, who is a true champion for ‘MAGA,’” the president added. “He is THE MAN behind ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ, and argued strongly at the United States Supreme Court in defense of my Executive Power to fire Deep State bureaucrats. Under James’ fearless leadership, over 1,000 CRIMINAL PEDOPHILES have been arrested, missing children have been SAVED, and our Great Members of Law Enforcement have been empowered to do their jobs and, KEEP FLORIDA SAFE. In his next term, James will continue to work tirelessly to Ensure Law and Order, Uphold our Constitutional Rights, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment.”
The endorsement came a month after reports surfaced that the president was considering backing Florida Speaker of the House Daniel Perez for AG.
Uthemier, 37, is a close ally of Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The governor appointed him in February to serve as attorney general, after the office fell vacant when DeSantis appointed Ashley Moody to replace Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate. Next year’s election will be the first time he has ever run for political office.
Earlier, Uthmeier served for more than three years as chief of staff to DeSantis. He also served for several months as campaign manager in the governor’s unsuccessful candidacy for president in 2023-2024, replacing Generra Peck in August 2023.
While the Trump endorsement is big, it doesn’t mean it’s all clear sailing for Uthmeier. That’s because of his involvement in the controversy surrounding Hope Florida, the state program First Lady Casey DeSantis created to move Floridians off government services and into private charity.
That story revolves around a $10 million from a Medicaid over-billing settlement the DeSantis administration steered to the Hope Florida Foundation in 2024. That money was ultimately diverted to a political committee created to fight a proposed constitutional amendment legalizing marijuana that Uthmeier headed.
Florida Rep. Alex Andrade, R-Pensacola, chaired a committee in the Florida House during the 2025 legislative session that investigated the story. He has accused the attorney general of money laundering and wire fraud, and has called on him to resign.
Uthmeier has denied any wrongdoing.
The story resurfaced last week after the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald reported that the state’s attorney in Tallahassee has convened a grand jury relating to the Hope Florida Foundation.
‘America-first’
During his swearing-in ceremony in February, Uthmeier promised to champion an “America-first” agenda. “We will not stand idly by as the left tries to infiltrate our institutions and use the court system to indoctrinate our kids,” Uthmeier said. “We will fight the activists that try to weaken our duly enacted laws, that try to challenge the constitutional order, and that try to harm the unborn.”
Uthmeier has raised nearly $600,000 in his regular campaign account, and more than $2 million through his political committee, Friends of James Uthmeier.
Among the Democrats running for the nomination for attorney general next year, the best-known candidate is former South Florida state Sen. José Javier Rodríguez.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The University of Northern Iowa’s civic education center will receive more than $1 million in federal funding to lead statewide efforts in strengthening civic education.
The Cedar Falls university announced in a news release it has received a three-year, $1.22 million American History and Civics Education – Seminars grant from the U.S. Department of Education to form the Iowa Civic Educators Institute. The institute is an initiative to prepare educators and material to teach on American politics, history, government and founding principles.
“The Iowa Civic Educators Institute is an opportunity to provide content-rich professional development to Iowa’s current and future teachers that will strengthen civic learning for students across Iowa,” said Allison Rank, director of UNI’s Center for Civic Education, in the release. “Money and time are two significant barriers for teachers interested in this kind of extensive professional development. Through this grant, we’ll be able to provide ICEI participants a stipend, as well as cover programming costs.”

According to the release, the Iowa Civic Educators Institute will focus on providing future and current teachers with additional education on “American political tradition and the ideas, traditions, institutions and texts essential to American Constitutional government and our American history and heritage.” The institute will also work to develop course materials on these topics, as well as Iowa history and politics.
Seminars for educators will also be available, split between pre-service and in-service teachers and those focused on elementary education, the release stated. These events will touch on civic values and experience, the relationship between individual rights and community membership and “Iowa as a constitutional subject.”
UNI received approval from the Iowa Board of Regents for the center for civic education in September 2024, after the board directed each state university to explore such initiatives. University President Mark Nook said in the release the grant “affirms the national importance” of training and educating people to be “informed and engaged citizens.”
“The Iowa Civic Educators Institute will empower teachers across our state with the knowledge and tools to strengthen civic learning for generations of students,” Nook said in the release. “We are deeply grateful to Governor Reynolds for her support of our grant application, and to the U.S. Department of Education for investing in this vision. Together, we are ensuring that civic education remains a cornerstone of Iowa’s schools and communities.”

This image is of a statue on the HINU campus in Lawrence, Kansas, depicting an Apache hoop and pole game player. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — University of Kansas indigenous studies director Alex Red Corn said a $1.5 million grant would allow a five-year collaboration with tribal nations and school districts in three states to broaden the pipeline of K-12 teachers working in schools serving Native American students.
The difficulty of attracting and retaining teachers to serve Native American students has been fueled from insufficient funding, isolation of rural communities and lack of job-market recruiting.
 KU was awarded the grant from the Office of Indian Education in the U.S. Department of Education. The program involves the Southern Plains American Indian Teaching Pathways Project, which is a partnership that included Haskell Indian Nations University, or HINU, in Lawrence.
The goal is to work with Native Nations and school districts in Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma to prepare and mentor 15 teachers in elementary or secondary education.
“We look forward to getting started recruiting folks from Native communities and offer them a funded pathway to full teacher licensure through KU and Haskell and continuing to grow our longstanding partnership with Haskell in new and exciting ways,” said Red Corn, an Osage member, the lead principal investigator on the project and a KU associate professor.
Under the program, researchers plan to recruit individuals who earned or were approaching completion of an associate’s degree and want to pursue teaching certification by earning a bachelor’s degree at HINU or KU.
Upon graduation, these certified teachers would be required to work in Native-serving schools, where they would receive career mentorship from experienced teachers and cultural leaders.
KU officials said students involved in the program would be eligible for financial support in the form of tuition and fees, monthly living stipends, books, laptops and academic conference travel.
“We’re very appreciative of this opportunity from the Office of Indian Education, which is such a critical resource for tribal nations looking to advance sovereignty in education,” Red Corn said.
He said tribe and school partners in the region were eager to participate in work on a sustained program to bolster the teacher-development pipeline.
Project partners on the grant application included HINU, Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, Osage Nation, Quapaw Nation, and the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes.
Other partners in the teacher development effort would be Royal Valley Schools and South Brown County Schools as well as Daposka Ahnkodapi (Osage Nation School), Darlington Public Schools, Umoⁿhoⁿ Nation Public School and the Tribal Education Departments National Assembly.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Haskellstatue-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 13:01:18.316909

The suit, filed with the Michigan Court of Claims Tuesday, argues that the new law, and the steps leading up to its enactment, violates several sections of the Michigan Constitution, including requirements for amending the law that legalized marijuana in the state. 
Voters in 2018 approved Proposal 1, creating the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, which legalized marijuana for recreational use by individuals 21 and older. The law also levies a 10% excise tax on the commercial sale of marijuana. 
In its complaint, the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association argues this law is the exclusive means for imposing an excise tax on the sale of marijuana, and that in order to modify the voter-initiated statute, the matter would either need to be approved by voters or achieve a three-fourths vote in the Legislature. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The 24% tax was approved by the Michigan House in a 78-21 vote, with 11 members not voting, while the matter passed the Senate in a tight 19-17 vote with one member not voting and one seat vacant. 
Because the 24% was enacted through a separate law, and did not achieve three-fourths support from the 138 member Legislature, the association argues the attempt to levy a new tax is invalid. 
2025-10-07 -Summons and Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
 
The association also argued the original title of the bill was misleading and that the policy underwent an unlawful change of purpose leading up to the final version approved by the Legislature, shifting from a policy creating a fund for road funding and revenue replacement without establishing any tax, to one imposing a 24% excise tax on marijuana wholesale prices. 
The new law also violates the state constitution’s contracts clause, the group alleges. 
The Michigan Cannabis Industry Association has requested a declaratory judgment deeming the new tax law invalid and unenforceable, alongside injunctive relief preventing the state government from enforcing the act. 
In an email Wednesday morning, Department of Treasury spokesperson Ron Leix said the department had not been served the lawsuit and does not have any comment.

The town of Fairfield is now reflecting on how the storm and the damage it caused shaped the town’s storm preparedness strategies.
In 2012, Sandy damaged more than 1,000 homes in Fairfield and required the evacuation of more than 5,000 residents, according to Connecticut Department of Housing’s Mia Delaire.
“This was not simply a weather event, it was a wake up call to strengthen our infrastructure and planning for the future,” Delaire said. “Moving beyond recovery and moving towards resilience by coupling immediate need with forward looking solutions, Fairfield has strengthened its capacity to withstand future storm events and protect its critical services.”
Statewide, the storm damaged about 3,000 homes and knocked out power to more than 600,000 families. It cost Connecticut more than $350 million in damage and exposed the state’s infrastructure weaknesses.
Following the storm, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) gave Connecticut more than $150 million to work on repairs, about $7 million of which went to Fairfield.
The funds provided flood control structures, a storm water pump station and backup grid services in case the power goes out for an extended period.
Two projects in Fairfield helped the town recover from Sandy. One project updated flood controls, while the second established a microgrid, or “a core generation and backup” for town facilities. This grid helps ensure power and services stay in place should there be an extended power outage, Delaire said.
The backup grid was finished recently, according to Fairfield Public Works General Manager John Cottell.
“The microgrid project actually started with a contract back in 2015 as they were applying for the HUD grants,” Cottell said. “We had a few delays with it, but we finally completed this past year.”
Fairfield’s improvements on the wastewater system were used to highlight Connecticut’s response and adaptation to climate change during the state’s second annual sustainability and resiliency week.
Aspects of Fairfield’s work to repair and strengthen its storm protections took years due to the complexity of the project and delays.
Repairing and adding to the town’s storm management system was complicated, according to Bill Hurley, Engineering Manager for the town of Fairfield.
“They had to be constructed without disrupting operations of the treatment plant, but the critical infrastructure also included the animal shelter and a composting facility as well,” Hurley said. “One of the things that I would suggest to people is to realize that there’s always going to be unexpected situations that occur.”
Despite the projects’ complexities, both parts of the infrastructure upgrades are complete.
“Fairfield has strengthened its capacity to withstand future storm events and protect its critical services,” Delaire said.

The Target along Middletown Warwick Road in Middletown, Delaware, held a celebratory event in honor of the store opening a year ago.
 
MIDDLETOWN — Customers looking to grab Taylor Swift’s new album or just regular household items were welcomed into the Northside Shopping Center Target with balloons and posters on Friday, October 3, as the store celebrated its first year in the Middletown community.
Customers walking into Target early in the day entered the store underneath a red and white balloon arch right into a large celebratory backdrop filled with balloons and a number one statue. Alongside the photo backdrop was a table with a couple of gift baskets, raffle tickets and a pumpkin for patrons to sign all as a way to celebrate Target’s inclusion in the Middletown community a year ago.

“We wanted to build a community as soon as we opened here … and now we’re looking at it live a year later, how beautiful this store has come to life, and how we impacted the community here,” said store director Lauren DiRenzo.

Since its opening in October 2024, DiRenzo said the store has generated over 100 jobs for the surrounding community. In addition, Target staff have made a presence in community events like the Blackbird State Forest cleanup and volunteering at local food banks, according to a Target spokesperson.  
“My team is super excited about giving back and they want to volunteer,” said DiRenzo. “I think it’s just the care that goes into all that and why we’re here and why we’re serving our guests here at Target. It’s one team, one community.”
Since its inclusion in the Middletown community, Target employees donated over 3,000 hours of their time for local causes. The store itself donated over $500,000 of product and money to causes throughout the state, said a Target spokesperson. 
Patrons of Target told Delaware Live that there was some hesitation and skepticism about Target coming to the shopping center, because of a perceived increase in traffic. After a year in the community, those concerns haven’t been much of an issue.
“Overall I was really skeptical at first, but I think it’s been a really good addition to not just the community, but our neighborhood as well,” said community member Mariah Czyszczon.
Czyszczon said she shops at the Target about twice a week because of its proximity and convenience.  
DiRenzo said the store and staff try to generate togetherness with the community it serves by staying true to the Target motto of  “care, grow and win”. One of the ways the store is accomplishing that feat is by a newer layout that includes a larger food and beverage section that DiRenzo said is driving “a lot of business” for the store. It’s one of two locations throughout the United States with this upgraded design, said the spokesperson.
Another is Target’s relationship with national and local vendors like Poppi and Page Street Beauty, both of whom set up booths throughout the store for customers to visit. The Poppi booth handed out free samples of a few of its flavors.

Later in the day, customers visiting the store got to enjoy live music and food trucks culminating a day for Target to celebrate the community it serves and a community that supports them. 
“What we are super excited about is when we have guests come in here, building relationships with our guests, seeing what they’re coming in here for,” said DiRenzo. “They are coming in to serve us. We are doing it vice versa.”

Ned Lamont said in a statement that he's opposed to the mobilization but isn't ready give up on the governors' organization over it.,"The Democratic governors of California and Illinois are threatening to leave the National Governors Association because of its silence on President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops across state lines despite objections from the receiving states’ leaders.
“If we cannot come together, on a bipartisan basis, on this basic principle of state sovereignty, what purpose does the National Governors Association serve?” California Gov. Gavin Newsom asked in a letter to the nation’s other governors.
The bipartisan governors’ group, founded in 1908, advocates for issues on which governors find common ground and hosts meetings where they can exchange ideas. Separate Democratic and Republican governors’ associations take more partisan positions and help finance campaigns.
Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, both potential 2028 presidential candidates, contend Trump’s troop deployments should be a matter of concern for all governors. But some Republican governors have supported Trump’s actions, and the national governors’ group has not taken a position.
“I’m not sure the policy issue of whether the Constitution allows for federal involvement in the state and the National Guard is something that the NGA would want to tackle,” said Republican Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, who co-chairs the organization’s task force on emergency management and public health.
The Democratic governors of Kansas, Michigan and Minnesota already have left the NGA this year. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said she didn’t think the roughly $100,000 annual dues paid by the state were a good investment and encouraged the group to push back against canceled federal grants.
Some Democrats see Guard action diminishing states’ role
The bipartisan governors’ organization is far from the first institution to face division and doubts over how it should respond to sweeping changes in Trump’s second term. Since returning to office, Trump has been using executive power in ways that presidents usually don’t.
This week, he has attempted to deploy Texas National Guard members to Chicago and California Guard members to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal immigration facilities and personnel amid what Trump describes as out-of-control crime. Democratic officials in those states have sued over the efforts, as has California. So far, judges have blocked the deployment in Oregon but haven’t stopped it in Illinois.
Newsom and Pritzker have argued the National Guard deployments are not just a policy difference but an infringement on state sovereignty that must be condemned.
“The credibility of the National Governors Association — and our integrity as state executives — rests on our willingness to apply our principles consistently, regardless of which administration attacks them,” Pritzker said in a letter Monday to Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, the chair of the National Governors Association.
Stitt did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment from The Associated Press. But he said in a news conference last month that the group should steer clear of areas where there’s not a consensus and leave those to the Democratic Governors Association and Republican Governors Association.
Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who authorized the call-up of 400 Texas National Guard members, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. On Monday, he posted a cartoon on his X account showing the Democratic governors of California, Illinois and New York telling Trump, “LEAVE OUR CRIME ALONE.”
Bipartisan group doesn’t always weigh in
The National Governors Association bills itself as a beacon of bipartisanship, which means it stays out of a lot of the thorniest battles. Some topics where governors have found common ground include disaster preparedness, workforce development and expanding broadband access.
Last week, Stitt and NGA vice chair Wes Moore, the Democratic governor of Maryland and a possible 2028 presidential candidate, condemned the then-looming federal government shutdown, calling for dialogue but not a specific policy solution: “We urge federal leaders from both sides to work to set aside political games and pass a budget that reflects the values and promises states commit to every day.”
But no unity has emerged on Trump’s immigration and crime-fighting policies.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said in a statement that he’s opposed to the mobilization but isn’t ready give up on the governors’ organization over it. “My hope is that the NGA will continue to advocate for the best interest of the states,” he said.
Kehoe said no one has asked him to sign onto a statement denouncing Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to states against a governor’s will. Earlier this year, Kehoe successfully pushed for a state makeover of the St. Louis Police Department oversight board despite the objections of the Democratic mayor, citing crime as justification.
“Certainly Chicago could use some help,” Kehoe said. “I would hope that Governor Pritzker would welcome help to keep his citizens safe.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25280594497993-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 13:01:18.316909

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s Legislature acted unconstitutionally when it passed a new law creating business courts, the state’s highest court ruled.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled 6-2 on Tuesday that the Legislature “exceeded the boundaries” of the state Constitution in part because lawmakers lack the authority to create a court system beyond the eight that already exist. The justices found that legislators attempted to create a special type of judge who is paid differently, has different terms and is exempt from voter scrutiny, an oversight power guaranteed to Oklahomans by the state Constitution.
Senate Bill 632 had sought to create business courts in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, but attorneys Joe E. White Jr. and Jason Waddell sued, questioning the constitutionality. They asked that the law be tossed out because business court judges would have been accountable only to the Legislature and the governor rather than to voters, which they contended was unconstitutional.
Supporters, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, had argued that the courts would help attract businesses to Oklahoma.
Stitt said in a statement that while the outcome was disappointing, it will not deter from his mission to make Oklahoma top 10.
“The Supreme Court’s decision to block the business courts law passed by a bipartisan super majority mandate of the Legislature stands in stark contrast to our reputation as the most business-friendly state,” he said. “There is still a need and overwhelming bipartisan support for specialized business courts, and as was acknowledged in the decision, a path forward to establishing such courts in Oklahoma.” 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, who authored the legislation, did not immediately comment on Wednesday.
The Supreme Court ruled that adding a new court system would require a constitutional amendment. Judicial power is currently vested only in eight state courts — the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court on the Judiciary, the State Industrial Court, the Court of Bank Review, the Court of Tax Review and district courts.
At one time the state Constitution allowed lawmakers the authority to create courts, but that power was abolished in 1967 as part of broader judicial reform effort, and the Legislature’s power was intentionally limited, according to the ruling, which was penned by Justice Noma Gurich.
The Constitution does not give lawmakers any authority to create new courts outside of “immediate appellate” and municipal courts, the justices found.
Gurich wrote that the “business court division” is part of the district court system, which means under the state Constitution those business court judges are essentially district court judges, who must be elected by voters in nonpartisan elections. SB 632 does not require the election of business court judges. 
Under SB 632, business court judges would have been selected by the governor from a list of three candidates compiled by the House speaker. They would then be confirmed by the state Senate. A business court judge would be guaranteed an eight-year term with the possibility of being reappointed.
The law would circumvent the Judicial Nominating Commission, which currently recommends candidates to fill judicial vacancies. The commission submits judicial recommendations to the governor, who makes a selection from the list. Senate confirmation isn’t required, but voters later decide whether to retain those judges at the ballot box.
SB 632 also attempted to establish more stringent qualifications for business court judges, different pay and longer terms than the Oklahoma Constitution allows, the justices found. 
Justices James Winchester, James Edmondson, Douglas Combs and Richard Darby concurred with the opinion. Chief Justice Dustin Rowe concurred, but dissented in part while Vice Chief Justice Dana Kuehn and Justice Travis Jett dissented.

Vance is making a return trip to Indiana to speak with state lawmakers about mid-cycle redistricting. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Vice President JD Vance is slated to return to the Hoosier State on Friday to meet with Indiana’s Senate Republican caucus as redistricting deliberations appear to be at an impasse.
Multiple sources, including two Republican state senators, confirmed to the Indiana Capital Chronicle that Vance will meet with lawmakers in Indianapolis. The visit comes as state GOP legislators weigh a special session for mid-cycle redistricting — a move that has split some members of the party.
Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange, told the Capital Chronicle most lawmakers she’s spoken with aren’t eager to reopen the maps.
“I think everybody wants to keep an open mind,” she said. “But, you know, the general attitude all along has been that nobody has much of an appetite for redistricting. I mean, we thought the maps we did before were fair.”

President Donald Trump is pushing GOP-led states like Indiana to redraw maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House for the rest of his second term. Redistricting is typically only done after the decennial census.
Indiana’s current map is 7-2 Republicans, with Democrats holding seats in northwest and central Indiana. 
Glick also questioned the cost and optics of calling lawmakers back to Indianapolis.
“Why spend the money?” she asked. “We’re in a financial time when we’re telling every level of government to reduce spending. And then we’re thinking about spending six figures to bring us all back down there for a special session that nobody wants. It doesn’t sell well; it doesn’t feel right to do it. It doesn’t feel right to do it in terms of fairness, but it surely doesn’t feel right in terms of the financial — because there’s nothing to be gained and there’s a lot to be lost.”
The Indiana Senate Republican caucus has been largely silent about redistricting. Both House and Senate Republicans have held closed-door meetings on the topic.
The vice president’s visit will mark his second trip to Indiana in about two months. In August, Vance met with Gov. Mike Braun, Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray and House Speaker Todd Huston at the Statehouse to rally support for redistricting. Braun described the meeting as “pretty good,” but neither the governor nor legislative leadership signaled any firm commitment to the proposal.
Later that month, dozens of GOP lawmakers from Indiana’s House and Senate traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with Vance and other federal officials about a variety of topics, including redistricting. Bray and Huston met in person with Trump during that visit.
Some Hoosier legislators said those conversations played a role in their decision to change their stance.
“I want to hear him again,” said Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, referring to the vice president. “There’s a lot to consider there, and as with these roles, a lot of it’s policy and a little bit political. And this kind of slant of things is political. And, you know, those games have been played throughout history and certainly been played by our counterparts, and it’s something that maybe we haven’t done as good a job at. And I think that’s really driving the conversation.”

For most members, Glick said, the push for mid-cycle redistricting feels unnecessary.
“I don’t think there’s an appetite amongst the members of the General Assembly that I’ve talked to,” she said. “If you’re an aspiring politician and you want to go to Congress, maybe you think, well, here’s my chance. But, to be honest, for most of us — is this a fair thing to do? Is this the right thing to do?”
Braun has said repeatedly that he wants legislative leaders to reach a consensus before he would consider calling lawmakers back to the Statehouse. 
In recent interviews, the governor emphasized that his role is to support — not drive — the process.
“I want it to be where it wasn’t forced upon our legislature, have our leaders talk to their own caucus members,” he told Fort Wayne’s WOWO radio last month. He added that lawmakers needed time to “weigh what good comes from it” before committing to any redistricting effort. 
And he suggested Indiana’s relationship with the Trump administration might suffer if lawmakers don’t move forward. 
Still, the governor has floated the idea of a November special session, saying he’s been “talking to leadership in both chambers” and would consider calling lawmakers back if Republicans have the necessary votes.
Glick said lawmakers tried to balance representation across districts when the maps were last redrawn in 2021.
“Obviously, we didn’t draw them to make sure that there was a 50/50 split across the state — that’s not what you do — but you try and be fair,” Glick said. “You try and make sure that every voter is represented.”

This will be Parsons’ second stint as the top federal prosecutor in the state. He previously served in the job during the first Trump administration.
Thune congratulated Parsons in a post to X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday.
“Ron has already proved he has what it takes to be a great U.S. attorney, and I know he’ll continue to work hard for the people of South Dakota,” Thune said.
Parsons has degrees from the University of Minnesota and the University of South Dakota’s Knudson School of Law. He succeeds Alison Ramsdell, who was appointed during the Biden administration.
Parsons’ confirmation came after a Senate rule change, spearheaded by Thune, that allows the chamber to confirm some of the president’s appointees in large batches instead of one at a time. The change followed weeks of frustration from President Donald Trump and numerous Republican senators, who were exasperated by Democrats slowing down the confirmation process for lower-ranking nominees.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been clear about her desire to shut down the agency she runs. She’s laid off half the staff and joked about padlocking the door.
She calls it “the final mission.”
But the department is not behaving like an agency that is simply winding down. Even as McMahon has shrunk the Department of Education, she’s operated in what she calls “a parallel universe” to radically shift how children will learn for years to come. The department’s actions and policies reflect a disdain for public schools and a desire to dismantle that system in favor of a range of other options — private, Christian and virtual schools or homeschooling.
Over just eight months, department officials have opened a $500 million tap for charter schools, a huge outlay for an option that often draws children from traditional public schools. They have repeatedly urged states to spend federal money for poor and at-risk students at private schools and businesses. And they have threatened penalties for public schools that offer programs to address historic inequities for Black or Hispanic students.

McMahon has described her agency moving “at lightning rocket speed,” and the department’s actions in just one week in September reflect that urgency.
The agency publicly blasted four school districts it views as insubordinate for refusing to adopt anti-trans policies and for not eliminating special programs for Black students. It created a pot of funding dedicated to what it calls “patriotic education,” which has been criticized for downplaying some of the country’s most troubling episodes, including slavery. And it formed a coalition with Turning Point USA, Hillsdale College, PragerU and dozens of other conservative groups to disseminate patriotic programming.
Officials at the Education Department declined to comment or answer questions from ProPublica for this story.
At times, McMahon has voiced support for public schools. But more often and more emphatically she has portrayed public schools as unsuccessful and unsafe — and has said she is determined to give parents other options.
To carry out her vision, McMahon has brought on at least 20 political appointees from ultraconservative think tanks and advocacy groups eager to de-emphasize public schools, which have educated students for roughly 200 years.
Among them is top adviser Lindsey Burke, a longtime policy director at The Heritage Foundation and the lead author of the education section in Project 2025’s controversial agenda for the Trump administration.
In analyzing dozens of hours of audio and video footage of public and private speaking events for McMahon’s appointees, as well as their writings, ProPublica found that a recurring theme is the desire to enable more families to leave public schools. This includes expanding programs that provide payment — in the form of debit cards, which Burke has likened to an “Amazon gift card” — to parents to cobble together customized educational plans for their children. Instead of relying on public schools, parents would use their allotted tax dollars on a range of costs: private school tuition, online learning, tutors, transportation and music lessons.
More than 8 in 10 elementary and secondary students in the U.S. go to a traditional public school. But Burke expects that public schools will see dramatic enrollment declines fueled by both demographic and policy changes.
Addressing an interviewer in an April podcast, she noted: “We’re going to have a lot of empty school buildings.”
In a 2024 podcast, Noah Pollak, now a senior adviser in the Education Department, bemoaned what he sees as progressive control of schools, which he said has led to lessons he finds unacceptable, such as teaching fourth graders about systemic racism.
“And so the work that I do is trying to come up with creative policy ideas to stop that, to turn back the tide, to figure out ways that conservatives can protect these institutions or build new institutions,” said Pollak, who has been an adviser to conservative groups.
As tax dollars are reallocated from public school districts and families abandon those schools to learn at home or in private settings, the new department officials see little need for oversight. Instead, they would let the marketplace determine what’s working using tools such as Yelp-like reviews from parents. Burke has said she is against “any sort of regulation.”
President Donald Trump himself said in July that the federal government needs only to provide “a little tiny bit of supervision but very little, almost nothing,” over the nation’s education system except to make sure students speak English.
Advocates for public schools consider them fundamental to American democracy. Providing public schools is a requirement in every state constitution.
Families in small and rural communities tend to rely more heavily on public education. They are less likely than families in cities to have private and charter schools nearby. And unlike private schools, public school districts don’t charge tuition. Public schools enroll local students regardless of academic or physical ability, race, gender or family income; private schools can selectively admit students.
Karma Quick-Panwala, a leader at the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, which advocates for disabled students, said she wants to be optimistic. “But,” she added, “I’m very fearful that we are headed towards a less inclusive, less diverse and more segregated public school setting.”
Allison Rose Socol, a policy expert at EdTrust, an organization focusing on civil rights in schools, decried what she called the “demo crew” in McMahon’s office. Socol described McMahon’s push to help grow private school enrollment through taxpayer-funded vouchers and other means as a “great American heist” that will funnel money away from the public system.
“It’s a strategic theft of the future of our country, our kids and our democracy,” she said.

Attention on McMahon often focuses on her former role as CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment. It was no different on the day of her Senate confirmation hearing, when journalists and social media delighted in noting that seated behind her was her son-in-law, the retired wrestler known as Triple H.
Little attention was paid to the conservative education activists in the front row from Moms for Liberty, which has protested school curricula and orchestrated book bans nationwide; Defending Education (formerly Parents Defending Education), which has sued districts to fight what it calls liberal indoctrination; and the America First Policy Institute, co-founded by McMahon after the first Trump administration.
Now two people who once served at Defending Education have been named to posts in the Education Department, and leaders from Moms for Liberty have joined McMahon for roundtables and other official events. In addition, at least nine people from the America First Policy Institute have been hired in the department.
AFPI’s sweeping education priorities include advocating for school vouchers and embedding biblical principles in schools. It released a policy paper in 2023, titled “Biblical Foundations,” that sets out the organization’s objective to end the separation of church and state and “plant Jesus in every space.”
The paper rejects the idea that society has a collective responsibility to educate all children equally and argues that “the Bible makes it clear that it is parents alone who shoulder the responsibility for their children.” It frames public schooling as failing, with low test scores and “far-left social experiments, such as gender fluidity.”
The first AFPI leader pictured in that report is McMahon.
AFPI and the other two nonprofit groups sprang up only after the 2020 election. Together they drew in tens of millions of dollars through a well-coordinated right-wing network that had spent decades advocating for school choice and injecting Christianity into schools.
Ultrawealthy supporters include right-wing billionaire Richard Uihlein, who, through a super PAC, gave $336,000 to Moms for Liberty’s super PAC from October 2023 through July 2024.
Defending Education and AFPI received backing from some of the same prominent conservative foundations and trusts, including ones linked to libertarian-minded billionaire Charles Koch and to conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, an architect of the effort to strip liberal influence from the courts, politics and schools.
Maurice T. Cunningham, a now-retired associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts, studied the origins and connections of parents’ rights groups, finding in 2023 that the funders — a small set of billionaires and Christian nationalists — had similar goals.
The groups want “to undermine teachers unions, protect their wealthy donors from having to contribute their fair share in taxes to strengthen public schools, and provide profit opportunities through school privatization,” he concluded. The groups say they are merely trying to advocate for parents and for school choice. They didn’t discuss their relationship with donors when contacted by ProPublica.
These groups and their supporters now have access to the top levers of government, either through official roles in the agency or through the administration’s adoption of their views.
When the department created an “End DEI” portal to collect tips about diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in schools, it quoted Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice in the press release. She encouraged parents to “share the receipts of the betrayal that has happened in our public schools.” Moms for Liberty referred to the portal as the “culmination” of Justice’s work. (Federal judges ruled against some of the administration’s anti-DEI actions and the department took the controversial portal down in May.)
Asked what percentage of children she imagines should be in public schools going forward, Justice, who is now with The Heritage Foundation’s political advocacy arm, told ProPublica: “I hope zero. I hope to get to zero.”
She and others say most public schools don’t teach students to read, are dividing children over race and are secretly helping students to change genders — familiar claims that have been widely challenged by educators.
When Trump signed an executive order in March to dismantle the Education Department, Justice sat in the first row, as she had at McMahon’s confirmation hearing. The president praised her, along with various governors and lawmakers. “She’s been a hard worker,” he said.
Defending Education’s Nicole Neily, who was also at McMahon’s confirmation, stood next to McMahon when the secretary announced an investigation into the Maine Department of Education for keeping records from parents about student gender identity plans. Defending Education has filed civil rights complaints against colleges and school districts and has been successful in having its causes taken up by the Trump administration.
In an email, Neily told ProPublica she is proud of the work that Defending Education has done to challenge schools that have supported DEI in their curricula and have allowed students to hide their gender identity from parents. She singled out teacher unions and “radical education activists” while blaming drops in student achievement on “the education-industrial complex.”
“The sooner this stranglehold is broken, the better,” she wrote.
McMahon’s tenure also has been marked by an embrace of religion in schools. She signaled that priority when she appointed Meg Kilgannon to a top post in her office.
Kilgannon had worked in the department as director of a faith initiative during the first Trump term and once was part of the Family Research Council, an evangelical think tank that opposes abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.
She has encouraged conservative Christians to become involved in what she’s described as “a spiritual war” over children and what they’re being taught in public schools.
Reached by phone, Kilgannon told ProPublica, “I have no comment,” and hung up.

Betsy DeVos, the Michigan billionaire who was education secretary in Trump’s first term, cheered on July 4 this year when Congress instituted America’s first federal voucher program. It came in the form of a generous tax credit program to encourage voucher expansion at the state level. Families can start accessing the aid beginning Jan. 1, 2027.
DeVos once said she wanted “to advance God’s kingdom” through vouchers for religious schools and has funneled vast amounts of her family fortune into advocating for school choice. She called the passage of the federal measure “the turning point in ending the one-size-fits-all government school monopoly.”
An article in The Federalist, a conservative publication, boiled down the implications into one headline: “How Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill Will Help Kids Escape Failing Government Schools.”
But school choice isn’t the only tool that Trump’s education leaders are using to target public schools. McMahon has gutted the Education Department’s civil rights division, where lawyers and other federal employees work to ensure all students can access public school, free from discrimination.
The administration rolled back protections for LGBTQ+ students and students of color, prioritized investigating discrimination against white and Jewish students, and launched aggressive investigations of states and districts that it says refused to stop accommodating transgender students.
It has rescinded official guidance that said schools had to provide language help and other services for students who are learning English, contradicting long-established federal law.
And Trump officials have repeatedly cast public schools as dangerous even as the agency canceled about $1 billion in training grants for more school mental health professionals — money that had been authorized by Congress to help prevent school shootings. The administration now says it plans to resume paying out a fraction of that funding, which would be used for school psychologists.
Over and over, the department has used the threat of pulling federal funding to force compliance with new directives and rapid shifts in policy. The department, for instance, threatened to withhold money from schools that did not verify they were ending diversity initiatives, which were designed to address inequitable treatment of Black, Native and Latino students.
In August, the department announced it was withholding millions of dollars in grants from five northern Virginia school districts that had refused the department’s demands to bar transgender students from using restrooms and locker rooms that aligned with their gender identity. The districts argued that complying would mean defying Virginia law and a 2020 federal appeals court ruling.
Nevertheless, the Education Department told the districts that until they acquiesced to the agency’s bathroom rules they would have to pay expenses up front and request reimbursement. McMahon wrote to districts that “Lindsey Burke is available to answer any questions.”
The Fairfax County Public Schools sued and in a legal filing said it faced losing $167 million this school year, money that it was relying on to provide meals to students, support programs for children with disabilities, help English-language learners and enhance teacher training. The federal department has argued that it has discretion to withhold funding and admonished the district for taking the agency to court.
In this atmosphere, public school advocates are particularly concerned about what will happen to funding for Title I grants, which is the federal government’s largest program for schools and is aimed at helping students from low-income families. In early September, House Republicans proposed slashing more than $5 billion from the $18.4 billion earmarked for Title I, putting at risk reading and math teachers, tutors and classroom technology.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At the same time, under McMahon, the Education Department is trying to redefine how states and districts can spend the money.
In three guidance letters so far this year, the agency encouraged states to divert some Title I money away from public school districts. One suggested paying for outside services, such as privatized tutoring. Another urged states to use Title I money to benefit low-achieving students who live within the boundaries of a high-poverty public school but attend private schools.
McMahon is prepared to loosen even more rules on the money. The federal dollars currently are distributed to districts using a formula. Project 2025 calls for Title I to be delivered to states as block grants, or chunks of money with few restrictions. McMahon has encouraged states to ask her to waive rules on spending the money.
Critics of this approach fear that Title I money could eventually be used in ways that undermine public schools — on private school vouchers, for example.
Public school advocates like William Phillis, a former official at the Ohio Department of Education, fear the change would devastate public schools.
“I just know any block grant or any funding that would be left up to state officials on Title I money would be misappropriated in terms of the intent,” Phillis said. “Block grants to Ohio would go to the private sector.”
A spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce did not respond to requests for comment.
Rainey Briggs, chief of operations for Des Moines Public Schools in Iowa, said he supports parental choice but worries that public schools will suffer financially and will not have the resources to stay up to date.
And he fears that right-wing narratives around public schools, the distrust and lack of support for highly trained district leaders — whether from some parents or politicians — could lead accomplished educators to walk away.
“Public education is irreplaceable,” he said, citing its commitment to serve every child regardless of their background or circumstance.
Those influencing Trump’s education agenda disagree.
“If America’s public schools cease to exist tomorrow, America would be a better place,” Justice told ProPublica.

,California,2025-10-08 15:13:43+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom signs bill to prevent sex abuse in schools,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/10/school-sex-abuse-california/,"The law requires a database intended to stop teachers facing credible accusations of abuse from quitting and getting rehired at another school, potentially abusing more children.","In summary
The law requires a database intended to stop teachers facing credible accusations of abuse from quitting and getting rehired at another school, potentially abusing more children. 


California’s K-12 schools will take far-ranging steps to prevent sexual abuse on campus — including building a database of teachers under investigation for misconduct — under a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.
 Senate Bill 848, sponsored by state Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, a Democrat from Alhambra, stems from a slew of recent lawsuits over sexual abuse in California schools, as well as a news report on decades of sexual abuse by at least a dozen teachers at a high school in her district.
“I’m proud to see this bill move forward. It’s been really personal for me,” said Pérez, who recently told CalMatters that she was the victim of a teacher’s inappropriate interest while she was in high school. “For survivors, this is an important step toward justice.”
The law goes into effect Jan. 1, and applies to all K-12 schools in California, including private schools. 
Among other things, the law requires schools to train teachers, coaches and other school staff on how to prevent and report sexual misconduct; broadens the number of staff who are required to report abuse allegations; and requires schools to write comprehensive policies on appropriate behavior. 
But the database is perhaps the most significant change. Administered by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, the database is intended to stop teachers facing credible accusations of abuse from quitting and getting rehired at another school, potentially abusing more children. The database will be available to schools as part of their employee screening process, and would be updated if allegations against a teacher prove to be unfounded.
Although sexual abuse has long occurred in schools, the extent of the problem came to light in 2020 after the passage of AB 218, which made it easier for victims to sue school districts and other government agencies over sexual abuse. The law opened a floodgate of lawsuits that have so far cost California schools more than $3 billion and brought some districts to the brink of insolvency. 
Another bill’s failure
The large payouts inspired another bill this year, which would have provided some relief for school districts faced with lawsuits over decades-old abuse claims while still allowing victims to be compensated. Senate bill SB 577, sponsored by State Sen. John Laird, a Democrat from Santa Cruz, stalled in the Assembly. 
The bill didn’t cap settlements or attorney fees, but it called for a statute of limitations on older incidents and would have made it easier for school districts to issue bonds to pay settlements, which in California have mostly ranged from $5 million to $10 million.
“I am disappointed that SB 577 will not be advancing this year,” Laird said in an email. “I had hoped to protect survivors’ access to justice while finding some fiscal relief to local governments. Despite these months of hard work, it was just impossible to balance these interests to get to a successful outcome this year.”
Laird said he hopes to resurrect the bill next year.
Financial hardships for districts
School districts were devastated by SB 577’s failure. Some had canceled preschool programs and field trips, frozen salaries or laid off staff and taken other steps to pay legal settlements. The expenses come at a difficult time for schools, as pandemic relief grants have recently expired and enrollment continues to decline in many parts of the state. 
Montecito Union School District, a 350-student district near Santa Barbara, last month settled an abuse lawsuit for $7.5 million — nearly half its annual budget — for alleged sexual abuse by a former staff member between 1972 and 1978. 
Nearby Carpinteria Unified has also been affected.
“We are very frustrated that legislators failed to assist California school districts who have been forced to defend themselves against decades-old claims, spending millions of dollars that impact current students and families,” said Diana Rigby, superintendent of Carpinteria Unified. “Our district has been severely impacted by the financial burden of defending four lawsuits from the 1970s.”
Advocates for SB 577 said that trial attorneys were behind the bill’s failure. Attorneys earn up to 30% to 40% on legal settlements, and have been advertising around California in search of people who were abused in schools. 
In the final days of the legislative session, ads circulated on social media featuring a photo of Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas with the words, “Stop the Predator Protection Law” and “Stand with child victims.” The ads were paid for by the law firm Manly, Stewart & Finaldi, a national firm with offices in Irvine and Riverside, which specializes in sex abuse claims.
John Manly, a partner in the firm, said he bought the ads to pressure Rivas to reject the bill.
“If I have to spend every last dime to protect a child from being abused, I will do that,” Manly said. “I’ve spent my career doing this, and I’m not going to stop.”
Manly, the lead attorney in the lawsuit against former Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar, said he’d fight any legislation that curbs abuse lawsuits. He also said Pérez’s bill doesn’t go far enough: it should include felony charges for mandated reporters who fail to report suspected abuse, and it should require school districts to publish the names of staff who’ve been “credibly accused” of sexual misconduct.  
He expects the fight to continue next year and beyond.
Consumer Attorneys of California, a lobbying group, was neutral on Laird’s bill.
“Although CAOC had no official position on the bill, we thought it struck the right balance between protecting survivors’ rights and addressing issues relating to public entities,” said Jonathan Underland, spokesperson for Consumer Attorneys of California. “We were disappointed to see that it did not cross the finish line.”
Eventually, state political leaders will have to take action on abuse lawsuits because too many schools and government agencies are facing insolvency, endangering programs that millions of people rely on, said Ben Adler, public affairs director for the California State Association of Counties.
“God bless Senator Laird for taking this on. It was a thankless task,” Adler said. “Moving forward, there has to be a way to ensure justice for survivors without bankrupting schools and counties, which provide a social safety net. The governor and the Legislature will have to get everyone in a room to figure this thing out.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/051122_St-Hope-Charter-School_MG_CM-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 11:59:10.544113

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The Bank of North Dakota announced Wednesday plans to launch the Roughrider coin, the state’s first stablecoin.
Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that can facilitate instant money transfers, streamline bank-to-bank transactions and, potentially, be used by North Dakotans in daily life down the road. Unlike bitcoin, stablecoin is not subject to volatile price swings because it’s backed by conventional financial assets, overwhelmingly the U.S. dollar.
North Dakota’s state-owned bank is partnering with Fiserv, a Fortune 500 financial technology company, to introduce stablecoin into the state’s banking system, officials announced at a conference in Bismarck. 
Bank of North Dakota President and CEO Don Morgan said the move aims to ensure “the continued health, resilience and relevancy” of North Dakota banks and credit unions.
“We have a 106-year history of commitment to North Dakota agriculture, commerce, and industry through our financial institution partnerships,” Morgan said in a statement. “The development of the Roughrider coin reflects that commitment.”
The first test of the stablecoin in North Dakota banks and credit unions is expected to occur in 2026. It will require the approval of the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which oversees the Bank of North Dakota.
“As one of the first states to issue our own stablecoin backed by real money, North Dakota is taking a cutting-edge approach to creating a secure and efficient financial ecosystem for our citizens,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the Industrial Commission, said in a statement. 
What is stablecoin?
Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology, similar to bitcoin.
Most stablecoins, like the Roughrider coin being proposed in North Dakota, are tied to the value of the U.S. dollar. Federal law requires each stablecoin in circulation to be matched by a U.S. dollar or equivalent, such as a short-term U.S. Treasury note, held in reserve by a financial institution. That’s why stablecoin is not subject to the volatile price swings of bitcoin and other popular digital assets.
This digital currency is issued, or minted, on demand as the need arises. When the owner of the stablecoin wants to redeem it, the currency is dissolved, or burned, and taken out of circulation. 
The Bank of North Dakota is envisioning stablecoins to primarily be used in bank-to-bank transactions, said Rick Geloff, the bank’s executive vice president. Money transfers that used to take days will be able to take place within minutes, he said. 
“That’s what we’re trying to make sure that our financial institutions in North Dakota can do is move that money quicker and more efficiently,” Geloff said.
The name Roughrider honors the volunteer military unit led by President Theodore Roosevelt. 
Will banking customers see a difference?
Customers are unlikely to notice any significant differences in their banking experience as a result of the Roughrider coin’s implementation, Geloff said, because most of the changes will take place behind the scenes.
While stablecoins are used elsewhere in the world in daily transactions with a merchant or retailer, that’s not the goal of North Dakota’s Roughrider coin initially. 
“This would be more of the back end, helping banks facilitate payments to each other,” Geloff said. 
That could change in the future if retailers and other businesses begin accepting stablecoin as a form of payment. 
Dan McGonegle, senior manager of the digital assets team at accounting and consulting firm Crowe, said one advantage to stablecoin from a merchant’s perspective may be significantly lower transaction fees. Merchants have to pay fees to process payments made with credit or debit cards. Stablecoin potentially offers a cheaper alternative, he said. If merchants choose to encourage customers to use the digital currency as a way to lower their costs, that could speed up widespread adoption. 
“If I’m a large merchant, then I may have real incentive to encourage my customers to transact in stablecoins,” McGonegle said. “I think it still remains to be seen how that could all play out.”
Earlier this year, Wyoming took a different approach and launched its own stablecoin known as the Frontier Stable Token. Geloff said this is an example of stablecoins being marketed for use by the public. 
Stablecoin has been more widely adopted in countries where the traditional currency is volatile, such as Venezuela and Argentina, Geloff said. 
Why now?
The Bank of North Dakota began exploring stablecoin after federal legislation, called the Genius Act, was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. 
This law created 80% of the federal regulatory framework for stablecoin, Geloff said, providing certainty and safeguards that have made it possible for mainstream financial institutions to begin considering using it.
It’s a new financial tool that offers a lot of potential, but can be daunting to begin using, said Kelvin Hullet, the bank’s chief business development officer. So the bank, like it did when the internet was introduced to the banking world, is doing the legwork on behalf of its local banking partners to ensure they can take advantage, he said.
The Bank of North Dakota is working with Fiserv to create the Roughrider coin, hosted on Fiserv’s digital asset platform, for use in bank-to-bank money transfers. 
The bank will present an analysis to the North Dakota Industrial Commission about how banks will use the new tool, a risk assessment to ensure the appropriate safeguards are in place, and cost projections. 
If the plan is approved, the Bank of North Dakota will roll out a pilot project with a handful of local financial institutions as partners. 
The federal Genius Act was a signal that the bank needed to consider adopting the technology or get left behind, Hullet said.
“Congress has now put a framework around this. The train is leaving the station, and we need to be not only on the train, but we need to bring our local financial institutions along with us, so that they are able to utilize this new technology as it moves forward,” Hullet said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Alleging that it violates multiple provisions of the Florida Constitution, an environmental group and an Orange County resident have filed a lawsuit to block enforcement of a new state law that restricts local governments from regulating development.
It is the second such lawsuit filed in the past two weeks aimed at Senate Bill 180, a measure sponsored by Pinellas County Republican state Sen. Nick DiCeglie that passed during the 2025 legislative session and was signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis ostensibly to aid in hurricane recovery.
The smart-growth group 1000 Friends of Florida and east Orange County resident Rachel Hildebrand are the plaintiffs, represented by Broward County land-use attorney Richard Grosso. They filed their request for declaratory and injunctive relief on Tuesday in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County.
The measure bans local governments from adopting “more restrictive or burdensome” land-use or zoning rules for three years following the 2024 hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton — that is, until October 2027.  The lawsuit notes that the law “also allows ‘any person’ to sue to invalidate a plan, amendment, regulation or development order without needing to show that they are impacted by it in any way, and to receive attorney’s fees and costs if they succeed.”
The complaint alleges that SB 180 violates the single-subject rule by bundling unrelated policy changes into an emergency-management bill; is arbitrary and capricious because its prohibition is triggered by random, unrelated hurricanes; is unconstitutionally vague by broadly prohibiting undefined “more restrictive or burdensome” planning measures; and is inconsistent with the Florida Constitution’s “natural resources” clause by blocking local actions needed to protect air, water, and sensitive lands.
“SB 180 goes far beyond disaster recovery. It undermines communities of the basic ability to plan responsibly for growth, infrastructure, and the environment,” said Paul Owens, president of 1000 Friends. “Voters and local officials across the state are being silenced just when Florida most needs smart, resilient planning.”
Hildebrand lives with her family in the Lake Pickett Rural Settlement of Orange County, within an area identified as rural under the county’s “rural boundary” comprehensive plan provisions, which voters approved as a charter amendment in 2024.
In June 2025, Orange County Commissioners adopted changes to the comprehensive plan including additional protections for certain lands, like Hildebrand’s, within the rural boundary. Pursuant to Florida’s Community Planning Act, Orange County submitted those amendments to the Florida Department of Commerce for its statutorily required review. On July 28, that department declared that the comprehensive plan amendments were “null and void,” citing Senate bill 180.
In a press release announcing the lawsuit, 1000 Friends says that more than a dozen local governments across Florida have received similar letters from the Department of Commerce, declaring their proposed planning or land-use policy changes also “null and void” under SB 180. In many cases, the group alleges that those local updates were designed to strengthen stormwater management, protect natural resources, or prevent urban sprawl.
“We’ve done everything right to protect our rural community, but the state’s actions are stripping away those safeguards,” Hildebrand said in a written statement. “This fight is about ensuring our local voice is heard and that our children can inherit the safe, natural environment we’ve worked so hard to preserve.”
Twenty-five local governments filed a similar lawsuit last week attempting to block provisions of SB 180 from taking effect.
Speaking during an event hosted by the Tampa Bay Beaches Chamber of Commerce last month, Sen. DiCigle acknowledged his law “has been a hot topic.”
“Most of that had to do with planning and recovery efforts,” he said. “We’re going to potentially have to make some adjustments to clarify some of the language in that bill.
The defendants are Florida Secretary of Commerce J. Alex Kelly, Department of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson, Florida Department of Revenue Executive Director Jim Zingale, and Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia.

RUTLAND CITY — Marble City voters signed off on a $3.9 million bond for city infrastructure upgrades, laying the groundwork for a hotel project and other development downtown.
A sweeping 85% of Rutland voters approved the bond during the special vote held Tuesday, with 1,190 ballots cast in favor and 213 against, according to an unofficial tally released by the clerk’s office.
“It’s a really exciting message that the voters recognize how important these types of infrastructure upgrades are to the future development of our city,” said Rutland City Mayor Mike Doenges Wednesday morning.

The bond will go towards funding the repair of aging wastewater pipes, burying power lines and widening sidewalks in the city’s downtown area. The infrastructure upgrade is the first phase in a master plan crafted through the establishment of the city’s Tax Increment Financing, or TIF, district. The TIF district was approved by the city’s Board of Aldermen and the Vermont Economic Progress Council earlier this year, said Doenges. 
For the next 10 years, the TIF district designation allows Rutland to undertake a large-scale revitalization effort. The city will be able to take out debt for infrastructure upgrades, brownfield remediation and other city projects that are tied to private development proposals, but in a way that is intended to keep taxpayers off the hook for the cost.
The infrastructure upgrades will enable private developers to construct a four-story hotel project in a section of downtown Rutland called “the pit,” which has remained a vacant lot since a fire destroyed the townhouse hotel at the corner of Center Street and Wales Street in 1973.
Rutland resident Bradford Morgan said he voted in favor of the TIF bond because he thinks the economic development tool is a sound strategy to make a much-needed fix to the wastewater infrastructure in the city. Morgan added that more than five decades is far too long for “the pit” at the heart of downtown to remain undeveloped.
“I think it’s a smart idea to make a commitment to pay off a bond, but you get the money first,” Morgan said. “The odds are really good that the investment made by it will pay for itself, and it’s time to fill in that hole in the ground since the townhouse fire.”
On the other hand, city resident Steven Rider said that he voted against the TIF bond because he is worried that the financing model will not pan out for future taxpayers. Rider said he thinks that the private developers should take on the costs of the projects necessary to make way for a hotel.
“I didn’t vote (for) it because it’s a tax in the future, and I don’t believe in them burdening the taxes on our future generation,” Rider said. “Right now, the downtown is already set as is.”
Unlike a typical city bond that falls on city property tax payers, the newly approved bond — financed through the Tax Increment Financing model — will be paid back through the additional tax revenue produced by the hotel property over the course of 20 years. A portion of the difference in tax revenue, or tax increment, will also go toward the municipal general fund and the state’s education fund. 
A TIF bond for future projects also must be greenlit by the Vermont Economic Progress Council and the city voters and will be funded by the increased tax revenue of other developments within the district lines, said Doenges. 
While the city will break ground on infrastructure projects next spring, the approval of the bond by Rutland voters means the private developers who have agreed to take on the hotel project have the go ahead to start cleaning up the site even earlier, said Doenges.
Another supportive Rutland resident, Beverly Boston, said she voted in favor of the TIF bond because, if it hadn’t been approved, the cost of replacing the deteriorating wastewater lines would fall on property taxpayers, who have “already been hit so hard.”
Eric Lapp, a resident since 1998, said that he voted in favor of the TIF bond because he said changes are already afoot in Rutland, with the Diamond Run Mall closing nearly six years ago and the proposed Walmart relocation away from the city center. An improved wastewater system will facilitate more development which will, in turn, cultivate more business growth and tourism to Rutland’s downtown in the future, Lapp said.
“If the hotel goes through and is successful, it’s going to be a big boost,” Lapp said. “Rutland needs to grow and change, and there’s a lot of debate on both sides of the coin here, but on balance, I think it’s something we should at least give a try.”
Rutland resident Becky Pell said she voted in favor of the bond because she believes the downtown revitalization effort will help the local economy thrive. 
“I think it’s important that this bond go through. I think it’s going to increase our ability to keep Rutland alive,” Pell said. “It’s been hard for Rutlanders to keep businesses here, and we need that. Plus, we need the infrastructure.”

Because the Census determines the number of seats each state is allotted in Congress – as well as federal funding for certain programs – officials in Massachusetts are under more pressure this cycle to make sure that every resident is counted. 
“This work never really stops,” Sen. William Brownsberger, who leads the Senate Committee on the Census, said in an interview. 
Democrats who control the political map-drawing process in Massachusetts have no plans to reshape the state’s congressional districts partway through the decade. (California voters will decide in a November 4 special election whether to temporarily redraw their maps to shift five Republican seats to Democrats, a measure Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed for to offset the Texas changes.) 
Yet there’s still plenty of labor ahead for state and municipal leaders, who need to ensure every new housing unit built in the past five years is on the Census Bureau’s radar, convince their constituents to answer questions about themselves during a period of aggressive immigration enforcement, and monitor population trends for a hint at whether Massachusetts might gain or lose a seat in the US House, where all nine of the state’s representatives are Democrats. 
That’s a particular sticking point for President Donald Trump, who took aim at the Bay State this summer, contending that Massachusetts has highly gerrymandered districts and that his vote share (about 36 percent in 2024) should have translated into at least one GOP representative in Congress. 
Most Republicans in the state House and Senate supported the congressional map drawn after the last Census, and GOP Gov. Charlie Baker signed it into law. 
“Massachusetts is a state in which there are a percentage of people who vote for Donald Trump, but those people are distributed across the state in every district, so redrawing the districts wouldn’t really change the balance at all,” Brownsberger said. “There’s very little prospect of cooking the books to elect a Republican.” 
Just past the midpoint in the decade, much of the Census preparation focuses on housing. Brownsberger said the Census Bureau develops a list of “every single housing unit in the country,” which becomes the primary foundation for the actual population count. 
“That list is incredibly important, and getting it right is not easy,” Brownsberger said. “Addresses are constantly being added as new construction happens. Addresses are being taken away as demolitions happen and as buildings are replaced. It’s not easy to know what’s inside any given apartment building.” 
Cities and towns will get a chance in the next few years to influence the Census Bureau’s master address file. 
Susan Strate, senior program manager of the UMass Donahue Institute’s population estimates program, said getting the most accurate housing inventory possible is critical to the population count.  
New York state lost a U.S. House seat and an Electoral College vote after the 2020 Census after falling 89 residents short of the amount needed to keep its delegation at the same size. 
“We know that just a handful of missing addresses has the potential to have a really large impact,” Strate said at a hearing Brownsberger’s committee hosted on September 22. 
Some communities, especially those that are larger and wealthier, are more prepared for this work as they have experienced staff who have been around for multiple Census cycles. Others have limited expertise on hand; Brownsberger described one town that uses “basically a Post-It note system” for tracking new addresses. 
The state’s fiscal year 2026 budget includes nearly $1.3 million for “technical assistance” with Census preparation, but Brownsberger said the Legislature “probably [is] going to need to continue to put money into that, maybe even more money.”  
Another variable is that the state’s housing inventory in 2030 will be different than it was in 2020, especially if the Healey administration’s goal of generating significant new production to drive down prices proves successful. That means more homes need to get properly tracked and added to Census Bureau’s master list. 
Much of the latest housing construction has been multifamily, Brownsberger said, where getting an exact count of new units “is not going to be easy.” 
Since the last decennial Census, Beacon Hill has tried to spur more development with funding and some policy reforms such as allowing accessory dwelling units by right on all single-family properties across the state. 
ADUs, sometimes known as in-law suites, are additional structures built on a homeowner’s property where others can live. In the first six months of 2025, local officials in 170 communities approved construction of at least 550 ADUs, Healey’s office announced last month. 
Because they are added onto existing single-family lots, officials could have a trickier time tracking each of those new units in the latest housing inventory compared to larger, more obvious developments. 
Brownsberger said he expects his committee to host additional hearings in the coming months about several other pressure points, including the accuracy of Census measurements, how the Bay State’s population is trending halfway through the decade, and changes to how the Census asks about race and ethnicity. 
Under changes approved by the Biden administration, the 2030 Census will ask participants a single question about their “race and/or ethnicity” to which they can select multiple replies, including Latino and a new “Middle Eastern or North African” category. That’s a change from past iterations, which asked separately about Hispanic or Latino origin. 
Many local leaders warn that the Trump administration’s ramped-up deportation campaign could instill fear in immigrant communities. If some immigrants are unwilling to participate in the Census, it could leave Massachusetts undercounted and therefore at greater risk of losing a congressional seat or federal funding. 
“Trying to build that trust is always a challenge. It’s going to be an especially difficult challenge in the wake of the current immigration enforcement,” Brownsberger said. “Even if that enforcement stops or changes or is better focused on people with criminal backgrounds, that has done a lot of harm to people’s willingness to talk to government officials.” 
Some activists warn that certain segments of the country, especially Hispanic and Latino communities, could be further discouraged from participating if the Census Bureau adds a question about citizenship status. 
The first Trump administration sought to ask about citizenship during the 2020 Census, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the effort. Many Republicans appear to be eyeing another push for the upcoming cycle. 
How the federal government resolves those points of contention will carry massive downstream impacts. 
“The Census,” said Strate, “is about data, money, and power.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/brownsberger-census.jpg?fit=1000%2C671&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 10:56:17.698157
,California,2025-10-08 14:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Community Engagement,sponsor,,,,,https://calmatters.org/sponsored/2025/10/community-engagement/,Nearly seven in ten registered CA voters want more engagement with state leaders. How can we move beyond hosting pro forma town halls to more creatively connect communities and government?,"We have all heard the stories about Americans’ low rates of political participation and how disconnected we are from government. In the 2024 presidential election, tens of millions of registered voters chose not to cast their vote. Even fewer participate in other ways, like volunteering for campaigns and writing letters to our elected officials. But in a recent POLITICO-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab poll, we found that 68% of registered California voters said they would like more opportunities to share their experiences and ideas with leaders in state government. 

Read the Brief: California Issues Survey
At the same time, many California voters say that government policies just aren’t working as they are currently designed and implemented. In fact, in the same survey, we find that a majority believe government policies themselves are contributing to, rather than addressing, some of our most fundamental economic challenges. Fully 82% say state policies are driving prices higher and about 81% say the same about federal policies.
To improve government policies and programs, we need to more meaningfully engage communities in the process of helping to solve the problems we face as a state and a nation.
Outside of elections, the current approach to community engagement – in both California and across the country – is usually to ask residents to take time out of their busy days to voice their opinions at public meetings and town halls, and then to hope that elected representatives reflect their input when it comes time to make decisions. This system is outdated, dysfunctional, and only incorporates the views of those who have the time and resources to participate in the policymaking process. Moreover, it does little to ensure real accountability to the diverse perspectives, experiences, and beliefs of our state’s population. 
In the context of increasing political polarization, low levels of trust in government, and increasing income inequality, it is increasingly urgent that everyday residents have better ways to effectively participate in shaping the future for their communities and the future of California. 
It’s time for community engagement efforts to do more than check a box just to be able to say that it happened. If we want true people-centered policymaking, we need to design processes that let us hear the voices of people who won’t, don’t, or can’t show up at town halls, volunteer time to civic efforts, or contribute money to political campaigns.This is especially true when it comes to reaching low-income residents, communities of color, and young people, who generally show lower levels of political engagement and civic participation. 
In new research, we explore innovative examples of how California’s state government is designing civic engagement, participatory policymaking, and community outreach. With a focus on how state departments and agencies are working to connect with and empower communities, we highlight a range of recent state-led civic engagement efforts. Additionally, we identify emerging practices, tools, and strategies – ranging from digital participation platforms to equity-centered outreach models – for how state government entities are trying to create more responsive and collaborative governance. 
Our “State of Engagement” report features case studies that span youth empowerment, land use, wildfire response, and tribal relations. These examples embody three criteria that are potentially key to successful engagement:

Inclusive – Engagement addresses barriers that prevent participation, focus on collaborative governance, and/or works to build long-term trust and relationships with the community.
Intentional – Engagement has a clear purpose, goals, and intended outcomes. It focuses on a community-centered approach. There is follow-through and accountability to the input and perspectives shared by participants.
Innovative – Engagement is designed to surface ideas in new ways: whether through testing new tools and methods, forging unexpected partnerships, or exploring ways to actively include the voices of those who have previously been excluded from the policymaking process.

Read the Report: State of EngagementExplore the State of Engagement Microsite
Whether through digital democracy tools, policy cafés, participatory budgeting, pop-up kiosks, or trusted messenger networks, building new methods and platforms for public input can empower communities to share their ideas, collaborate on solutions, and influence public policies – ultimately enhancing responsiveness and deepening connections between people and their government. But perhaps most importantly, they can help us make public policies that more effectively address the critical issues shaping people’s lives.
Together, the work we highlight in our research aims to show that the voices and experiences of Californians matter. It demonstrates that trust in government is ultimately trust in people, and that systems function more effectively when those directly impacted by public problems are meaningfully involved in shaping the policies that affect their lives, families, and communities.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-08 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Mississippi likely to get $500M for rural health, with governor to set spending",Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/08/500m-rural-health-mississippi-governor-spending/,Gov. Tate Reeves will submit a proposal for spending federal money to bolster rural healthcare.,"At least $500 million is expected to flow into Mississippi over the next five years as a part of a major federal investment into rural healthcare. 
The funding aims to offset the disproportionate impact already-struggling rural hospitals are expected to bear as a result of Medicaid spending cuts signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer. 
More than half of Mississippi’s rural hospitals are at risk of closing. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves will decide what to include in the state’s one-time application for the funding, which is due in just over a month.
Reeves did not respond to Mississippi Today’s questions about his plans or priorities for the funds. 
Legislators hold the authority to appropriate money through the “power of the purse.” During a state budget hearing Sept. 24, House Speaker Jason White expressed frustration that they have not been more included in the decision-making process. 
This sets the stage for a possible conflict between the governor and legislators over who has the authority to appropriate the funds, echoing disputes that arose during the distribution of federal COVID-19 aid.

“I understand the timeline’s tight,” White said to Mississippi Medicaid Director Cindy Bradshaw. “But I also understand, I think people want to have input on what that looks like if they’re going to be appropriating the money.” 
The state Division of Medicaid and the Department of Health are supporting the governor in crafting the application.
Half of the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program will be distributed evenly among all states with approved applications, amounting to $100 million a year for five years per state if all states apply and are accepted. The other half will be allocated to states based on a variety of factors, including the rural population, the proportion of rural health facilities and the condition of hospitals.

Health care leaders told Mississippi Today they expect the discretionary funding allocations to benefit Mississippi, where most people live in rural communities and two out of three hospitals are in rural areas. 
“The key takeaway is Mississippi does do really well with this,” said Ryan Kelly, executive director of the Mississippi Rural Health Association, an organization for health professionals and advocates. 
The funding is focused on strengthening access to health care by investing in lasting improvements to preventive medicine, collaboration between health care facilities, workforce development and innovations in care and technology. 
Hospital leaders have warned that the federal cuts could force some rural hospitals to stop some services or close their doors. 
Bradshaw estimated that cuts to state directed payments, which help hospitals offset low Medicaid payments, will amount to a loss of $160 million a year beginning in 2029.
Rural hospitals may also shoulder rising costs of uninsured care if enhanced premium tax credits, which make marketplace insurance more affordable, expire at the end of this year. Over 100,000 Mississippians are expected to lose health insurance coverage if the credits are not extended.
Some advocates caution that the federal investment in rural health care will be too little to offset the losses Mississippi’s rural hospitals will face. 
“It simply won’t be enough,” said Khaylah Scott, a program manager for the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program, an organization aimed at improving health policies.
She called the program a “Band-Aid,” noting that it is temporary and will cover only about a third of the estimated losses to federal Medicaid funding in rural areas. 
Bradshaw said the new funding alone may not resolve the challenges facing rural hospitals.

“Throwing more money at hospitals I don’t think is necessarily the answer because we’ve done that the last two years and they’re still not thriving,” Bradshaw told legislative budget leaders. 
The application opened in mid-September and states must submit a plan before Nov. 5. The federal government will approve applications by the end of the year. 
“The timing is really tricky and maybe even unfortunate that we have such a short amount of time to be able to submit the application,” Bradshaw said.
Mississippi has moved quickly to solicit input from stakeholders and health leaders.
A survey released at the end of July yielded over 120 responses. Thirteen stakeholders were invited to a closed-door meeting Aug. 28 to present their ideas for the program to representatives from the governor’s office, the Division of Medicaid and the Department of Health. 
The state has not held any public meetings or hearings. Other states, including Louisiana, have held outreach meetings around the state to gain feedback from stakeholders and rural residents. 

The Mississippi Hospital Association was one of 13 organizations chosen to present ideas to the governor. 

“We feel like those funds really need to be focused on the rural hospitals to help them absorb some of the upcoming losses of those supplemental payments that have been so vital in keeping the doors open and keeping access to care alive in those rural areas,” said Richard Roberson, the association’s president and CEO.

The association has proposed using the funding for a grant to help rural hospitals cover costs of uncompensated care, improve infrastructure, create programs to recruit and retain health professionals in rural areas, expand the state’s ability to share information between providers and improve telehealth technology. 
The Mississippi Healthcare Collaborative, which represents other hospitals and health care organizations and was also invited to present at the forum, did not respond to a request for comment from Mississippi Today. 
The program will give Mississippi the opportunity to fund “ready projects” the state has been studying the past two to three years, State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney said in an interview with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. 
Department of Health spokesperson Greg Flynn declined to say which projects Edney was referencing, citing the governor’s authority to make final decisions about the application.
Kelly, of the Rural Health Association, said it is difficult to determine how to support rural health care with a large amount of funding. 
“Normally we have to find ways to do things without money,” he said. “Now, it’s like we have to flip on its head what we’ve had to do, and now we have to find a way to spend money – a lot of money. And that’s kind of a challenge.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/06140738/3X0A9397-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-08 10:56:17.698157

(Photo courtesy of Alaska Department of Corrections)A federal judge has ordered Alaska’s prison system to reconsider a transgender woman’s request to undergo surgery after declaring a state policy on the issue is so restrictive that it violates the U.S. Constitution.
The order, issued Sept. 26, follows a seven-year legal battle by Emalee Wagoner, who has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and is seeking gender confirming surgery (GCS) while in the custody of the Alaska Department of Corrections. 
Gender dysphoria is a recognized medical diagnosis for people experiencing distress when their gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. 
Magistrate Judge Matthew Scoble wrote that there was evidence that the Department of Corrections had acted with “deliberate indifference” regarding Wagoner’s gender dysphoria, and violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. 
“The record reflects that while DOC’s policies technically left room for GCS to occur, as a practical and functional matter, it was opposed to GCS in every circumstance,” Scoble said in a 47-page analysis, referring to the type of gender-affirming genital surgery sought by Wagoner and a handful of other inmates.
Scoble’s order, which does not take effect immediately, tells the Department of Corrections to halt a policy pertaining to gender dysphoria as long as it “functions as a de facto prohibition on gender affirming surgery.” 
Wagoner originally represented herself in court but later received help from Lambda Legal, a national law firm that advocates for LGBTQ+ rights. Richard Saenz was Wagoner’s attorney.
“It is a significant thing … that Ms. Wagoner should not have to continue to wait for the care that the court and her treating doctor and experts have said is medically necessary for her to receive,” he said.
Saenz said Scoble’s ruling likely will affect relatively few people, but it’s significant for them.
“We’re talking about such a small population … even within the group of people who have gender dysphoria, which is transgender people, not every transgender person with gender dysphoria needs surgical interventions,” he said.
But now, gender dysphoria surgery will be treated at the same level as cancer treatment — if a prisoner needs it, they can get it, Saenz said.
“I think that is so important — that gender dysphoria, which is a medical condition that the department itself recognizes needs treatment, should not be treated in an exceptional way. It should be treated like other medical conditions, and that the treatment that clinical guidelines say are needed, should be followed,” he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the Eighth Amendment as requiring prisons to provide medically necessary health care. In 2019, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over Alaska and other U.S. West Coast states, declared that gender-affirming surgery is covered by that interpretation. 
Had Wagoner’s case arisen in a part of the country covered by a different appeals court, the issue might have been decided differently, Scoble said.
“This Court is scrupulous to follow binding case law, and this case presents no exception,” he wrote.
Wagoner, who is serving a 40-year sentence after being convicted of serious sexual abuses. She is incarcerated at Goose Creek Correctional Center, a medium-security men’s prison at Point MacKenzie in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Alaska has a policy of housing people based on sex assigned at birth. 
Wagoner has been undergoing hormone therapy since 2022 and was recommended for surgery by her doctor.
The Department of Corrections’ medical advisory committee rejected that request in 2023, saying in part that there was “insufficient evidence to affirm that Ms. Wagoner’s mental health and well-being will decline without surgery.”
Wagoner fought that decision in court, including through a lengthy trial that took place in May in Anchorage.
Afterward, Scoble implied that he was inclined to rule in the state’s favor but that the 9th Circuit precedent decided the issue.
“In the Court’s view, a correctional facility need not necessarily offer GCS if it believes, based upon reasoned review of the ongoing science, that other treatments or therapies for gender dysphoria are effective, or if based on the state of the literature there are good-faith questions as to the ultimate effectiveness of GCS in treating gender dysphoria,” he wrote.
The Alaska Department of Law, which represented the state prison system during the case, said it intends to continue fighting the issue.
“Unfortunately, a federal magistrate judge, sitting at trial without the benefit of a local jury to hear the evidence, decided that failing to provide gender-affirming surgery is a violation of the 8th Amendment, even though there was ample testimony from medical providers and nationally-recognized experts to the contrary,” said Patty Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Law wrote by email on Tuesday. 
“The state will appeal the U.S. District Court’s decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,” she said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Photo-GCCC-in-Fall.jpg,,,2025-10-08 10:56:17.698157

Pearson, a Memphis state representative who rose to national prominence for his protest against gun violence, plans to challenge longtime U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen in the 2026 Democratic primary.
The Tennessee Lookout confirmed from multiple sources that Pearson will announce his campaign Wednesday. The campaign had not made a public announcement at the time of publication. 
Pearson, 30, began his political career as a community organizer, working to oppose the construction of a Byhalia oil pipeline through a historically Black neighborhood in Memphis, and leveraged the work into a successful run for state House in a 2023 special election.
A month after his term started, three adults and three children were killed in a shooting at Nashville’s Covenant School. Pearson and Rep. Justin Jones, a Nashville Democrat, led a series of protests that ultimately resulted in their expulsion from the state House. The duo, along with Knoxville state Rep. Gloria Johnson, were branded as the “Tennessee Three.”
In the weeks after his removal, Pearson significantly expanded his profile with a series of TV appearances and a meeting with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. He was reappointed to the state House by the Shelby County Commission a week after his expulsion and subsequently reelected.
Cohen, 76, began his career in the Tennessee State Senate in the 1980s, serving for over two decades before his successful run for the 9th Congressional District in 2006. He’s considered a consistent Democratic and liberal vote in the U.S. House.
Cohen supports abortion rights, voted for the Affordable Care Act, pushed for the legalization of marijuana and voted to impeach Donald Trump twice during the president’s first term.
Cohen has faced several primary challenges since his election to Congress, dispatching them with ease.
The Cohen-Pearson race will serve as the latest test between older and younger Democrats, as the party looks to reclaim the House majority in the 2026 midterm elections. No matter which man wins the primary, the Memphis U.S. Congressional seat is considered by political rating agencies as solidly Democratic. 
The 9th District, which is composed of most of Shelby County and portions of Tipton County, was designated a majority minority district in 1980 and was held by Black representatives — Harold Ford Sr. and Harold Ford Jr. — until Ford Jr. ran for U.S. Senate in 2006 and Cohen was elected. 
The primary election will be held in August, and the general election will be in November 2026.

Shortly before Pearson’s announcement, Cohen took to Facebook, where he declined to name Pearson as his challenger, instead referring to him as an “ambitious young candidate.”
“We will turn back this challenge in the Democratic Primary and go on to work with the incoming Democratic House Majority to put a stop to this runaway administration,” Cohen said in the post. “With a shutdown, an out-of-control, power-grabbing executive, and ICE and the National Guard on the streets of Memphis, this is a time for the experience and institutional knowledge that I bring to the table.”

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — When pastor Stewart Rawson first met Sherri Redmond, he thought it was strange that her ex-husband lived with her.
“I soon learned that that was who Sherri is: kind to a fault, generous to her own demise,” Rawson said Tuesday.
Redmond’s ex was sick and had nowhere else to live, the pastor said. So, she let him stay.
But two weeks before Christmas last year, Redmond was found shot to death in her Sumter home. Prosecutors charged her ex-husband with the crime, said Rawson, who leads the congregation at Sumter’s First Presbyterian Church.
The 79-year-old was one of 46 people killed in domestic violence cases across South Carolina in 2024 honored during a Tuesday ceremony.

For more than two decades, South Carolina was among states with the highest rates of women killed by men, including multiple years with the highest rate in the nation. Although the state’s rate has improved, it remained above the national average in 2023, with 1.8 of every 100,000 women killed by a man, according to the most recent report available through the Violence Policy Center.
Attorney General Alan Wilson called the names of each of the 46 victims — 35 women and 11 men — killed in incidents of domestic violence last year, as volunteers, family and friends carried cutouts representing their loved ones to stand behind him.
The Silent Witness Ceremony, which is in its 28th year, is meant to honor those victims and their families, as well as survivors of domestic violence. The ceremony, which drew several hundred people to the Statehouse on Tuesday, also brings attention to an issue that can easily get overlooked because it often happens within a person’s home, Wilson said.
Of the people honored Tuesday, 91% were killed at home. Half were parents who left behind children, Wilson said.
“This is not the future our children deserve,” Wilson said.
Laws to protect people from domestic violence are in place, but local law enforcement departments need officers who are ready to arrest those suspected of committing domestic abuse, prosecutors need to be prepared to support victims, and the General Assembly needs to elect judges who will give convicted abusers strong enough sentences to deter them from reoffending, Wilson said.

Providing resources for people with mental health issues that may affect their relationships and educating the public about how to identify domestic abuse are also important steps, Wilson said.
“At the end of the day, there are always going to be people who are going to break the law and try to skirt the system, and we want people out there who are being victimized to know that there is a way out,” Wilson said.
The ceremony served as a reminder that those killed had full lives that ended too soon, Wilson said.
Redmond, for instance, ran the kitchen at her Sumter church, “which made her a very important person,” Rawson said. She exhibited a classic Southern hospitality, even though she was born in Ohio. She left behind three adult sons, according to her obituary.

“We have a right to life, to our liberty, to our own pursuit of happiness,” Rawson said. “Many like Sherri do not have the opportunity to enjoy such freedoms, and sometimes, it’s the kind, tender, loving, forgiving heart of someone like Sherri that has to endure the unthinkable.”
There are many reasons a person experiencing domestic abuse might not tell anyone, said Niwdayra Tapia, a podcast host and survivor of domestic violence who lives in Columbia. For her, she didn’t want to see her ex-boyfriend go to jail, and she worried about what others might think of her, she said.
“I understand that sometimes it’s not as simple to let go of someone that you love and have devoted your time and energy to,” Tapia said. “However, love is not supposed to hurt, to make you feel depressed, stressed or worthless.”
After all 46 cutouts representing people killed had been placed, organizers brought a 47th out to represent those whose deaths went unrecognized or unreported as domestic violence.
“For all of those names that have been read, there are assuredly countless others that we do not know about,” said Rabbi Erik Uriarte, from Tree of Life Congregation in Columbia. “Because for every physical manifestation of that violence that appears on bodies, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of wounds that afflict us mentally, emotionally, socially, financially.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4772-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 09:56:14.387678

As it turns out, the attorney who crafted most of those contracts also represents the marijuana industry trade group, whose leaders helped create the microbusiness license program to diversify the market and ensure its benefits went to communities most impacted by the war on drugs.
Eric Walter is a St. Louis-based attorney who represents the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association and a significant percentage of the state’s cannabis licensees. He wrote 22 agreements the state believes would take the microbusiness licenses out of the hands of eligible applicants and put them into the hands of well-connected or out-of-state cannabis investors, according to the administrative appeal case documents obtained by The Independent.
Each of those agreements largely led to the state revoking a microbusiness license issued last year for not meeting the constitutional mandate that the licenses be “majority owned and operated” by eligible applicants.  All but one of the license revocations is being appealed to the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission. 
To be eligible for a microbusiness license, applicants must meet certain criteria, including income below certain thresholds, having past marijuana offenses or being a disabled veteran.
Walter’s law firm and the consulting companies who hired the firm to draw up the agreements have vehemently denied the contracts are predatory, arguing the applicants voluntarily signed them.
“Those documents are all transparent, fair, and compliant with Missouri law, including the Department of Health and Senior Services’ rules,” Jamie Moss, spokeswoman for Walter’s law firm, Armstrong Teasdale, said in an email to The Independent.
Walter’s bio boasts being an “influential advisor to the industry” and a member of the committee responsible for drafting the marijuana legalization amendment that created the microbusiness program.
Cannabis regulators concerned about predatory practices in Missouri’s social equity program

Andrew Mullins, executive director of the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, or MoCann, praised Walter’s legal acumen on behalf of the industry, though he didn’t respond to questions about the revoked licenses. 
“Eric Walter is unquestionably one of the top cannabis lawyers in the Midwest,” Mullins said in an email to The Independent, “and MoCannTrade benefits greatly from his expert legal counsel.”
But legal experts who reviewed the contracts for The Independent say the agreements are an attempt to establish front companies and manipulate the system. 
Nimrod Chapel — an attorney, president of the Missouri NAACP and former chairman of the Administrative Hearing Commission — called the agreements “a trick” that results in eligible applicants “receiving little to nothing.”
“This system — because that’s what it is — it’s a system to divest people who are truly or could be truly deserving underneath the constitutional amendment,” Chapel said.
The contracts written by Walter gave applicants two years to pay back loans that can total up to $2 million. If they couldn’t, they’d have to pay a “break-up fee” of up to $2.5 million or give up ownership of the license transfers to the loan holder, according to the state’s response in several of the appeals. 
“Therefore, the business would likely be unable to generate revenue to pay back the loan,” the state argues in one of the legal filing responding to a revocation appeal. “This leaves them no option but to convert the debt into ownership.”
In most cases, the same people involved in the consulting company that hired Armstrong Teasdale to draw up the contract are also involved in lending the money.
For the last two years, The Independent has documented a pattern of well-connected groups and individuals flooding the microbusiness lottery by recruiting people to submit applications and then offering them contracts that limit their profit and control of the business. 
A majority of the revoked licenses followed this pattern. 
Walter’s agreements are nearly identical to a contract The Independent obtained last year circulated by John Payne, who led the campaign to legalize recreational cannabis in 2022. Armstrong Teasdale denied having anything to do with Payne’s agreement.
 The consultants who hired the firm

For 16 of the 22 revoked licenses connected to Walter, the contracts were between the applicants and a consulting firm called Goldengrain Ventures LLC. The contracts were signed by Arizona-based cannabis investor Michael Halow, according to exhibits submitted in the licensees’ appeals. 
Four of the revoked licenses involved the consulting companies MO Microbusiness LLC and W2 Industries, with either David Brodsky or Scott Wootton signing as managers. Brodsky and Wootton are MoCann board members and “micro reps,” in addition to being investors in the industry.  
Two involved the consulting firm Great Granny Gertie LLC, where Springfield-based investor Thane Kifer signed as the company’s manager. 
A person can only be the owner of one microbusiness license.
Information on the cannabis microbusiness program posted by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on its website.
In an email to The Independent, Halow said he’s confident the Administrative Hearing Commission will reverse the revocation decisions.
“The agreements were designed to create a relationship where these businesses can become operational in a highly competitive, capital-starved industry,” he said. “The marijuana microbusiness program was supposed to open doors and provide social equity and promote diversity within the legal cannabis industry.”
Halow said he can’t control how others “subjectively characterize the agreements,” but he is “focused on our clients’ gratitude and satisfaction with the agreements.”
Brodsky said in an emailed statement the licensees he’s involved with “do not feel exploited. They feel abandoned by the state and targeted for simply trying to raise capital to build a thriving business.” 
None of Brodsky’s clients were willing to speak with The Independent because of the pending appeals, he said. 
Wootton and Kifer did not respond to requests for comment.
Walter wrote letters to the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation in November stating that Armstrong Teasdale represented all four of those consultant companies, according to exhibits submitted as part of the appeals process. He argued applicants are allowed to enter into agreements that would transfer ownership in the future.
“Intentions and possibilities are not reality,” Walter states, “and until and unless the company takes any affirmative action that actually violates the rules, no basis for discipline exists.”
The state couldn’t comment on Walter’s argument in his November letter due to active litigation, said Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which houses the division.
“However, generally, the department reviewed many circumstances, specific to each licensee, before concluding a license was not awarded to eligible individuals who owned and operated the microbusiness,” Cox said. 
Last year, state cannabis regulators warned that companies were applying for microbusiness licenses “on behalf of qualified individuals with promises of future ownership in the license” but giving them agreements to sign that stated otherwise. 
“Eligible individuals should exercise caution in accepting such arrangements,” the division stated in a press release last year, “as some of the solicitations may be predatory in nature.” 
 How the social equity program came to be 

In 2022, leaders of the campaign to legalize recreational cannabis faced a major hurdle.
Black business owners were largely excluded from the medical marijuana program when licenses to grow and sell cannabis were doled out by the state in 2019. Many feared history was about to repeat itself despite the fact that Black Missourians were 2.6 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white Missourians. 
So to soothe the concerns and win over skeptics, MoCann’s leaders partnered with Black community leaders and cannabis advocates to come up with the microbusiness license program. 
But of the 105 microbusiness licenses issued so far, 35 have been revoked, including the 22 involving contracts drafted by Walter and Armstrong Teasdale.
 Attorneys who reviewed the contract for The Independent concluded they were unfair and potentially predatory. All four agreed state cannabis regulators should reject any license application connected to the contract because it violates the constitutional mandate requiring licenses to be “majority owned and operated” by the eligible applicant. 
Alleged ‘predatory’ contracts continue to surface in Missouri social-equity marijuana program

Mike Wolff, a former chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court and dean emeritus of the St. Louis University Law School, said the state has a “serious argument” behind its actions.
The cost to apply for a microbusiness license is $1,500, and those applications are entered into a lottery. If picked, a person could come away with a license that’s worth $1 million to $2 million. 
However, in all but two cases, the contract offers to pay the application cost and lend startup money, in exchange for the applicant to walk away with less than 10% of the profits.
The contract requires the eligible applicant to set up an LLC with a three-member board. The applicant has only one vote on the board. And if they ever want to walk away, they are required to pay their consultant a “break-up fee” of up to $2.5 million.
Two years after signing the contract — or around April 2026 — the applicants would have to transfer ownership to the company lending the licensee $1 million or more in startup costs, or pay the break-up fee. Failing to do these steps would be a breach of contract.
“Given the drafted and executed documents, the intent to transfer ownership and operational control to another entity is apparent,” the division stated in a document submitted as part of the appeal. 
There was no indication in any document that an eligible ownership would be maintained, the state said in its filing, or proof of eligibility for “the new owners.”
Halow told The Independent the division is “entitled to its opinion, but it does not reflect the commercial reality or the range of options available to our microbusiness owner clients.” 
Michael Goldberg, managing partner of the Chicago-based firm Goldberg Law Group that specializes in health care, administrative and cannabis law, said the contract “should not get past the state.” 
Joseph von Kaenel, a St. Louis corporate governance attorney, said the state’s reasoning for revoking the licenses is “pretty obvious.” 
“These people are trying to find a disadvantaged person and have them front the deal,” he said. “And the way it’s set up, the disadvantaged people are more likely than not going to be thrown out.”
Von Kaenel worked for Armstrong Teasdale from 1972 until he was required under a firm policy to retire in 2014 after he turned 70. He sued the firm for severance and lost his case. 
Von Kaenel, Wolff and Chapel likened the arrangement to companies “abusing” public contracting dollars meant to empower minority businesses by, as Von Kaenel put it, “finding a woman or minority to front the business.”
But the harshest criticism came from Adolphus Pruitt, president of the St. Louis chapter of the NAACP who served on the committee that helped write the 2022 legalization amendment.
Pruitt compared the contract to “the slave owner giving me some land to work on. It’s their company, they put up the capital, they’re preparing the applications, they’re paying the fees, they’re managing the business. And if at any time me as the slave fails to do something, I owe them.”
 Changing the rules

Armstrong Teasdale didn’t comment on accusations that the contracts are predatory, instead offering a general statement. 
“As lawyers our job is to help our clients attain their business goals within the bounds of the regulatory and legal framework that exists,” Moss said in an email to The Independent. “That is exactly what we did here and what we do every day to assist our clients.” 
However, Walter addressed the accusation in his letter to the division. 
The state regulators’ notice of pending revocation for these licenses, he wrote, reflect their “disapproval” of companies like his clients. 
“But (the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation) knew those relationships existed during the first round of microbusiness license applications,”  he said, “and it took no steps to prohibit such relationships or alter the license application to prevent them.”
Walter pointed to the guidance the division published on April 4, 2024, “specifically acknowledging the existence of such relationships and characterizing them as potentially predatory.”
In his clients’ agreements, the applicants had to say they “reviewed and understood” the guidance, he wrote in his letter.
“Absent any other changes to the rules or guidance regarding microbusiness applicants working with consultants, the licensee was entitled to reasonably conclude that (the division) had no broad policy objection to applicants working with a company like consultant,” the letter states.
Walter also argues that his clients invested significant resources assisting applicants in the spring of 2024, “because it reasonably relied on the absence of any rules amendments or DCR guidance prohibiting its business model.”
Amy Moore, director of the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation, speaks with a microbusiness owner at the National Cannabis Industry Association’s summit in St. Louis in 2024 (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).
In an email last week, Cox said the department couldn’t comment on Walter’s letter specifically due to litigation, but said the state ramped up education about the requirements for microbusiness licenses before applicants applied to the program in spring 2024.
“It is up to the applicant to ensure its specific arrangements, agreements, and partnerships follow the law and the department’s guidance,” Cox said.
Walter sent his letter one month before the division announced new proposed rules for its marijuana microbusiness program designed to address the issue.

Those rules are still not officially in effect, as they wind through the normal promulgation process that could take up to eight months.
Chapel said the problem isn’t that people don’t know the rules. The state has rules about “good faith and fair dealing,” he said, but it does not seem to be honored when “working people” seek entry into the cannabis industry.
“It’s tragic, really, because in those rare cases where the state actually shines a light and finds fraud or predatory practices, the industry doesn’t step up to do better,” he said.
It’s not the first time the state has seen “the forces of industry dividing Missouri,” he said, where the working-class pays the cost while someone else reaps the benefit.
“So here we are again, talking about whether we need a regulation for every single abuse, every single loophole, every single trick,” Chapel said. “Missourians deserve a system that is transparent, accountable, and fair — not one that rewards predatory contracts and strips opportunity away from the very communities this program was supposed to lift up.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eric-Walter-1024x660.jpg,,,2025-10-08 09:56:14.387678

With less than a month until Nov. 4’s special election, billboards, mailers and advertisements in support and opposition of Proposition 50 are reaching a fever pitch. But in California’s 22nd Congressional District — one of the handful of districts that would be most affected if Prop. 50 were to pass — some residents remain unfamiliar with the measure.
As CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller explains, the 22nd District in San Joaquin Valley currently spans parts of Kings, Tulare and Kern counties. Under Prop. 50, it would include the northwest corner of the city of Fresno and smaller towns like Kerman. 
Democrats are eyeing the 22nd as one of the five possible districts to pick up during the 2026 midterms — ousting incumbent U.S. Rep. David Valadao who has represented the region in Congress for 10 of the last 12 years. His challenger, Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains of Bakerfield, is one of the more moderate Democrats in the state Legislature, and was the sole Democrat to vote against the plan to fast-track the special election.
But some locals Maya spoke to haven’t heard much about Prop. 50, and are more concerned with California’s rising cost of living, access to water for their farms and the threat of immigration raids. Others, however, told Maya they see Prop. 50 as a “power grab” that would further limit Republican voters.

Serving a six-year term as sheriff?

A change California made three years ago to one of its election laws has the potential to prolong the term of an embattled county sheriff who is fighting efforts to remove her from office, writes CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
San Mateo County is currently trying to remove its sheriff, Christina Corpus, from her post after a county investigator found she had violated policies on nepotism and conflicting relationships. Voters overwhelmingly approved a measure in April to grant its board of supervisors the authority to remove the county sheriff, and if they are successful, Corpus would be the state’s first county sheriff to be removed from office.
But if they don’t succeed, Corpus, who was elected in 2022, could stay in office and won’t have to face voters again until 2028. Her unusual six-year term is due to a change in California that places sheriff and district attorney elections in the same years as presidential ones. California Democratic legislators pushed the change in an effort to boost voter turnout for county office elections, which Republicans lawmakers opposed.
As for Corpus, San Mateo’s board of supervisors is expected to hold a hearing to review the recommendations of a retired superior court judge, who on Monday found cause to remove Corpus.
