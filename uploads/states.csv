Generally, new mayors and governing boards possess the power to void and renegotiate contractual decisions made by their predecessors. But this rule does not apply to contracts that are time-specified by statute, such as the six-year solid waste collection contract penned by the city last year.
Since the Jackson city council agreed to a $64-million contract with the New Orleans-based, minority-owned Richard’s Disposal in 2024, the city’s garbage contract likely won’t be reopened until at least 2030, after Horhn’s first term ends. 
But the new mayor is expected to take a host of other contracts under review when he takes office on July 1. 
Robert Gibbs, the chair of Horhn’s transition team, said they have obtained lists of hundreds of city contracts and grants to review with an eye toward efficiency and effectiveness but that it’s too early to say which ones could be renegotiated. 
“For instance, when there has been a man shortage problem, (the city of Jackson has) been able to enter into contracts with companies that brought the man power and the know-how,” Gibbs said this week on Mississippi Today’s political podcast The Other Side. “As we’ve looked at those, some of those are working very well, and we may very well continue those. But in other instances, there’s been a loss of employees for whatever reasons, and those departments have to be built back up.” 
Gibbs added the transition team has heard complaints from local contractors who feel the city has been unreceptive to doing business with them. 
An attorney, developer and local contractor himself, Gibbs was involved in the yearslong dispute between outgoing Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the city council over selecting a new garbage vendor, which spanned from 2021 to 2024. Gibbs’ company served as the minority subcontractor for Waste Management, the company that formerly held the contract and was vying for a renewal. 
“You always hear about the dollar circulating in the community seven, eight times, and that’s important for your community to be profitable. But if those dollars go and leave your community, then you lose that seven or eight times effect,” Gibbs said. “And that’s what I’m afraid we’ve done with a couple of contracts in the city of Jackson.”
The pledge to review contracts has been welcomed by some city council members, including Ashby Foote, a representative for Ward 1 who has vocally opposed numerous city agreements in recent years, including the garbage contract. 
“So much of this stuff has been outsourced because we haven’t had the personnel to do stuff that should’ve been done internally,” Foote said. 
In particular, Foote noted that last year he voted with a majority of the city council to pay $700,000 to a local engineering firm for what he described as a one-year “contract to review contracts” in the public works department.
While Horhn will likely have the opportunity to renegotiate that contract early in his first term, he won’t be able to touch the garbage collection agreement without some effort. 
In general, new mayors and governing boards in Mississippi have the power to rescind or modify city agreements, because that is what they’ve been elected to do, said Pieter Teeuwissen, a Hinds County Court Judge. 
But that rule does not apply to certain time-limited obligations that governments can enter, such as the issuing of municipal bonds, the leasing of sixteenth section lands or the collection of solid waste. 
“The general rule is you want to give each successor governing authority as much opportunity as possible to have a say in the business of the city or county,” Teeuwissen said. “But the legislature in its infinite wisdom has decided that certain types of contracts ought to carry a specific time. Someone who is buying $40 or $50 million in government debt doesn’t want to have to worry every four years that they’re gonna get canceled.” 
The rules around time-limited contracts were the subject of a lawsuit that Teeuwissen brought against Hinds County for terminating his contract as board attorney before its one-year period expired. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with him.
In the case of solid waste collection, state statute permits municipalities to sign six-year contracts, with options to extend the contract through four additional one-year periods. 
This could be because garbage collection is considered an essential city service, Teeuwissen theorized, but he noted that almost any contract can be renegotiated if one party is intent on it, even as these laws are poorly understood by many attorneys in Mississippi.
“A good lawyer and a good set of facts can get you out of almost anything,” he said. 
Marcus Wallace, a well-known city subcontractor, ran for mayor in the Democratic primary in part because he was unhappy with Lumumba’s approach to contracting. He said he’s hopeful the incoming administration will prioritize local contractors who can keep the city’s money in Jackson.  
“Let the big companies pave your State Streets and your Northside Drives and Woodrow Wilsons, but when you go into these neighborhoods and these smaller streets – like a Valley Street – allow the smaller companies to do those jobs,” he said.  
“We gotta start peeling back the layers to help businesses grow, and I really think Mayor-elect Hohrn is gonna do that part,” he added.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06162718/Richards-Disposal2.jpg,,,2025-06-26 11:13:04.751473

She outlined her accomplishments and goals in an interview.,"Indiana Comptroller Elise Nieshalla, a Republican, poses after an interview in downtown Indianapolis on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After serving out the rest of another’s term in office, Indiana Comptroller Elise Nieshalla is seeking her own.
“I knew from the beginning that that would be what I would do: fulfill the term and then be ready to run,” she told the Capital Chronicle on Wednesday.
Nieshalla, a Republican, has served as the state’s 58th chief financial officer since late 2023. Former Gov. Eric Holcomb appointed her after predecessor Tera Klutz resigned.
“It is an absolute privilege to serve as state comptroller in a great state like Indiana, that has its fiscal house in order,” Nieshalla said. “And it would be a privilege to continue serving, to do our part in our office: to provide the accounting and the reporting, the distribution of the tax revenues to the local units, the payroll, the payment of the state’s bills.”
Achievements made — and envisioned
Nieshalla said she’s proudest of her efforts to divest from China and entities that follow environmental, social and governance investment principles.
State officials celebrate as public pension system completes Chinese divestment 

The Indiana Public Retirement System finished shedding its $1.2 billion worth of investments in Chinese entities last August — four years ahead of the schedule state lawmakers set and one year after starting the effort.
Nieshalla, as comptroller, is on the system’s board. But she also chairs the board for a pension supplement called the Deferred Compensation Plan, or Hoosier START. That plan wasn’t required to divest — but did.
“We leaned into it as a board and took the spirit of that law and made certain that the funds invested through the Deferred Compensation Plan were also not invested in anything touching Chinese entities,” she said. “And we also accomplished that here, just in this last year. Very proud of that, for the sake of Hoosiers and the beneficiaries that we serve.”
The boards for INPRS and the Deferred Compensation Plan have taken similar actions following another state ban on ESG in pension investments.
Nieshalla has additionally urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate delisting China-based companies on U.S. stock exchanges.
Another achievement she highlighted is coming this fall.
The comptroller’s office is responsible for the Indiana Transparency Portal, and is working on adding visibility into how the state spends federal funds.

Nieshalla also noted that the office has earned a certificate of achievement for excellence in financial reporting from the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada for 31 years straight — and vowed to continue that for another four years if reelected.
She’s got goals for a prospective next term.
Such as: incorporating artificial intelligence into accounts payable, U.S. Department of Government Efficiency-style.
“We can do that here at the state, look through our massive amounts of information and help our people see even more clearly where there are anomalies that need to be investigated,” Nieshalla said.
Another aim is fund number consolidation.
“Currently, the State Board of Accounts has one number for each fund that local units use. The Department of Local Government Finance has another number, and then local units have yet another,” Nieshalla said.
“It is confusing, it is laborious, it is difficult for the sake of transparency, for Hoosiers to understand,” she added, later. “… It is low-hanging fruit for us as a state to consolidate these numbers in partnership with the local units, to streamline that great working relationship that we have in the distribution of funds and to serve them in their budgeting process.”
Extracurricular and past pursuits
When asked if there was anything else she wanted Hoosiers to know about her, Nieshalla offered up her work with the State Financial Officers Foundation. She pitched and now leads a National Debt Crisis Task Force for the conservative organization.
“I’m very concerned about the rapidly dissolving financial position of our country,” Nieshalla said. “We are under the weight of $36 trillion of debt, and the interest payment alone on that debt is the fastest-growing line item in the federal budget.”
Her task force issued a letter late to then-President-elect Donald Trump and the 535 voting members of Congress last year, urging them to take action.

“It made a great impact. And we’re not done,” Nieshalla said. “We’re working on a follow-up letter in partnership with state legislators, and leaning into providing our support to President Trump and Congress to restore the country’s fiscal solvency — for the country and for the states.”
Prior to her appointment as comptroller, Nieshalla was serving as president of the Boone County Council, president of the Indiana County Councils Association and chair of the Association of Indiana Counties’ 2023 Legislative Committee. She has also worked 22 years in real estate.
Nieshalla made an unsuccessful bid for Indiana treasurer at the 2022 GOP convention but lost out to current officeholder Daniel Elliott.
She earned a bachelor’s degree from Oral Roberts University and a master’s degree from Indiana University. She and her husband, Chris, live in Zionsville, where they’ve raised their four children.

(Photo: Lithium Americas Presentation, June)Cattle rancher Edward Bartell waited patiently to take pictures of Lithium Nevada pumping water from a well the mining company had recently lost the right to use.
“I needed to make sure I caught them pumping and had photographs of them pumping, so I could prove that they were illegally using water,” said Bartell, who holds senior water rights in Thacker Pass.
His photos confirmed what the Nevada Division of Water Resources already suspected during an earlier field investigation. Lithium Nevada was, without a permit and despite a court order to halt, still pumping water from a contested well.
The state sent the mining company a cease and desist order Friday. 
The Nevada Division of Water Resources, which manages public waters in the state, said Lithium Nevada continued using the well despite being notified in April that their water permits were no longer valid.
Lithium Nevada’s water permits were reversed after Nevada’s Sixth Judicial District Court found the state agency erred when they approved two water permits for mining operations in Thacker Pass without properly analyzing whether the action would conflict with Bartell’s senior water rights.
Lithium Nevada was given 14 days to comply with the cease and desist. Bartell said he’s standing watch to ensure they do.
“It’s very frustrating for a family business to try and keep operating our business when the huge mining company comes in and continues to trample our rights and adversely affect the springs and the ecosystem out there,” he said.
He added, “They’re the neighbor from hell.”
Lithium Americas CEO and President Jonathan Evans in a statement to Current said the company would “continue to follow all laws and guidance from our federal and state partners, and are optimistic we will come to a positive resolution with the state.”
Water watchdog group Great Basin Resource Watch said the reversal of previously granted water permits by the Nevada Division of Water Resource was an example of “sloppy permitting” for a project that was approved unusually quickly.
President Donald Trump approved the Thacker Pass lithium mine project in Nevada five days before his first term ended. It was one of several projects fast-tracked by his administration to advance energy and mining development on public land.
“I’ve never seen a cease and desist order from the state on water rights,” said John Hadder, director of Great Basin Resource Watch. “It doesn’t make sense to try to ignore the law.”
“That’s the rush we’re seeing with a lot of this lithium mining. Just push it through. But there’s consequences if you don’t do it right,” he continued.
Lithium Nevada said it’s looking at several options to cover its immediate water needs as construction continues, but that the company is confident further analysis will restore their previous water permits.
“We are excited to be moving forward with construction on the Thacker Pass lithium project to deliver a U.S.-produced lithium supply chain that reduces American dependence on foreign suppliers for critical minerals,” Evans said in a statement.
Lawsuits and delays have plagued the construction of the planned lithium mine in Nevada for years. Lithium Americas had initially planned to begin lithium production at Thacker Pass by 2026, but several permitting issues and litigation by Nevada tribes and conservation groups helped delay the project. Lithium production at Thacker Pass is now expected to run at full capacity in 2028.
Bartell has been fighting the approval of several water permits awarded to Lithium Nevada for the construction and operation of a massive lithium mine near the Nevada-Oregon border, arguing the mine would deplete the available water for his ranch.
Since 2008, Bartell has used his senior water rights to rear cow calves at his ranch before selling them to buyers across the nation. He fears the water he depends on will soon be drained to extract millions of tons of lithium from clay at Thacker Pass.
“We’ve definitely seen a diminishment of one of the springs. It’s definitely flowing a lot less water than it was,” said Bartell.
Before their permit was revoked, Lithium Nevada was using water from the contested well for construction work. Once the lithium mine is in operation, however, that water would be used to create a slurry out of lithium-infused clay the targeted lithium can be separated from through a complex evaporation process.
While lithium mining is water intensive, Lithium Nevada has repeatedly said their environmental assessment proves Bartell’s ranch will not be negatively affected by their operation.
Bartell was sceptical, arguing “the evidence is very clear that they will dry up our springs, but obviously they will spend enormous sums of money to try and argue otherwise.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image-5-8-24-at-4.10-PM-1024x600.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 11:13:04.751473

(CHFS photo)Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball has asked the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) to share information about “a significant number” of denials under Medicaid’s Home and Community Based Waiver (HCBW).
Ball sent a letter to the cabinet asking for more information on Tuesday, saying “these denials have raised serious concerns” about waiver eligibility “as well as the broader implications for vulnerable individuals who depend on these critical services.” 
A CHFS spokesperson said the cabinet learned earlier this year of an increase in denials and said a subcontractor wasn’t “correctly examining the Medicaid criteria used to determine if someone requires long-term care services.” 
The cabinet then “required the subcontractor to take action and correct their error,” it says. 
A spokeswoman for Ball said the Ombudsman’s Office, which investigates and resolves complaints about agencies in CHFS, including protective services for children and elderly Kentuckians, received 47 waiver denial appeals since January. 
Joy Pidgorodetska Markland, the communications director for the auditor, said information from the cabinet will help the office to “have a better idea of how to reach families and get a deeper sense of exactly how widespread this problem is.” 
“We were made aware that despite some children having more severe health conditions than when they originally were approved for the waiver, they were nonetheless denied,” Markland said. “It appears that all families received a boilerplate letter with the same language and general reason for denial without any specifics about the child. But beyond that written correspondence, we do not yet know what exactly families have been told about this entire situation.” 
A cabinet spokeswoman said that as of Wednesday, after addressing the subcontractor error, it had “corrected” 112 cases involving children and 67 involving adults. 
“Team Kentucky believes that health care is a basic human right and works to ensure everyone has access to quality care,” Beth Fisher, the deputy executive director in the cabinet’s Office of Public Affairs, said in an email. “We have been transparent with both the public and families about an issue with a subcontractor that has since been resolved.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/agencies-2.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 11:13:04.751473

(Photo by Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)Medicaid patients do not have the right to sue to visit the doctor of their choice, allowing states like South Carolina to remove clinics that also provide abortions from their lists of providers, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to Thursday’s opinion began with a 2018 executive order, in which Gov. Henry McMaster directed the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from the list of medical providers that patients can choose to visit for non-abortion health care services.
Six justices agreed with the decision. One wrote a separate concurring opinion. Three dissented.
Planned Parenthood, which operates two clinics in the state, sued, claiming a patient has the right to visit the clinics for other services, such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Medicaid already excludes most abortions, covering them only in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life under a federal provision South Carolina follows.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state Department of Health and Human Services.
A federal appeals court ruled against McMaster’s order three times, deciding the state can’t deny Medicaid patients from going to the provider of their choice because the provider also offers abortions.
Each time, the state’s attorneys appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to take up the issue until December.

The Senate won’t convict a president who has committed high crimes. The Supreme Court will give an insurrectionist president a free pass and grant him king-like immunity. The criminal justice system fails to impose any accountability against a politically powerful felon.
Coloradans can count the governor’s office as yet another institution that won’t save them from the Trump administration’s cruelty and lawlessness. As became clear this week in testimony before a Denver District Court judge, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, at least on some crucial matters, is on team MAGA.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in April sent an administrative subpoena to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment seeking personal information that could improperly expose dozens of residents to immigration enforcement. Colorado has laws that prohibit state personnel from sharing personal identifying information with federal immigration officers except in response to a court-issued subpoena or to assist with a federal criminal investigation.
Polis had ordered that the information be released to ICE, claiming that disclosure was justified under the state law’s criminal-investigation exception. 
A top CDLE manager, Scott Moss, brought a whistleblower lawsuit against Polis to stop what he said would be illegal disclosures. A judge on Wednesday sided with Moss.
A witness on Polis’ side seemed to substantiate Moss’ case during testimony. CDLE director Joe Barela acknowledged under questioning in court that he knew of no evidence that the information sought in the subpoena had anything to do with a criminal investigation. And when Polis lawyer Thomas Rogers III continued to insist that the subpoena was related to a criminal investigation, even Judge A. Bruce Jones had had enough. 
“Am I going to believe you or my own lying eyes?” he said.
The judge’s eyes could see the subpoena itself. It was titled “Immigration Enforcement Subpoena.” It was an administrative document and did not come from a court. It sought extensive personal information, including work and medical records, of 35 people identified as sponsors of unaccompanied child immigrants. 
The only mention in the subpoena of a crime was so open-ended as to be meaningless. It said that Homeland Security Investigations, an agency within ICE, was “conducting investigative activities” to locate unaccompanied immigrant children to ensure they’re not the victims of “crimes,” such as human trafficking.
That’s not a criminal investigation. Not in the legal sense. Not according to common sense. That’s a fishing expedition.
But Polis is on board with it.
No pursuit of the Trump administration so exemplifies its lawlessness and cruelty so much as its immigration enforcement program, which has terrorized communities, stripped residents of due process rights, disappeared people to a brutal foreign prison, targeted individuals who have done nothing more than express a disfavored opinion, and resulted in the arrest of elected officials.
Leaders of Trump’s mass deportation effort originally claimed that it would target violent criminals, but its implementation shows that anyone without residency authorization is at risk, no matter how long they’ve lived in America, no matter how clean their record, no matter how much they’ve contributed to their communities. This week a whistleblower revealed that it was federal Justice Department policy to ignore court orders and withhold information in immigration enforcement cases.
In other words, immigration officials have repeatedly acted in bad faith, yet Polis has chosen to give them the benefit of the doubt. This has come at great cost to Coloradans — not just the countless families in the state who might fear that masked government goons at any time could kidnap one of their own off the street, but also the tens of thousands of residents who grieve the erosion of constitutional order and have registered their fear and anger by marching in multiple protests against ICE’s unaccountable behavior.
As Trump’s return to the presidency approached, many Coloradans took some comfort in assuming that leaders like Polis, a Democrat leading a blue state, might provide some protection against the fascist abuses they suspected, correctly, would issue from Washington. But early on there were ominous indications that Polis was aligned with MAGA, not least the president’s immigration enforcement program. Now it’s clear Polis has made the governor’s office an extension of that program.
Institutions won’t save us. When individual Coloradans take to the streets to demonstrate in opposition to Trump’s authoritarian outrages, they would be justified in including the Colorado governor’s office as an object of protest.

However, […]","Skiers ride the Mayday lift near the top of Bald Mountain, the highest point at Sun Valley Ski Resort in Idaho. (Getty Images)The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously overturned a controversial earlier decision that had sent alarm through the ski industry in Idaho and nationwide, holding instead that a lower court was right to dismiss a lawsuit from the widow of a skier who died after crashing into a snowmaking tower gun at Sun Valley.
However, the court, with just one justice dissenting, upheld its earlier ruling that departed from decades of precedent in Idaho in how the state’s Ski Area Liability Law should be interpreted with regard to the legal “standard of care.” That potentially opens the door to far more lawsuits over ski injuries in Idaho, rather than reducing ski area liability, as lawmakers who originally sponsored the 1979 law said they intended.
Justice Cynthia Meyer, in her dissent, wrote that the law is clear as written. “Whether it is wise or socially unsound is not for us to decide. But that is the framework the legislature enacted,” she wrote. She added, quoting an earlier Idaho Supreme Court case, “The wisdom, justice, policy, or expediency of a statute are questions for the legislature alone.”
Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, an attorney and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, declined to take up a 2024 bill from Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, to amend the law after the initial decision, saying he preferred to wait until the court’s processes were completed.
“Let the judiciary make the decision, and then we act as necessary, if the law should be changed,” he said in February.
On Wednesday, he told the Idaho Capital Sun, “Now’s the time for our committee to at least look at possible changes, so that the law is more clear, as to what it is intended —  so that it’s easier for the courts and litigants to interpret.”
Idaho’s 2025 legislative session adjourned on April 4; unless they hold a special session, lawmakers are next set to convene in January of 2026.
“Obviously we’re pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold summary judgment,” said Brad Wilson, general manager of Bogus Basin and former president of the Idaho Ski Areas Association. “ … We won this particular piece of it, and so we’re pleased with that. But I don’t know what the implications of the rest of it is.”
Wilson said he planned to meet with attorneys to further evaluate the new ruling.
 Milus v. Sun Valley Co. case stems from 2019 skiing accident

Justice Colleen Zahn, the author of the original 2023 decision, wrote Wednesday’s decision, and stuck with her earlier decision on several key points about the interpretation of the law. But she reversed course on a major issue: Whether the section in the law that places all risk for collisions with clearly visible, marked snowmaking equipment on the skier barred the lawsuit in the first place. The skier was the late Dr. Stewart Milus of Boise.
“We hold that Milus’ claims are barred because the record establishes that Snow Gun 16 was plainly marked,” Zahn wrote, “… and that Mr. Milus assumed the risk of injury caused by that equipment.”
The case, Milus v. Sun Valley Co., involves a November 2019 accident in which Milus hit a bright yellow-padded tower snow gun in the middle of Lower River Run at the resort in 2019, and died from his injuries. His widow, Laura Milus, sued the ski resort for wrongful death.
According to court records, Milus was skiing with “poor control” on the moderately crowded groomed run on that clear Saturday afternoon. He skied across the backs of another skier’s skis and yelled, then fell and crashed head-first into the tower, one of a row of such towers that stretches down the run.
The district court dismissed the lawsuit on summary judgment, based on Idaho’s 1979 Ski Area Liability Act. The widow appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court, which in December of 2023 overturned the lower court’s decision, offered an entirely new interpretation of the decades-old law, and said a jury should weigh whether the ski area was at least partially to blame, regardless of the skier’s actions.
Sun Valley Resort sought reconsideration of the court’s decision, which the justices granted, hearing additional arguments from both sides in February.
 Idaho Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling could force some ski areas out of business, operators say

The December 2023 decision from Idaho’s highest court caused great consternation for Idaho’s 19 ski areas, which range from giant Sun Valley to tiny, one-chairlift mom-and-pop ski hills. If the state law doesn’t afford the resorts the liability protections it’s long been thought to provide, they said they expect to see a big increase in lawsuits, along with sharply increasing liability insurance costs. That could drive up the cost of skiing statewide, and force small resorts out of business if they can’t afford the increased costs.
That’s what happened in Vermont, after an infamous Vermont Supreme Court decision in 1978. That ruling, Sunday v. Stratton Corp., prompted most of the 37 U.S. states that have ski areas to pass ski area liability laws, many of them similar to Idaho’s. Idaho’s law has repeatedly been upheld in court since it first passed in 1979; state lawmakers affirmed their intent when they last approved amendments to the law in 2014.
Idaho’s law says skiers take on the liability for the inherent risks of the sport, including colliding with trees, bare spots, lift towers, clearly visible snowmaking or snowgrooming equipment and the like. It holds ski areas liable for operation of lifts, including maintaining them to national standards, along with a list of nine specific duties such as clearly marking the level of difficulty for designated trails.
Skiers are liable if they don’t comply with their own enumerated duties, including skiing in control and within their ability, heeding all posted warnings, and sticking to designated runs.
Idaho’s law says ski areas can’t be held to “any standard of care” for actions designed to lessen the inherent risks of skiing, meaning they can’t be sued for how well they accomplish them. A long line of decisions from the Idaho Supreme Court and federal courts has held that that applies to all nine of the enumerated duties of ski areas.
There were three points on which the high court’s initial 2023 ruling appeared to depart from the long line of precedent in Idaho, and from the lower court’s ruling:

It applied an “ordinarily prudent person standard of care” for judging how well ski areas carry out their nine enumerated duties under the law, rather than concluding that the law eliminated any standard of care for those duties. That’s the standard that would be applied if there were no ski area liability law.
It ruled that it should be up to a jury to decide how well Sun Valley carried out two of those duties, regarding what constitutes a “warning implement” on snowmaking equipment and whether the resort had adequately posted notice that snowmaking was “in progress” when snowmaking equipment was in place, but no snow was being made. The justices on Wednesday found Milus hadn’t provided sufficient evidence the ski area failed to meet its duties on those points.
It held that the skier’s compliance with his own enumerated duties, including controlling speed and course and heeding all posted warnings, can’t be considered until a jury decides if the resort was negligent with regard to warning implements and signs — and can’t be considered at all if the jury finds the resort failed on those points. That’s the key point that was overturned, leading to dismissal of the lawsuit.

Laura Milus attended the arguments before the court on Feb. 14, as did the general managers of three Idaho ski areas and a host of others.
Milus said after the February arguments that she thought it was “reckless” for Sun Valley to have snow guns “right in the middle of a beginner run, where somebody is going to go out of control.” She also said then that even if she didn’t win, she hoped the case would bring attention to that issue.
In response to the court’s December 2023 decision, in February of 2024, at the urging of the ski industry, Ehardt introduced House Bill 516, adding a clear statement to the existing law that “no standard of care” applies to the enumerated duties of ski areas.
That would put the interpretation of Idaho’s law back to where it has been since the law was first enacted, before the court’s December 2023 ruling. The bill never got a hearing.

Gov. JB Pritzker will run for a third term as governor. He’s officially making the reelection announcement Thursday in a four-stop tour that spans Chicago, Rockford, Peoria and Springfield.

Should Pritzker win and serve a full term, he would become the only three-term Democratic governor in Illinois’ history.

“I’m running for re-election to protect our progress and continue solving the problems we face,” he said in an announcement video. “I love this state, and it’s the honor of my life to serve as your governor – to help lead through the most challenging of times and celebrate the most joyful ones together. I’m ready for the fight ahead.”

Pritzker has not yet announced a running mate to replace Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, who is running for U.S. Senate in 2026.

The state GOP issued a statement saying Pritzker should be “fired not re-hired.”

“He’s prioritized illegal immigrants over Illinois families, hiked taxes, and rammed through the largest, most bloated budget in state history,” ILGOP Chairman Kathy Salvi said in a statement.

The governor’s political future has been the topic of significant speculation, especially since he was shortlisted for former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate search last summer in her campaign for the White House. That and his vocal and frequent condemnations of President Donald Trump have fueled speculation of a presidential run in 2028.

The announcement that he will run for governor does not prohibit a future presidential run, because governor and president are not up in the same election cycle.

Several Republicans have announced plans to run for governor. DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick said he would run earlier this year. Mechanic and Posen Park District Commissioner Phil Perez and businessman Joe Severino have also publicly said they are running, while Cook County GOP Chair Aaron Del Mar is also mulling a run.

Capitol News Illinois will cover the Chicago and Springfield events and have full coverage later today.

In this photo, a man holds wood chips. (File photo by Getty Images)A lumber company plans to make rural Allendale County home to its first East Coast sawmill, employing 125 South Carolinians.
Oregon-headquartered Hampton Lumber announced it will build the new $225 million mill near the town of Fairfax. The 375,000-square-foot mill is expected to make framing lumber used in home construction, with production scheduled to begin in 2027.
“This investment will benefit not only our state’s timber farmers but will also offer quality jobs in a largely rural and agricultural part of the state,” state Commissioner of Agriculture Hugh Weathers said in a statement.
And State Forester Scott Phillips called the mill a “welcome boost to the industry and to communities that rely on forestry for economic opportunity.”
The mill is expected to buy southern yellow pine common in South Carolina, a potential shot in the arm to a state timber industry that has been struggling amid closures of major paper mills.
“We’re happy to join the healthy wood products industry already present in the region, and we look forward to building partnerships in the area and supporting the communities in and around Allendale County,” Hampton Lumber CEO Randy Schillinger said in a statement.
It’s also a boost for Allendale County, among the state’s poorest counties with historically high jobless rates. The county’s 4.8% unemployment rate last month ranked 10th highest, according to the state Department of Employment and Workforce.
SouthernCarolina Alliance President Danny Black, the head of the region’s economic development agency, said Allendale County Council is considering a deal that would lower Hampton Lumber’s property taxes to a 4% rate for 40 years in exchange for the company’s investment.
By state law, manufacturers without such an arrangement pay a 6% rate. (Industrial property owners previously paid a 10.5% rate, but state laws passed in 2017 and 2022 effectively lowered it to 6%.)
The state also approved the company for income tax credits worth $25,000 per new job annually.
“Hampton Lumber’s new operation in Allendale County will be a notable addition to our state’s forestry industry, while also providing opportunities for our people and contributing to the local economy,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Senate is working on the “big, beautiful bill” — a massive tax package that gives money directly to the wealthiest Americans while gutting programs that help everyday South Dakotans. If passed, this bill would cause devastating harm through deep cuts to Medicaid, higher health care costs for those enrolled in the Affordable Care Act, and automatic cuts to Medicare.
This bill will increase the federal deficit, resulting in the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act (PAYGO) to kick in. That law requires automatic, across-the-board cuts to programs like Medicare unless Congress intervenes. So not only does this bill extend $1.1 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, it pulls the rug out from under those who rely on Medicare just to get by.
The human cost of this legislation is staggering.
As someone who works directly with people experiencing homelessness, I witness every day what a lack of health care looks like. It’s the untreated infections that escalate into emergencies. It’s the missed mental health support that results in a crisis. It’s the addiction that goes unaddressed because there are no accessible recovery services. It’s the quiet suffering of people who are told — explicitly or implicitly — that their lives are expendable in the name of tax cuts for the rich.
Thune, other GOP leaders in US Senate struggle to lessen pain of Medicaid cuts for rural hospitals

And as a pediatrician, I’ve seen firsthand how children suffer when the health care safety net is dismantled. I’ve seen children arrive at shelters sick, scared, and in need of urgent care that their families simply couldn’t afford. Medicaid covers nearly half of all births in South Dakota and provides essential services like immunizations, developmental screenings, and early interventions that can change the course of a child’s life. Without it, preventable illnesses go untreated, mental health conditions worsen, and families are left with nowhere to turn. Children don’t get a second chance at healthy development. We must protect their access to care now.
Children, people with disabilities, older adults, and rural communities will bear the brunt of this proposal. Medicaid is not just a safety net; it is a lifeline. In South Dakota, Medicaid expansion has helped thousands access preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health services — often for the first time in their lives. This bill would unravel that progress.
It’s not just individuals who will suffer. This legislation threatens the very institutions that keep our communities alive — hospitals, senior-living centers, and nursing homes. Many of these facilities operate on razor-thin margins and rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement to stay open. If this bill passes, South Dakota will see closures, especially in rural areas where there is no backup option. When the local hospital closes, people die. When a senior center shuts its doors, families are left scrambling to care for aging loved ones without support.
And for what? To fund permanent tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy. That’s not fiscal responsibility. That’s cruelty disguised as budgeting.
There is still time to act. Congress can let the Trump-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire. Congress can still extend the tax cuts for the hardworking middle and low-income earners. These two things are not mutually exclusive.
Instead of the federal government forcing states like South Dakota to shoulder more health care costs, citizens should have access to the critical programs that keep them healthy — especially our children, whose futures depend on it.

(Photo by Allen Stegeman/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Alaska, like other states around the nation, is compiling a 10-year plan to guide conservation of sometimes vulnerable wildlife populations. Alaska’s State Wildlife Action Plan, which is in draft form, identifies “species of greatest conservation need” because of declining populations, changing habitat, development, invasive species threats, knowledge gaps or other concerns.
But now the federal funding that supports Alaska’s State Wildlife Action Plan and those of other states is itself vulnerable.
The Trump administration proposes to zero out funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s entire State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program, established in 2000. The program distributes money to states to use on conservation projects that are designed in accordance with wildlife action plans. For Alaska, the most recent grant funding was about $2.76 million.
In its Fish and Wildlife Service budget summary, the Trump administration pitched elimination of the grant funding as part of a shift to the private sector.
“Although FWS is responsible for conserving trust resources across broad landscapes, its work to conserve natural resources is impossible without partnerships with States, Tribes, and private landowners. In recognition of this, the 2026 Budget will eliminate grants to States and Tribes that come with strings attached on the types of species they should conserve. These eliminations will be complemented by FWS investments in partnerships with private landowners,” the summary said.
The summary does not identify the “strings” that the administration contends limit states’ actions.
While Alaska and other states must have 10-year wildlife action plans to qualify for the federal grants, the states choose how those grants will be distributed, said an official with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s Division of Wildlife Conservation.
State Wildlife Grants “are implemented at the discretion of the states,” said Lindsey Nietmann in an email. She is the coordinator of the division’s threatened, endangered and diversity program.
A key goal of the plan in Alaska and those in other states is to address possible wildlife problems before they get serious enough to warrant the drastic step of Endangered Species Act listing, said state biologist Julie Hagelin.
“An important general principle is that it’s more cost effective to maintain or manage or mitigate threats to ensure sustainable populations of wildlife, sort of in a proactive way, rather than the need to go to great lengths and expense and sort of have prescriptive regulatory burdens that the federal government imposes through the ESA,” said Hagelin, a conservation and management coordinator with the Division of Wildlife Conservation.
The concept fits Alaska’s constitutional mandate for sustained yield and is “consistent with this idea of being proactive and caring for the long-term sustainability of our natural and wildlife,” Hagelin said.

	A variety of work to mitigate threats has been funded by the federal grants. Recent projects include research into Alaska bats and the dangers they may be facing from white-nosed syndrome, a fungal disease that has killed large numbers of Lower 48 bats; monitoring of the Aleutian tern, a migratory bird that breeds only in coastal Alaska and neighboring parts of Siberia and is believed to be declining in population; and studies of forest practices that are best for regeneration and protection of habitat used by bird and mammal species.
The State Wildlife Grant Program appears to be popular nationally.
“This program provides critical funding to every U.S. state and territory to plan and implement proactive conservation actions to prevent the nation’s fish and wildlife from becoming endangered,” the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department says on its website. “The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program is considered the core program for keeping species healthy and off the federal threatened and endangered species list, a goal shared by a broad constituency of conservationists, business, farmers, ranchers, and land developers.”
“The State Wildlife Grants program has allowed the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and its partners to accomplish so much more for Iowa’s Natural Resources than was possible before its inception,” the Iowa Department of Natural Resources website says. “State Wildlife Grants is the nation’s most important program in keeping species from becoming endangered.”
“State Wildlife Grants save taxpayers millions of dollars,” the Georgia Department of Natural Resources website says. “Taking action to conserve wildlife before it becomes endangered is environmentally sound and fiscally responsible. Once a species drops to the point of potential extinction, recovery efforts become risky and expensive. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”
Even the first Trump administration lauded the program. In 2020, the final year of the first Trump administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service released a publication that touted it as providing “20 years of conservation success.”
However, the first Trump administration attempted that year to slash funding for the program by more than $20 million, though not eliminate it. Congress wound up appropriating about the same amount in that budget as had been appropriated in other recent years.
The wildlife grants continue to enjoy bipartisan support in Congress, if a recent letter signed by 42 U.S. senators is any indication.
Alaska bats, belugas, hares among the project subjects
The federal grant program distributed about $55 million in total to states to be used at their discretion for work this year. Alaska, California and Texas received equal amounts and were the top recipients. That has been the case every year since 2002, with annual amounts that ranged from about $2.3 million to over $3.8 million.
Related Fish and Wildlife Service grants are awarded to tribal governments across the nation. That tribal grant program distributed about $6 million for projects this year. In Alaska, tribal governments have used grants from that program for projects that include fish surveys in Southeast Alaska to clam restoration work in Prince William Sound to habitat surveys in Seward Peninsula areas that might be affected by mine development.
Another related program provides grants on a competitive basis totaling about $7 million a year. One recent Alaska project that won a competitive grant concerned research into the endangered Cook Inlet beluga whale population.
If the grants survive, a wide range of Alaska species could benefit.

	Alaska’s new wildlife action plan, in draft form, identifies 362 vertebrates as being of “greatest conservation need,” a number that includes 188 bird species, 101 fish species, 43 terrestrial mammals, 25 marine mammals and five amphibians. That is far fewer than the approximately 20 Alaska populations with Endangered Species Act protection.
One species identified as being of greatest conservation need is the Alaska hare, sometimes called the tundra hare. It is known for its large size – up to 15 pounds, much larger than the more abundant snowshoe hare – but a lot of other details about the population remain unknown.
There are historical accounts from biologists and local hunters who described seeing groups of hundreds of Alaska hares, Hagelin said. “And now it’s pretty rare to find groups of more than three to four individuals,” she said. Aside from those indicators of decline, wildlife managers are faced with a scarcity of information about Alaska hares in general, including their population status and habitat use, she said. “It’s all kind of poorly understood.”
Recent research that was funded in part by the federal grant program enabled biologists to engage in some “epic snowmachine surveys” in which they gathered hare pellets and tagged some animals to piece together genetic and population information, Hagelin said. Information from that work helped lead to some hunting restrictions imposed by the state Board of Game and Federal Subsistence Board, she said.
Another species identified as being among those of “greatest conservation need” is the gray-headed chickadee, previously known as the Siberian tit. Their range extends across the circumpolar north, from Siberia to northern Asia to North America, but the Alaska population appears to have declined.
For the most part, the list of species in the draft 2025 State Wildlife Action Plan is the same as that in the 2015 plan. There are 37 more identified in the new plan, largely because of habitat changes that have affected aquatic species.
An important new element is a more precise methodology for selecting species of greatest conservation need, Hagelin said. That uses a ranking system developed by the Alaska Center for Conservation Science at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
In addition to guiding federally funded projects, the State Wildlife Action Plan helps Alaska coordinate management actions with other states, Hagelin said. That is important to protecting migratory birds that spend the summer breeding seasons in the Arctic or subarctic, where habitats are more likely to be intact, but spend other parts of the year in southern habitats that may be more compromised, she said.
Generally, the plan does not apply to game species that are widely hunted, such as caribou, because there are numerous other programs and revenue sources that provide money used for management and conservation, she said.
Likewise, it does not concentrate much on fish that are the subject of big commercial or sport harvests, as those fisheries have their own management and funding systems. And it does not include plants, though other states’ plans do extend to plant species. Texas is among the states that includes plants in its wildlife action plan, and it has a total of about 1,200 identified species of greatest conservation need, Hagelin said.
The State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program is among several Fish and Wildlife Service-managed programs that the Trump administration has targeted for funding elimination.
The administration’s budget proposes no money for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund, the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund, the Multinational Species Conservation Fund and the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. Each of those funds got between $5 million and $49 million in funding for the current fiscal year.

DPH Commissioner Robbie Goldstein urged his advisors to stay open-minded while also hinting at the possibility of disentangling state policy from the Trump administration.
The post State experts mulling federal vaccine policy shifts, Mass. response appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS TURMOIL engulfed a federal vaccine advisory panel earlier this month, Massachusetts Department of Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein urged his own set of advisors to stay open-minded while also hinting at the possibility of disentangling state policy from the Trump administration.
That philosophy could be tested later Wednesday and Thursday, as the CDC’s revamped Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meets and reviews a vaccine ingredient that US Health and Human Health Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. has previously — and, experts say, erroneously — linked to conditions like autism. Kennedy fired all 17 ACIP members on June 9 and made eight new appointments days later.
The Massachusetts Vaccine Purchasing Advisory Council (MVPAC) orients its work closely around guidance from the ACIP. At its recent meeting, Goldstein acknowledged the upheaval at the federal panel has been “in some ways, very alarming.”
“I guess I want to say to this group that’s here that I think it is our responsibility to keep an open mind about what is happening, to analyze the data as they’re presented to ACIP, to think like an ACIP member in the next two weeks, and to use this body to have our own deliberation and our own discussion,” Goldstein said on June 12. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to jump to conclusions that what ACIP decides at the end of June is necessarily wrong or necessarily right. I think it’s our responsibility to look at the data that are presented, to listen to the deliberation, and to come to our own conclusions — and they may be the same.”
Kennedy said he chose to do a “clean sweep” and reconstitute the panel “to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science.” The secretary later wrote on social media that his new appointees include “highly credentialed scientists, leading public-health experts, and some of America’s most accomplished physicians.”
Goldstein pointed out one of those new members is Dr. H. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, who also happens to be on the MVPAC.
“I think Dr. Meissner has shown a commitment to the science, a commitment to evidence, a commitment to vaccine policies that protect the commonwealth, protect people across this country,” Goldstein said. “And so I’m hopeful that there are more like him on the advisory committee as it is repopulated.”
One of the dismissed ACIP members was Dr. Lin Chen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in a letter to Kennedy on Tuesday, said the panel’s new members “include vaccine skeptics, medical professionals with conflicts of interest, and individuals without any apparent experience conducting studies of vaccines, counseling patients about vaccines, or administering vaccines.”
“As presently constituted, the committee lacks the qualifications and credibility to offer the nation credible advice on vaccines,” Warren wrote.
The ACIP’s role is to make recommendations about vaccine safety, efficacy and clinical need to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to HHS.
Meanwhile, the MVPAC’s mission is to help DPH distribute ACIP-recommended childhood vaccines “to ensure the health and safety of the Commonwealth’s citizens.” Some members are designated by DPH, the Center for Health Information and Analysis, the Massachusetts Academy of Pediatrics, the Massachusetts Medical Society and health insurers.
The MVPAC makes its purchasing recommendations using principles such as safety and efficacy, cost and supply issues, provider and patient issues, and market share, according to the body’s guiding principles. Aiming to “maximize vaccine coverage and minimize provider confusion, vaccine waste and administration errors,” the MVPAC says it also “will avoid to the degree possible making significant changes to their periodic purchasing recommendations except as indicated by their careful assessment of the factors outlined in these principles.”
Before coming to DPH, Goldstein worked as a senior policy advisor at the CDC during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Goldstein said state public health officials have been working to gauge how Massachusetts fits into the “complicated federal landscape,” including within the legal and regulatory arena.
“So what laws, what regulation do we have here in Massachusetts that either tie us to CDC recommendations and ACIP, or may need to be amended to make sure that we can use evidence and science to drive our decisions and our recommendations,” the commissioner said.
“The work falls into a second bucket, which is how do we maintain access and purchase ability for these vaccines,” Goldstein continued. “And we are making sure that, no matter what happens at the federal level, we will continue to be able to purchase vaccines here in Massachusetts, distribute them across the commonwealth, and make sure there’s access in pediatrics practices, community health centers, hospitals all across the state.”
Gov. Maura Healey, asked Monday how Massachusetts may need to extricate itself from federal vaccine policy, said Goldstein and DPH are evaluating the matter.
“We’re going to continue to provide vaccinations here in Massachusetts,” Healey told reporters.
Kennedy last month announced the CDC is no longer recommending COVID vaccines for healthy pregnant women and children. Goldstein has emphasized COVID shots remain available, and they can prevent serious illness and death for at-risk individuals.
The ACIP is meeting at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, with opening remarks slated for 10 a.m. Wednesday. 
“The work prior to an ACIP meeting is extensive, and the amount of data that are evaluated by working groups and presented to the full committee is enormous,” Goldstein had said earlier in June. “I am interested to see, at the end of this month, brand new members of ACIP that are able to make informed decisions about vaccine policy.”
A previous agenda for this week’s ACIP meeting listed votes on vaccine recommendations for COVID, RSV and flu shots, among other immunizations. The finalized itinerary scraps some votes, and includes a presentation about thimerosal in vaccines and recommendations about the ingredient in flu shots.
Kennedy wrote a book in 2014 about the dangers of thimerosal, which the CDC and health experts have debunked, according to Politico. In her letter, Warren called the ACIP’s planned vote on thimerosal-containing vaccines a “dog whistle for vaccine skeptics.”
As questions swirl around pending federal recommendations and how the public will react to Kennedy’s updated panel, Goldstein emphasized the role of MVPAC in promoting trust in vaccine policy.
“I cannot say this enough, that the damage that is done when people in the federal government talk about vaccines with mis- and disinformation, when they share fringe theories about vaccines, the damage that is done to trust in public health and vaccine programs is enormous,” Goldstein said, without invoking specific individuals or examples. “I have been trying to use my position to speak about the benefits of vaccines as much as I possibly can. I think that we need to continue to do so — all of us.”
Healey called Kennedy a “threat to public health” during the Health Equity Trends Summit earlier this month. She described engaging with the federal government as playing “opposite day” with children.
“If they want to defund science and research, we will fund science and research,” Healey had said, drawing audience applause and cheers. “If they want to dismantle the CDC and vaccine infrastructure, we’re going to find a way to build, and make, and distribute our own, and we’re going to make sure people have access to it equitably.”

Two Delaware high school students have been named national winners in the 2025 “America’s Field Trip” contest, a nationwide initiative tied to the upcoming 250th anniversary of American independence.
Grace Sweeten
Grace Sweeten, a ninth-grader at Sussex Academy in Georgetown, and Vivian Wan, a tenth-grader at Tower Hill School in Wilmington, were among 75 first-place winners selected from thousands of student submissions across the country.
Sweeten was honored for her original artwork, “Mother of Refuge,” while Wan earned recognition for her essay, “The American Mosaic.”
“America’s Field Trip is a transformative opportunity for students across the country to engage with our nation’s history in meaningful, lasting ways,” said Rosie Rios, chair of America250. “Our tentpole programs are intentionally designed to be hands-on, educational, and engaging. America’s Field Trip truly brings the story of America to life and allows a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for these students to experience American history and national treasures up-close.”
Both students’ works will be featured in an upcoming exhibit at the Delaware Public Archives, organizers announced this week.
America’s Field Trip invites students from grades 3 through 12 to reflect creatively on the question, “What does America mean to you?”
This year’s competition drew submissions from all 50 states, five U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia.
First-place winners will take part in field trips to historic and cultural landmarks across the U.S. this summer, while second-place winners receive a $500 prize.
“It’s an honor for Delaware to have two students recognized as first place winners in the America’s Field Trip contest,” said Margaret Hughes, director of Delaware 250. “We’re so proud of what Grace and Vivian have accomplished, and grateful to them for sharing their vision of America.”
The contest is part of a broader educational initiative by America250, the national commission leading preparations for the country’s Semiquincentennial in 2026. Organizers aim to foster civic reflection and participation through hands-on, inclusive programming.
A photo of Wan was not made available on the contest website, and immediate attempts to reach both students for comment were unsuccessful.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-9.31.54-AM.png,,,2025-06-26 11:13:04.751473

Free.,US Senate GOP mega-bill suffers major blow with ruling on Medicaid cuts,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-mega-bill-suffers-major-blow-ruling-medicaid-cuts,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans suffered a significant setback Thursday when the parliamentarian ruled several changes to Medicaid in the “big, beautiful bill” don’t comply with the complex rules for moving a reconciliation package — which means billions of dollars in savings are no longer available for the GOP to offset the cost of tax cuts.Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo. R-Idaho, must rework or completely eliminate nine changes the committee proposed to the health care programs, though more of the panel’s proposals are still under review.Republicans can no longer reduce the amount of federal matching funds for state governments that use their own tax dollars to provide Medicaid coverage for immigrants in the country without proper documentation.The GOP bill cannot bar gender-affirming care for Medicaid patients.And Republicans need to change or scrap a proposal to reduce states’ Medicaid provider tax credits, an issue that is relatively in the weeds of health care policy but has sharply divided the GOP and drawn fierce opposition from states.The changes or eliminations will have a major impact on how much in savings the GOP tax and spending cut bill will generate during the next decade and will likely make the overall package’s deficit impact higher than before. The legislation is intended to extend the 2017 tax cuts and make spending reductions.The ruling might make it more difficult for President Donald Trump and GOP leaders in Congress to get the votes needed to pass the bill at all, let alone before their self-imposed Fourth of July timeline. Senate GOP leaders had said they wanted to begin procedural votes as soon as Friday.The measure already had been stuck on Wednesday amid growing disputes over how Medicaid changes will impact rural hospitals and far more.Senate Budget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who released the parliamentarian's rulings, wrote in a statement that Democrats will continue to advocate for removing dozens of proposals from the bill that they believe don’t meet reconciliation rules.“Republicans are scrambling to rewrite parts of this bill to continue advancing their families lose, and billionaires win agenda, but Democrats stand ready to fully scrutinize any changes and ensure the Byrd Rule is enforced,” Merkley wrote.Crapo’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from States Newsroom.Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., wrote in a statement that the parliamentarian’s ruling will lead to “more than $250 billion in health care cuts removed from the Republicans’ big bad bill.“Democrats fought and won, striking health care cuts from this bill that would hurt Americans’ walking on an economic tightrope. This bill is rotten to its core, and I’ll keep fighting the cuts in this morally bankrupt bill until the end.”The parliamentarian is still deciding whether several health provisions meet reconciliation rules, including language that would block all Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood, effectively blocking Medicaid patients from visiting the organization for routine health services.Federal law already bars funding for abortions with exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient.The parliamentarian will also decide later whether Republicans’ bill can block the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing a Biden-era rule that would require nursing homes to have a nurse working 24 hours a day, seven days a week.",,,,2025-06-26 09:39:58.632206

At a hearing on Beacon Hill, Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability bill was met with praise from lawmakers, but Sen. Barrett and Rep. Turco raised questions about Mass Save and the overall affordability of the green energy transition.
The post Healey’s energy affordability bill gets support, tough questions on Beacon Hill appeared first on CommonWealth B[...]","GOV. MAURA HEALEY’S sweeping energy affordability bill received a largely positive reception from lawmakers at a nearly six-hour hearing on Wednesday, but even lawmakers who lauded the proposal had some concerns. 
Healey unveiled the bill in May in response to a winter that saw sharp increases in natural gas bills across the state. The legislation aims to reduce certain charges on energy bills, keep unnecessary costs from being passed to ratepayers, and expand the state’s authority to explore new nuclear power technologies. 
After a cold winter that had residents across the state struggling to make ends meet, Healey’s aim is to lower rate payer bills while still moving forward on the state’s mandated climate goals. She faces a challenging balancing act as the Trump administration pulls federal funding from climate efforts and takes aim at offshore wind – a potentially abundant source of clean energy for Massachusetts.
Sen. Michael Barrett of Lexington, the chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy who was the driving force behind the climate law which passed in November 2024, said that he was “impressed with the sheer intelligence and ingenuity of the fine print” of the bill.
But he also questioned whether Healey’s plan to allow the Department of Public Utilities to authorize utility companies to issue bonds to fund Mass Save would cost ratepayers more in the long run. “We would move from pay-as-you-go to an alternative that requires the payment of interest on long-term bonds,” said Barrett.  “One would think that would be an additional financing cost, and that over the entire cost of the useful life of the project, more dollars might wind up being spent either by our taxpayers or by our ratepayers.”
Mass Save, which is currently funded entirely through surcharges on utility customers, accounted for the biggest portion of the increase in natural gas rates this past winter. The program’s cost is updated only every three years, and an unusually cold winter amplified the effect of the rate increase.
Rebecca Tepper, the state secretary of energy and environmental affairs, said the DPU would be reviewing any plan to issue bonds for Mass Save, and that the agency would only move forward on allowing this means of financing if it is in the interest of customers. The utility companies would not make a profit on the bonds, she added.
Barrett also expressed concern that, in the absence of offshore wind, the state would be more reliant on solar but that the proposed legislation would lower the rate – known as the “net metering compensation rate” – non-residential solar panel owners are compensated when they send energy back into the grid. According to the Healey administration, Massachusetts has the highest net metering rate in the country, and lowering the rate will save customers an estimated $380 million over 10 years. High net metering rates can mean that the costs of maintaining the electric grid are disproportionately borne by non-solar customers and utility companies might have to raise rates for all customers to offset the revenue lost from paying solar producers at a higher rate.
“We want to indicate we need more solar because offshore wind is going to be very slow off the mark, given what President Trump is doing,” said Barrett. “But in the next breath, we assure people that we’re going to reduce the value of net metering. How are you going to get more solar during a period – when it may be our primary source of clean energy over the next four years – and somehow make it less lucrative to the developers?”
Healey’s undersecretary of energy, Michael Judge, testified that the lowered net metering rate would only impact certain large net metering facilities. Currently, those facilities receive close to “double what any other state in the country provides to solar,” he said. 
“I don’t think it should have any … negative impact on solar development or the pace of solar development in Massachusetts, but it should allow us to build it at a lower cost,” he added.
The legislation gives the state more flexibility in how energy is procured from the state. Barrett asked Healey to clarify if the state would include sources like solar, nuclear, and hydropower under the new procurement framework. Elizabeth Mahoney, commissioner of the Department of Energy Resources, said that all different sources will be part of the procurement plan to meet the state’s climate goals.
Rep. Jeffrey Turco, who represents Winthrop and parts of Revere, expressed doubts that energy affordability and the transition to green energy could go hand in hand.
“What is the priority of the administration: Green energy or rate pay relief?” asked Turco. “Because it seems to me that the reality of the last year or two with our rates is that you can’t have both.”
In response, Healey said she was taking an “all of the above approach” to get as much energy as possible onto the grid from different sources. She said that she is looking at “all options” and that she wants to address some of the “immediate hurt” of the energy affordability crisis.
“[With] some of the programs that have served the Commonwealth well – where can we scale back right now?” said Healey. “Because people have got to be able to put food on the table, especially with the other the other cuts that that we’re likely to see from the federal administration.”
Healey’s legislation would also phase out a program that provides incentives to businesses for installing “alternative energy systems” that contribute to the state’s clean energy goals by increasing energy efficiency, reform the competitive supply market to protect customers from predatory practices by third-party electric suppliers, and allow the Department of Public Utilities to cap the amount of month-to-month bill increases.
Carrie Katan from the nonprofit Green Energy Consumer Alliance said that her group supports the consumer protections in Healey’s bill around third-party electric suppliers – which have come under fire for predatory marketing and major price hikes. Many environmental and energy affordability advocates, including Katan, as well as more than a dozen municipal leaders across the state support an outright ban on third-party suppliers.
“If we cannot get a ban, we would love if there is legislation that protects people from the worst abuses of the system,” Katan said in an interview. “That would still be a massive win for the people of the commonwealth.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Mike Duggan may be mayor of the Motor City, but he was one of the most popular attractions on the vehicle-free Mackinac Island during the Detroit Regional Chamber’s annual policy conference last month.
As mayor of Detroit, Duggan is one of two people – along with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – guaranteed a keynote speaking slot during the Mackinac Policy Conference.
He used this year’s address to roll out his plan to invest $4.5 billion in schools while promoting his independent campaign for governor, contrasting himself with Republican and Democratic attack ads alike.
The next day, he highlighted Detroit’s comeback during a panel with Rocket Mortgage founder and philanthropist Dan Gilbert.
April Ryan, Washington bureau chief and White House correspondent for Black Press USA, underscored Duggan’s arguments about partisan politics during a separate panel on the final day of the conference, saying Duggan’s polling – indicating that he pulls nearly equal amounts of support from Republicans and Democrats – shows “the system is broken.”
“Certain groups felt … like they weren’t heard. And the problem is we have to find a way to get everyone under the umbrella,” Ryan said. “That’s why independents are on the rise, and people are listening, because people don’t feel heard. People want to feel seen.”
The Michigan Advance caught up with Duggan about his campaign taking on both the Democratic and Republican candidates for governor as an independent.
The Democratic field to succeed term-limited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer currently includes Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki.
Republicans who have entered the race include former Attorney General Mike Cox, U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.), former House Speaker Tom Leonard, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former congressional candidate Anthony Hudson and construction manager William Null.

The following are excerpts from the Advance’s interview with Duggan:
 
You mentioned during your keynote address that a bad system will always beat a good person. If we’re in a bad system now, what does that mean for your campaign?
“Well, I think people in Michigan are really internalizing now that with this divided state and the continual 50-50 Republican and Democrat split in the Legislature that we are going to keep swinging back and forth. And people are feeling the impact of that. They feel the impact in the schools. They feel the impact in the economic policies. I’m offering a different alternative, and I’m finding a lot of people receptive.”
 
You mentioned how policy goals will swing back and forth with Republican and Democratic governors and legislators. You’re running as an independent. How effective can you be at changing that as governor if you don’t have similarly independent legislators to work with?
“When you have a 56-54 margin, and you’re in the 56, your most extreme three or four people control your agenda. And that pulls the two parties to the extremes – what makes people so angry in these evenly divided systems – because you’re obsessed with having a majority and your majority passing a bill that your party gets credit for.
“I’m going to try a different approach: The approach I took at the city of Detroit and City Council, where I sat down with Council, people had their own opinions, and I said, we’re going to agree on principles that apply to all of us.
“I laid out a set of principles for the schools that said let’s put $4.5 billion in the schools without raising taxes, let’s have a clear reading curriculum, let’s build the CTE program, and let’s hold principals and superintendents accountable for performance.
“I think most people in the two parties can agree to that. Now, there’s people on one extreme that say you shouldn’t have to have accountability in schools, and people on the other extreme that says you ought to have vouchers. But I think most people in this state would say put money in the school system, teach the kids to read, give us CTE options that are real and hold them accountable.
“That’s what I believe. And I think I can forge a coalition in the middle of Republicans and Democrats who say this is the Michigan solution, it’s not a Democratic or a Republican solution.”
 
You’ve talked about the purpose of the campaign being to take on a broken system. Why run for governor rather than, say, a ballot proposal to literally change the system?
“Well, we had a ballot proposal, right? We eliminated gerrymandering, and now you have an evenly divided Legislature – which is the state, it actually reflects the state. It had an unintended consequence that you have almost complete gridlock in the Legislature.
“I think what has been done at the legislative level, or the ballot proposal level, has been done. I think you have to have a change in politics.
“If you watch what happened in Detroit when I ran in 2013, the definition of politics in Detroit was us versus them. It was Black versus white, city versus suburbs, city versus Lansing. And people thought that a white guy in an 83% Black city would never have a chance to be elected.
“But the people of Detroit have overwhelmingly supported me, because there were things more important to them in terms of common values and common strategies.
“I think with what’s happened in the city of Detroit, by people pulling together, not only have I done well, our City Council is at a 60% approval rating. You don’t see that in other cities. Our legislative branch found that a consistent plan that delivered results was good for them as well as good for the mayor.”
 
You’ve argued that people are tired of Democrats versus Republicans. Why is Democrats versus Republicans versus Mike Duggan preferable?
“We’re going to get a chance to see, but just look at the toxic ads that you have. The Gallup polls show we’re down to 27% of Americans who consider themselves Democrats, all time low, 27% Republicans, all time low, 43% independents, all time high.
“But the campaign managers know that you’re starting out with only a 27% base. The way they get from 27% to 51% isn’t to explain their affordable housing plan, it’s demonize the other person.
“I showed the ad calling people pedophile protectors and insane and the ads that people are running. They run the ads because all you have to do is demonize the other party to 51%.
“If I’m in the race, you can’t just demonize the Republicans or Democrats. You’re going to have to actually say what you’re for, and it is going to be a very different dynamic.
“I think there are a handful of congressional people who have already figured this out and are figuring out ‘okay, this guy’s going to get 30-40% of the vote as an independent, I’m going to need his independent voters to vote for me in a U.S. Senate race or in a Congressional race.’
“You’re going to start to see, I believe, other candidates modify their positions to talk about what they’re for in order to get elected. At least that’s what I’m hoping to do, because I’m running to change the system.”
 
Does running as an independent force you to spend more time convincing people that you are a viable candidate rather than being able to talk about those issues?
“For sure it does. But I lived this once already.
“If you had been in the living rooms with me when I ran for mayor, and people would show up and say, I like you, but there’s no way a white guy can win an 83% Black city, and then after a couple months, they saw me the second and third time, and some of their friends are saying, I’m looking at this guy, and they said, maybe he can. And by the time we were done, I carried 92% of the precincts.
“But what you’re saying is absolutely right. It wasn’t the first time, it wasn’t the second time, but I’m seeing the same thing here. People are showing up in large numbers, mainly out of curiosity to hear the independent guy.
“I was in Lexington last Tuesday, town of 1,000 people; 100 people showed up and spent an hour and a half with me. At some point, I said to them, how many of you would have showed up if I were running as a Democrat? Half the hands in the room went up, and then everybody started laughing.
“There is something about this independent candidacy that is getting people to come out and listen. But you’re right, I’ve got to convince them, once they hear, that an independent can win, and that’s what the campaign’s about.”
 
You’ve rejected a lot of the conventional wisdom about independent campaigns and have argued that the vast majority of people are ready for that independent change. If that’s not the challenge you face, what do you view as the biggest challenges to your campaign?
“The size of the state.
“In Detroit, I did 250 house parties. I was in every neighborhood, sitting in living rooms. Now I’m going to a farm in Saginaw County, I’m in a house in Ottawa, I’m up at a bar in New Baltimore. I’m enjoying it, but it’s a bigger state. I’m going to have to spend a lot of time going to every corner of it. The challenge is just the physical geography of the state.
“The folks in New Baltimore, a whole crowd of people, and after an hour, somebody raises their hand and asks, ‘why isn’t everybody in this state going to vote for you?’ And if I have time to talk to them, I would win the vast majority of the state. But I need the time to talk.”
 
You mentioned Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has found exactly the right approach to dealing with President Donald Trump. You appeared at a number of Democratic campaign events in 2024, where we heard very dramatic rhetoric about the threat that he poses. Is there a mismatch between the rhetoric we heard on the campaign trail last year and this strategy now?
“That rhetoric didn’t come from me. And you can see the rhetoric didn’t work. Calling Trump a fascist was not a good campaign strategy. People wanted to know ‘what are you going to do?’
“I was mayor the first Trump term, I didn’t have any issues. We worked fine with the administration. I stayed out of the crossfire. I wasn’t one of the people who engaged in Twitter wars with the president to boost my Democratic status. It’s just not who I am.
“Ben Carson was the HUD Secretary under Trump. I had him to the house for dinner. He came from Detroit originally. I got funding for lead programs to take lead out of houses in Detroit in the first Trump administration.
“I’m the kind of person that says I don’t work for the Republicans or Democrats, I work for my residents in Detroit. Ultimately, I work for the people of Michigan. And I think Gretchen Whitmer has shown enormous courage in the last month. She knew she was going to take grief from the Democrats. But to save 5,000 jobs at Selfridge that she couldn’t get done under a Democratic president, it was remarkable what she accomplished.”
 
If you’re elected governor, would you have a PowerPoint for your State of the State?
“I’m not going to stand and read a teleprompter, I know that. I don’t know how to use a teleprompter. So yeah, I think you can assume it will be a PowerPoint. You’re the first person to ask me that. That’s funny.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AMR_0052-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 09:39:58.632206

(Photo by Lynn Hicks)The event featured many of the trappings of a law school commencement: The graduates’ families came to campus carrying flowers, a state Supreme Court justice sat amid the dignitaries, and speeches overflowed with words of praise and promise.
“You have faced challenges that most cannot imagine,” Drake Law School Dean Roscoe Jones told the graduates on June 13. “You have not only changed your lives, you have also changed the lives of your families and communities.”
The pomp and circumstance matched the occasion’s significance. Only nine people – six men, three women – completed the rigorous program with strict requirements. Some finished in two years, and one took four. Another had graduated four years ago, relapsed, and repeated.
Polk County’s Intensive Supervision Drug Court is indeed a long, difficult journey, filled with 12-step meetings, curfews, community service, court hearings, and “dropping UAs.” Many of the graduates said they didn’t believe they would make it.
“A year ago, I was ready to give up. Staff wouldn’t give up on me,” said one graduate, Rodney Davis. “I now have a life that has meaning,” including a supportive employer, a commercial driver’s license, and a future.
Drug court graduation is one of the most inspiring things I’ve witnessed in a courtroom. It also leaves me wanting more: more graduates, more success stories, more treatment programs across the state. Iowa could do much more to expand this alternative to prison.

Drug courts are reserved for defendants whose addictions lead to crime. They are at high risk of repeatedly stealing or committing other offenses to feed their habits.
Polk County created the state’s first adult criminal drug court in 1996, just seven years after the nation’s first drug court was established in Miami.
I attended my first drug court graduation in 1999. One of the graduates was a bear of a man who showed me a photo of his emaciated face when he was regularly using meth. He gushed about how the court had changed his life. It was the first time I’d ever seen a defendant hug a judge.
Such happy outcomes have been documented in multiple studies in Iowa and nationally. While results vary depending on many factors, graduates have lower rates of recidivism and substance use, and the treatment is far more cost-effective than incarceration, studies show.
An Iowa Department of Corrections study showed that every $1 spent on drug court returns a $9.61 benefit over a 10-year time frame.
Despite the results, funding has been inconsistent and depends on a mix of local support, state appropriations, and federal grants. “In general, Drug Courts have been left to their own means to fund and provide training to Drug Court Judges and staff, identify treatment providers, and otherwise enhance their programs,” according to a 2018 study of Iowa specialty courts by the National Center for State Courts.
Now that the Iowa Legislature has finally come up with a structure to spend opioid settlement money, expanding drug courts and other treatment programs should be on list of uses.
In Polk County, drug court graduations are held two or three times a year. Nine people is considered a large class; the graduation on June 13 occurred in the courtroom of the Drake Legal Clinic to accommodate the crowd.
Currently, 24 people are in the county’s drug court program, charged with crimes including theft, fraud, forgery, and burglary. Many more defendants qualify, if the program had more staff.
Drug court isn’t cheap, as it requires a judge, prosecutor, defense attorney, probation officer, coordinator, and support staff. But it’s generally a third of the cost, per participant, of prison.
The morning before the noon graduation on June 13, District Judge Jeffrey Ferrell presided over the regular routine of drug court. Defendants reported on their progress and gave updates on their work, community service, and treatment plans.
The reports went deeper than that, however, as the participants shared about larger issues they were confronting: past traumas, personality conflicts, relationship issues, and other root causes of their addictions.
The staff challenged the participants with some of the mantras of drug court:

“Own your mistakes.”
“All the truth, all the time.”
“Your worst day sober is better than your best day high.”

Later, participants listened to the graduates reinforce those lessons. The grads shared how they “learned to love myself” and “untangle the mess inside me.” They thanked their family, court officials, sponsors, therapists, and each other.
Graduate Jeremiah Bender summed up the goal: “Recovery isn’t just about staying clean, it’s about building a life worth living.”

To identify student work written by artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, many California colleges and universities rely on Turnitin, a plagiarism detection service. But the company’s tools aren’t always accurate, and when it falsely flags work done by humans as AI-generated, students are caught in the crossfire.
As CalMatters’ Tara García Mathewson explains, in 2025 California State University paid $163,000 to use Turnitin’s tool to identify AI-generated writing. Several University of California campuses spend more than $100,000 per year on the detector, while nearly three-quarters of California community colleges now use it. 
One of Turnitin’s biggest selling points is its robust repository of student writing, which it uses to train its detection tools. As of June 2025, the company reported having a database of 1.9 billion student papers. Turnitin licenses its technology to colleges under the requirement that the company gets to keep students’ writings in perpetuity.
Besides the privacy concerns that come with handing over students’ papers to a third party, tools marketed to identify AI-generated content also make mistakes. The Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, found that one in five students either were wrongly accused of using generative AI to cheat or knew someone who had been.
That’s what happened to Nilka Desiree Abbas in 2023. While taking a political science course at San Bernardino Valley College, Abbas received a zero on an assignment with a message from her professor saying she had used ChatGPT.

Abbas: “It took me so long to go back to school. To be falsely accused felt devastating.”

Though she ultimately passed the course, the incident rattled her: For her remaining classes, Abbas took photos as she worked on assignments for proof of her original work.

Budget negotiations continue

With less than a week before the fiscal year begins on July 1, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-controlled Legislature are inching closer to a budget agreement that seeks to plug the state’s $12 billion budget hole, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
Both parties reached a tentative deal Tuesday, though negotiations are ongoing as lawmakers iron out the final details of the $321 billion spending plan. Newsom, for example, is calling for a provision that would speed up housing development near public transit, but the proposal is facing pushback in the state Senate.
The draft deal rejects some of Newsom’s proposed cuts, including reinstating a Medi-Cal asset limit that would have disqualified thousands of existing enrollees who are elderly or disabled. But it does retain some of Newsom’s other plans, such as freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for adults who do not have legal status. Legislators also successfully added one-time funding for the anti-crime measure Proposition 36.

Lawmakers, unions fight over construction wages

Speaking of the budget, a provision buried in the budget agreement could signal that lawmakers are nearing a deal that would set a new minimum wage rate for housing construction workers, report CalMatters’ Ben Christopher. 
If passed, the new rates would mark a turning point in a longstanding debate about “prevailing wages,” which has loomed over the legislative politics of California housing. These state-determined wages vary by occupation and location, and are generally comparable to union wages.
The proposal would carve out exceptions to California’s environmental laws to make it easier to construct certain housing projects, while putting forward a significantly lower, more developer-friendly alternative to the prevailing wage rate. Supporters of the deal say the new standards represent a wage increase since it applies to construction projects not currently covered by prevailing wages. 
But the influential State Building and Construction Trades Council slammed the proposal, calling it “harmful and unprecedented.” It argues that the arrangement would “devastate construction workers” by undercutting pay standards.

Ohio Republicans passed a $60 billion operating budget that includes tax cuts for the wealthy, funding for a new Cleveland Browns stadium, and restrictions on education. The GOP says it is a fiscally conservative and responsible budget. The Democrats say it is a budget for billionaires — not the working-class Ohioans.
In the dead of night, the Republicans on the Conference Committee approved a final budget. But while Ohioans were sleeping at 1 a.m. Wednesday morning — we were there. We only got the information less than an hour before the full Senate and House floor votes on Wednesday afternoon — the same as the Democrats. Even Republicans didn’t get the full language, many told us.




“Take care of all the major programs I think Ohioans expect us to do,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart (R-Ashville) said.




However, this was the first budget bill to not get a single Democratic vote since 2001.
“I cannot tell the people of Ohio that this is a budget that’s working for them,” The top Democrat on the Finance Committee, Ranking Member Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Westlake), said.
The final budget proposal ranges from changes to taxes, education, social services, health care and much more.
In the Senate, there was a 23-10 vote. Only state Sen. Bill Blessing (R-Colerain Township) joined the Democrats to vote no.
In the House, it was 59-38. State Reps. Tim Barhorst (R-Fort Loramie), Levi Dean (R-Xenia), Ron Ferguson (R-Wintersville), Scott Oelslager (R-North Canton) and Michelle Teska (R-Clear Creek Township) joined the Democrats.
Income tax
They passed a 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
“We are making Ohio more competitive, more open for business,” Stewart said.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of more than $1.1 billion in the general revenue fund. This was made up by cutting social services and some tax exemptions. Sweeney said cuts came to public education.
Education
Public schools will face hundreds of millions of cuts from their expected budget, but the funding formula will stay intact for the most part.
“We’re underfunding our schools by at least a billion dollars,” Sweeney said.
Lawmakers would also be giving additional school funding to high-performing public school districts.
There is a cap on districts’ rainy day funds at 40% carryover from the previous revenue fund. This would mean that the schools would have to refund anything above that back to the taxpayer to provide property tax relief.
“We’re looking at more local control,” Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino (R-Kirtland) said.
“How is it local control if we’re capping carryover at 40%?” I asked him.
“It’s the budget commission that is representing the people,” he responded, also adding that there are exceptions so that the districts can carry over more than 40%, as long as they are put in a capital fund instead of operating. However, schools are unable to move money back to the operating fund once they are in the capital.
The House wanted to cap the districts at 30% and the Senate 50%, which is why they settled in the middle.
If voters pass a school levy, the bill allows county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away, if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
The bill also eliminates levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it prohibits them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
It also prohibits a school district from submitting any current expense levy to voters if it has a general fund carry-over balance of more than 100% of general fund expenditures in the preceding fiscal year. It excludes renewal levies, though.
They kept the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, guaranteeing admission to a public university for each high school graduate in the top 10% of their graduating class. The students would also get $5,000 each year in financial aid.
However, the bill requires the student to sign a “statement of commitment” to stay in Ohio for three years after graduating.
They also give more than $30 million to five “intellectual diversity” centers at different public colleges across the state. These centers were created to combat what some consider liberal bias at universities.
The budget will provide about $2.5 billion over the biennium for the state’s voucher system — providing taxpayer dollars for students to attend nonpublic schools. This includes a new education savings account program, or ESAs, which is a way for families to get state money to purchase “educational goods and services,” including tuition at nonchartered, nonpublic schools.
This comes a day after a Franklin County court ruled Ohio’s EdChoice voucher program to be unconstitutional.
Property taxes
The restrictions on levies and carryover caps in the education budget are meant to give relief to property taxpayers. District cash carryovers have increased year-over-year from $3.6 billion to $10.5 billion since tracking began in 2012, the GOP reported.
The bill also allows the boards of county commissioners to provide up to a 2.5% owner-occupancy tax credit and a permissive homestead exemption for those who qualify.
Cleveland Browns
The Browns will be getting $600 million for their new Brook Park stadium. The budget calls for the state to take legal ownership of $1.7 billion in unclaimed funds, setting a clock on how long people have to file claims and get reunited with their missing money.
That’s a major change for Ohio, which currently holds unclaimed funds in perpetuity. The budget proposal would give people a decade to claim their money before it becomes the state’s property. Lawmakers want to grab $1.7 billion out of Ohio’s $4.8 billion pool of unclaimed funds right away – and then continue taking money on a rolling basis, after a decade of holding it.
A last-minute amendment to the compromise budget bill, released late Tuesday, would change a state law designed to make it harder for pro sports teams to leave publicly subsidized facilities, clearing a significant obstacle from the Browns’ road to Brook Park.
The new language says the so-called Modell law, designed to prevent major sports teams from pulling up stakes, would only come into play if a team chose to leave the state.
The proposed changes to the law are likely to end a court battle that’s just getting started and take leverage away from the City of Cleveland, which is fighting to keep the Browns on the lakefront or negotiate a better exit deal if the team leaves.
Pensions
First reported by us on Tuesday, state lawmakers chose to remove the majority of educators’ voices from the state’s retired teachers’ pension fund board.
Amid legislators’ concerns of an alleged corruption scheme threatening the fund, they have decided to reduce the number of elected positions and add more political appointments.
A provision in the bill would change the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers—five contributing and two retired—to three elected after seats are phased out over several years. Two of the educator seats will be for actives and only one retiree seat. Each elected member will be able to finish their term, but once their term is out, four of the seven seats will not be refilled.
Those four removed educator seats will be filled with newly appointed members. Right now, the governor gets to appoint one investment expert. The Speaker of the House and the Senate President jointly appoint an expert. The treasurer gets an appointee, and so does the director of the Department of Education and Workforce.
“The state legislature established these pension systems and has an ongoing responsibility to ensure the long-term health of the fund for retired and active teachers,” Provision Proposer State Rep. Adam Bird (R-New Richmond) exclusively told me Tuesday. “The ongoing turmoil has clarified the need for the General Assembly to rebalance the Board composition.”
Health and child care
Numerous changes to Medicaid could put hundreds of thousands of Ohioans at risk of losing health insurance. The legislators also restricted access to Medicaid for babies.
The lawmakers funded a Child Care Choice program, which would provide millions for eligible families to cover child care services. There is also money going toward eyesight programs and families with children with disabilities.
The budget also cut DeWine’s proposed pediatric cancer research funding by half.
Miscellanous
Other provisions in the massive budget bill have nothing to do with spending, including:

Prohibiting SNAP for “sugar-sweetened beverages”
Requiring public libraries to place books related to sexual orientation or gender in an area away from the public
Adding more reporting requirements for abortion
Enshrining into state law that there are only two sexes
Stops funding for both youth homeless shelters and mental health services that support transgender or nonbinary identities
An ability to lock lost or stolen EBT cards

“At the end of the day, we have to remember that budgets are about choices,” Sweeney said. “We were elected to make choices for the people of Ohio, and we believe that this budget is making the wrong choices.”
Next steps
Since both the House and the Senate passed the bill, it will be sent to the governor’s desk. DeWine will decide which provisions to line-item veto.
Line-item vetoing is the ability for the governor to pick and choose which policies within a larger piece of legislation get to stay or must go.
In the past operating budget, he issued about 40.
We will continue breaking down what is in the 6,000-page bill in the coming days.

That was the main message Wednesday for an online presentation featuring top executives from four organizations that have membership straddling the border. The presentation came just days before the teams face a deadline from Kansas on its proposal to build new stadiums for both teams.
“We get this question a lot,” said Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council. “Does the regional business and civic community have a preference for which side of the state line or which specific location the teams land? No. As long as the teams land within the KC region, we’re going to support their decision, full stop.”
The presentation focused on how Kansas City competes with other metro areas. At no point during the debates in Kansas or Missouri over public financing for stadiums has either team said it was considering moving out of the region.
Such a move would require the concurrence of other team owners. No city or state other than Missouri and Kansas have made public overtures to the teams.
The sentiment that the state line was the smallest consideration for Kansas City businesses was echoed by the other participants, the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, which hosted the presentation, the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City and the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation.
“The more that we can stand united as one KC, and understand that our competition are those other regions that want the assets we have or are competing to attract what we want to get as well, I think we’re going to be stronger and we’re going to win,” said Joe Reardon, CEO of the Kansas City chamber.
Missouri lawmakers this month approved a plan to finance up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, committing almost $1.5 billion in future tax revenue. The current facilities, Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium, were opened in the early 1970s and almost all other stadiums built near that time are no longer in use, Reardon noted in the presentation.
Kansas, under a plan approved last year by the Kansas Legislature, is offering to pay up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums if the teams cross the state border.
During the debates in both states, the focus was on winning the “border war”.
For Missouri, the loss of either team would mean another major league team leaving the state. St. Louis lost the NFL’s Rams in 2015, the football Cardinals in 1987 and the NBA’s Hawks in 1968. Kansas City lost Major League Baseball’s Athletics in 1967 and the Kings NBA franchise in 1985.
Kansas City is the smallest market that has both an NFL team and a Major League Baseball team.
For Kansas, it would be the first time a team from the NFL or Major League Baseball called the state its home.
“Our competition is not in Missouri or Kansas, it’s outside the region,” Cowden said. “We need to keep them at bay at arm’s length. This is not, in our opinion, about a border war. It truly is about a border solution.”
The success of Kansas City sports teams, especially the Chiefs, has raised the national and international profile of the region, said Kathy Nelson of the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation and Visit KC.
“They are opening doors to businesses like we never heard,” she said.
The Chiefs have played in five of the six most recent Super Bowls. The 2025 game had a national audience of 127 million and international audience estimated at 62 million. The romance between Taylor Swift and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has also boosted the city’s profile, she said.
The Royals made the playoffs last year for the first time since winning the World Series in 2015. They have a more regional audience, she said, with 80% of game attendees living within 75 miles of downtown Kansas City.
“Nothing else puts us on a global stage like our sports teams,” Nelson said. “There’s nothing else like this.”

,California,2025-06-26 12:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,California colleges spend millions to catch plagiarism and AI. Is the faulty tech worth it?,Tara García Mathewson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/06/ai-detector/,Colleges and universities renew Turnitin subscriptions year after year even though its flawed detectors are expensive and require students to let the company keep their papers forever.,"In summary
Colleges and universities renew Turnitin subscriptions year after year even though its flawed detectors are expensive and require students to let the company keep their papers forever.


It has been more than two years since the release of ChatGPT created widespread dismay over generative AI’s threat to academic integrity. Why would students write anything themselves, instructors wondered, if a chatbot could do it for them? Indeed, many students have taken the bait, if not to write entire essays, then certainly to draft an outline, refine their ideas or clean up their writing before submitting it.
And as faculty members grapple with what this means for grading, tech companies have proved yet again that there’s money to be made from panic. Turnitin, a longtime leader in the plagiarism-detection market, released a new tool within six months of ChatGPT’s debut to identify AI-generated writing in students’ assignments. In 2025 alone, records show the California State University system collectively paid an extra $163,000 for it, pushing total spending this year to over $1.1 million. Most of these campuses have licensed Turnitin’s plagiarism detector since 2014.
That detector first became popular among professors when the internet made it easy for students to copy and paste information from websites into their assignments. In the AI detector, faculty members sought both a way to discourage students from using ChatGPT on their homework and a way to identify the AI-generated writing when they saw it.  
But the technology offers only a shadow of accurate detection: It highlights any matching text, whether properly cited or not; it flags everything that mirrors AI’s writing style, whether a student used AI inappropriately or not. And Turnitin licenses this technology to colleges while demanding “perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable and sublicensable” rights to student writing. The company has used these rights to build a massive database of student papers, which it uses to market the superiority of its existing products as well as build new ones, including the AI detector. Turnitin has become so valuable that in 2019 Advance Publications paid $1.75 billion to acquire it, more than the total amount raised by all ed-tech startups the prior year, EdSurge noted at the time.
To understand the full range of consequences stemming from Turnitin’s place in higher education, CalMatters and The Markup interviewed dozens of students, faculty members and administrators across the state and obtained Turnitin purchase orders documenting the amount paid over time by approximately 60 colleges there. This investigation revealed institutions willing to renew Turnitin subscriptions year after year despite the cost, faulty technology and concerns about privacy and intellectual property raised by the company’s ever-expanding database of papers.
Turnitin tries to make the gray area of academic dishonesty into something black-and-white, and many faculty members drive demand, searching for the promise of algorithmic accuracy. But honest students are caught in the crossfire of an arms race between technology that mimics human speech and technology that claims to identify it.
The rise of Turnitin
In 2004 Wendy Brill-Wynkoop, a photography professor at College of the Canyons, chaired her campus’s technology committee. She became one of the first Turnitin users at the large community college north of Los Angeles, testing out the software before campuswide adoption. Purchasing records obtained by CalMatters and The Markup show Brill-Wynkoop’s license cost just $120 in 2004. The following year, College of the Canyons paid 75 cents per student and less than $6,500 total to make the tool available to all faculty members for as many papers as they wanted to scan. This year, the college paid almost $47,000.
As teaching and learning increasingly shifted online throughout the early 2000s and 2010s, Turnitin became more embedded in classes. College of the Canyons, like many institutions, paid extra to integrate the plagiarism checker into its online learning management system, where faculty members had begun to post assignments and reading materials and students were expected to submit their papers. Turnitin’s default settings, once integrated, are to scan every assignment, not just those that professors suspect are plagiarized. Besides accelerating the growth of the company’s student-paper database, this puts the tool in front of faculty members who otherwise wouldn’t have used it.

In fact, Brill-Wynkoop had largely stopped using Turnitin to check student work after a few years. “If I had a student who I suspected wasn’t using their own words, I’d pop the phrase into Google and then could just show them,” she said. “I wouldn’t have gone back to [Turnitin].” But since her college built it into the system she was already using to read student papers, she found herself checking the automated reports again.
When the pandemic shut down in-person instruction on campuses nationwide in 2020, fresh anxiety over academic integrity created another windfall for Turnitin. The GovSpend database of government-purchasing records shows a nationwide spike in Turnitin contracts during the 2020-21 school year. And in California, at least, many colleges processed more cheating accusations that year, too, according to academic dishonesty case counts obtained by The Markup and CalMatters via public-records requests. Those case counts dropped — sometimes precipitously — with the return to in-person learning but climbed again when the release of ChatGPT gave Turnitin its next crisis to monetize.
This year’s $47,000 contract with Turnitin for plagiarism and AI detection pushed the total spent by College of the Canyons to over half a million dollars.
Turnitin executives did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Worldwide, the company licenses its software to more than 16,000 institutions that cumulatively enroll over 71 million students. Almost three-quarters of California community colleges now use it, as does the entire California State University system, except Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Cal Poly canceled its contract last year saying not enough faculty used Turnitin to justify the cost, but not before it spent $171,000 on the detectors from 2020 to 2024. Cal State campuses have spent a combined $6 million on Turnitin since 2019 alone, according to records obtained by CalMatters and The Markup. Several University of California campuses spend more than $100,000 per year on the detector, which Turnitin licenses for a per-student fee.
As part of this investigation, CalMatters and The Markup tracked down more than $15 million in purchases of Turnitin plagiarism-prevention software across 57 institutions. Of course, since California is home to 149 public colleges and universities, this amount represents just a fraction of the total spending statewide. And while College of the Canyons released 21 years of receipts, most campuses shared only three to seven.
TABLE: Amount spent on Turnitin contracts at California colleges, according to records. View on calmatters.org.
Robbie Torney is the senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, a national nonprofit headquartered in San Francisco that does research and advocacy work around how young people use technology. He said $15 million is a lot of money to spend on a tool with such limited value. He pointed to troubling reports of Turnitin erroneously flagging student writing as AI-generated and equally troubling accounts of students using simple workarounds to undermine the AI detectors.
“It’s probably better to invest in training for professors and teachers,” Torney said, “and also creating some frameworks for universities to message to students how they can and can’t use AI, rather than trying to use a surveillance methodology to detect AI in student writing.”
Yet many faculty members still want the tool, and colleges have continued paying for it year after year. Records show the Los Rios Community College District, in the Sacramento area, has paid almost $750,000 since 2018 to license Turnitin’s antiplagiarism software. In the Los Angeles Community College District, this year’s license alone cost $265,000. And UC Berkeley is just a few years into a 10-year, nearly $1.2-million contract of its own.
Amassing student papers
Turnitin helps convince college leaders to buy its tools by arguing it knows student writing better than any other company in the world. It has been making this case for decades by pointing to the size of its database, regularly updating its website with the latest student-paper count — 1.9 billion as of June 2025.
Brill-Wynkoop heard the same pitch back in the early 2000s: Instructors could catch a student turning in a peer’s paper from a previous semester with Turnitin. But the company doesn’t need to keep papers for decades to accomplish this.
The Community College League of California signed an agreement in 2016 with a company called VeriCite, locking in pricing for any of the state’s 116 community colleges that wanted its plagiarism-prevention software. VeriCite also claimed to help colleges catch students turning in their peers’ papers. But the tool only made student papers searchable to faculty members on campuses covered by the contract, and it gave them a chance to opt out of letting VeriCite pool their students’ work. The company claimed no rights to student intellectual property or copyright over their work.
After Turnitin bought the company in 2018, a new set of terms and conditions took effect: Now student papers go into Turnitin’s global database and the company maintains a perpetual, royalty-free license over all of them.
When Turnitin acquired another plagiarism-detection company, Unicheck, in 2020, the El Camino College student newspaper reported that the institution switched vendors rather than put up with Turnitin’s contract terms. Still, the vast majority of colleges and universities across California continue to hand over student writing to Turnitin in the name of plagiarism prevention.

Jesse Stommel, an associate professor at the University of Denver, started speaking out about the company’s database of student papers in 2011, when he discovered his dissertation was in it. As a writing instructor, he takes issue with schools unquestioningly handing over original student work to a for-profit company.
In his syllabus, where the university requires him to include a statement about Turnitin, Stommel tells students, “It is my commitment to you that I will not submit any of your work to Turnitin. Plagiarism-detection software like Turnitin monetizes student intellectual property and contributes to a culture of suspicion in education. I trust you. I trust that your work is your own.” He then encourages students to ask him if they have questions about how to properly cite sources and directs them to an essay he co-wrote if they want to learn more about Turnitin or how to protect their intellectual property.
Students have protested Turnitin use too. An undergrad at McGill University, in Canada, failed multiple assignments in 2003 after refusing to submit them to Turnitin. He appealed to the university administration, ultimately winning the right to have his papers graded without the technology.
In 2007, high schoolers in Virginia and Arizona sued iParadigms, Turnitin’s parent company at the time, arguing that its database violated their copyright over their own writing. The courts disagreed. The students also lost on appeal, but some colleges still warn their faculty against using free online plagiarism checkers because of privacy concerns inherent in handing student work over to third-party companies.
Turnitin says it doesn’t “monetize” student writing, per se, but it has raised its prices since releasing an AI detector, which the company developed using that writing.
Brill-Wynkoop said she and her colleagues never thought that the student-paper database could one day become a source of profit for Turnitin. “That makes me feel bad as a faculty member, that I encouraged my students to use something, and now, I don’t know,” she said. “None of us thought about big data and how it would be used in the future.”
‘Caught in the middle’
For today’s undergraduates, routine surveillance and violations of privacy are an unavoidable part of college life. Emily Ibarra, who just finished her second year at Cal State Northridge, said she has never even used ChatGPT. Yet, like all students on her campus and many millions more across the country, she has to deal with the consequences of widespread suspicion about her generation’s integrity.
“That culture is getting normalized here, of professors being able to take the furthest lengths possible to make sure [students aren’t cheating],” she said. “It kind of makes you feel defeated before you even start.” 
When Ibarra started college, she panicked at the sight of her first Turnitin “similarity report.” Some faculty members let students see the reports as soon as they turn in their assignments, while others show students the reports only if they want to discuss a problem.

“At first I didn’t know what it was,” Ibarra said. “It shows green, yellow, red, so at first I thought it was grading the quality of my writing.” On a short assignment, she said, it’s almost impossible to avoid a “yellow” report because Turnitin’s text-matching scanners will flag quoted material and suggest it could be plagiarized. So far, none of Ibarra’s professors have accused her of academic dishonesty, but the risk, she said — even if she doesn’t intentionally plagiarize or use ChatGPT — is “really stressful.”
Ibarra has a tool called Grammarly installed on her computer that she has been using since high school to catch spelling and grammar mistakes; only now, she said, some professors at Cal State Northridge tell students not to even use spell-check tools because they’re bolstered by AI. Microsoft Word, Google Docs and Grammarly now all rely on the same algorithms that create ChatGPT’s human-sounding responses to suggest improvements to users’ writing. Ibarra says she uses Grammarly only to correct misspellings and missed commas, but, like other students interviewed for this story, she isn’t always sure when appropriate use of ubiquitous technology veers into academic dishonesty.
Joshua Hurst, who just finished his junior year at Cal State Northridge, said Turnitin flagged his writing in the spring of 2024. He hadn’t used ChatGPT to craft the assignment, but he had used Grammarly to clean up his writing before turning it in. His professor didn’t dock his grade, but Hurst knows other professors might have. Now he runs his writing through two different checkers before submitting anything.
Hurst is excited about AI-driven innovation and is glad to be part of a generation that gets to experience it, but the lack of consensus over acceptable AI use and the threats posed by faulty detectors make him shake his head.
“Students,” he said, “are the ones who are caught in the middle.”
The Center for Democracy & Technology, a D.C.-based nonprofit focused on research and advocacy around digital rights, surveyed high schoolers about their experiences with a range of educational technologies last summer. At the request of The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, researchers asked students whether they or anyone they know had been wrongly accused of using generative AI to cheat. One in five said yes.
When Common Sense Media surveyed a nationally representative group of teenagers about their AI use last year, it found that Black teens were twice as likely as white and Latino teens to say their teachers had flagged their work as AI-generated when it wasn’t. In their report about the survey, researchers attributed this difference, in part, to teachers’ bias. Black students have long been disciplined at far higher rates than their peers. 
Other researchers have pointed to the vulnerability of non-native English speakers subjected to these detectors because their writing is likely to use simpler syntax and a more limited vocabulary, which happens to be typical of AI-generated writing.
Nilka Desiree Abbas suspects that’s why she was accused in the summer of 2023. A native Spanish speaker, she was taking a political science course at San Bernardino Valley College and got a zero on an assignment along with a curt message from her professor saying she had used ChatGPT. But Abbas, who is from Puerto Rico, said she hadn’t.
“It took me so long to go back to school,” she said with a toddler at her side. “To be falsely accused felt devastating.” She ultimately passed the class with a B and graduated with a degree in administration of justice the following spring, but she was shaken. She took photos of her progress on assignments in her remaining courses to create an evidence trail of original work.
Turnitin has since fine-tuned its detector to avoid accusing non-native English speakers more often than native English speakers, but it acknowledges its detector still gets it wrong sometimes. And stories like Abbas’s have saturated Reddit communities and TikTok feeds, creating anxiety even among students who don’t think they cross any academic integrity lines while completing their assignments.
CalMatters and The Markup spoke with more than a dozen current undergrads, and virtually all of them described strategies to reduce the likelihood of being wrongly accused. A freshman said she adds typos to her writing to distinguish it from AI’s. Many students said they check their papers with Turnitin before submitting them, when professors allow it, and with additional online detectors for good measure. This step has become a form of due diligence for students, most of whom describe at least some level of concern that they could be accused without having done anything wrong.
Jasmine Ruys, who oversees student conduct cases at College of the Canyons, said she often sees students who think they were wrongly accused but unwittingly used AI.
“There are students who go to other colleges where that college purchases Grammarly, the pro version, installs it on their computers to help them and when they turn it in to our instructors, it gets caught by the AI detector,” Ruys said. “It’s hard because students think they’re doing the right thing and they’re getting caught up in it because [AI] is just embedded in everything.”
The illusion of a solution
Turnitin’s original text-matching software wasn’t especially sophisticated at detecting actual plagiarism, but at least it could point to the original source behind its accusations, and a faculty member had something to assess; they could ignore the text Turnitin highlighted because students were quoting reading material or citing an appropriate source. The AI detector determines what portion of an assignment was probably generated by AI but leaves it to faculty members to puzzle through whether that AI-like text represents a violation of academic integrity.
Adam Kaiserman has taught English at College of the Canyons for more than a decade. Unlike some of his colleagues who forgo Turnitin’s technology, he looks closely at the software’s similarity reports. And while he said he plans to keep using the tool, he didn’t describe it as very helpful. Student habits have shifted. Both Kaiserman and Ruys said they almost never see traditional plagiarism in Turnitin’s text matches anymore; students who are inclined to cut corners will just use AI chatbots instead. And the software misses much of the AI-generated writing it scans, in part because Turnitin has become more conservative about what it flags to avoid accusing honest students. The software also doesn’t scan for content accuracy, leaving a key tell of AI writing undetected.

“The biggest tipoff [of AI use] are fake quotes or hallucinations, which Turnitin isn’t good at catching,” Kaiserman said. When a paper mentions a person who doesn’t exist or a quote that never appeared in the reading, what many refer to as “hallucinations,” Turnitin has no idea. It just measures how much the writing mirrors the style of AI-written text.
While many students are as honest as ever, plenty have started to use AI. They describe using ChatGPT on assignments they don’t care about, reserving their full effort for papers they see as a higher priority. Sometimes they outsource deeper thinking and planning to AI when they are stumped by a blank page and want help with how to write an introduction or structure a paper. In the Common Sense Media survey, 63% of teens said they had used a chatbot or text generator for school assignments.
Now, many colleges make chatbots available to students for free, driving even wider use. A survey of undergraduates in the United Kingdom this past December found 88% had used AI on assignments, mostly to explain concepts, summarize content and suggest research ideas, but 18% of those surveyed said they had submitted work that included some AI-generated text.
At College of the Canyons, Ruys has found that when students do use a chatbot to complete a paper, it’s usually because they had too much on their plate with school, they were preoccupied with work or family commitments or they didn’t understand the assignment. Instead of going to their professors, they went to AI. During academic-dishonesty hearings, she guides students to campus resources that can help them better manage their workloads. But she considers a lot of AI use to be in an ethical gray area, including when students write a first draft themselves and then polish it with an AI tool.
“Isn’t that very similar to our tutors?” Ruys mused.
Administrators from the California State University Office of the Chancellor, Cal State Northridge and the Los Angeles Community College District, all of whom occasionally teach, said they don’t use Turnitin in their own courses, even if they defend their institutions’ software licenses more broadly. Stanford University doesn’t license the technology at all, advising its faculty that the tools can erode feelings of trust and belonging among students and raise questions about their privacy and intellectual-property rights. 
Stommel, the University of Denver professor, said faculty members often believe cheating is on the rise and that detectors are one of the only ways to keep students honest. But he shares evidence that cheating rates have long remained largely flat, even post-ChatGPT. He also pans the use of Turnitin as a scare tactic. “We see this with the criminal-justice system,” he said. “Deterrence doesn’t actually work.” What does work, he argues, is building trusting relationships with students. “Turnitin immediately fractures that relationship with students.”
Sean Michael Morris, a frequent co-author of Stommel’s and a longtime educator, also tries to convince faculty members they don’t need Turnitin despite the company’s marketing, which champions its value to academic integrity.
“Ed tech does a good job of convincing you that it is huge, permanent, there, 100% necessary for education,” he said. “That’s its big lie.”

Here's how it hurts us all.","In immigrant-rich Westlake in Los Angeles, stores were empty Friday morning. The computer repair place was closed. 
Gates were down in front of a check-cashing operation. One of the area health clinics, where residents often line up for medical care, was open but without takers.
A block away, MacArthur Park still stirred with drug addicts and unhoused men. Police arrested two, cuffing them as the men stared into the distance. 
Around Los Angeles, flower sellers who congregate outside Forest Lawn were missing, buses were running half empty, car washes were closed. Parking lots at Home Depots and garden stores were suddenly noticeably vacant.
This is what happens when the federal government, against the wishes of those who live in a community, exercises its distant authority and imposes a solution Los Angeles residents don’t want. Confrontations in a small area of downtown escalated after the arrival of the National Guard and then of active-duty U.S. Marines. 
And Los Angeles’ large, productive, and now very afraid community of undocumented immigrants has slipped into the shadows. 
There are many misconceptions about immigrants in Los Angeles, but none more disorienting than the canard — so popular among Trump administration representatives — that those immigrants who arrived without papers somehow live apart from the rest of the city.
The role of these immigrants in the local economy is widely misunderstood and deliberately misrepresented. Undocumented immigrants do not work outside the larger economy; they are integrated into it, just as they are into every other aspect of life in California. 
When they are removed or are cowered into staying home, the effects touch everyone.
“The impact on the economy is broader,” said Saba Waheed, director of UCLA’s Labor Center. “They (federal authorities) are uprooting and interfering in the daily life of Los Angeles.
“You’re taking away part of our workforce. That is hurting LA more broadly.”
That’s in part because of the close integration of illegal immigrants into the broader economy, and not just in Los Angeles. In California, undocumented workers make up about a quarter of all farm laborers and construction workers.
When Arizona adopted anti-immigrant laws in the early 2000s, many undocumented residents, perhaps as many as 40%, left. The economy suffered. And unemployment for low-skilled white men increased, not decreased.
That makes perfect sense to all but the closed-minded or hard-hearted.

Whether here legally or illegally, these are working men and women. When they get paid, they spend that money on clothes and places to live, toys for their children, food and the stuff of life. That spending goes into the broader economy, supporting businesses that are owned and operated by legal residents. 
Restaurants and stores that depend on business from those in the country illegally suffer right along with those immigrants.
Trump supporters, starting with the president’s shrill emissary, Stephen Miller, like to counter with crocodile tears for illegal immigrants, who they suggest are an exploited class of workers, while simultaneously calling them an ominous criminal threat. 
And though it is certainly true that some undocumented residents are paid lower wages than citizens, many are not victims but have been comfortably working for years. Indeed, nearly 80% of those living illegally in this country have been working here for more than a decade.
Miller and his fellow travelers suggest that this is all a drag on the economy, a burdensome expense. But that, too, is false. 
In addition to the economic activity they generate, undocumented workers pay taxes — using taxpayer identification numbers, many pay federal income taxes. Others share housing, often with documented family members, and help pay property taxes. 

Many of these workers have Social Security money withdrawn from their paychecks but, since they are using fake Social Security numbers, they never get the benefits at the other end — which means they help prop up that system for others. 
And, of course, they pay sales taxes, which are especially vital to local governments. 
California’s undocumented workers contribute $23 billion a year in federal, state and local taxes. Their direct pay alone amounts to 5% of the state’s economy, a new study shows.
Pulling them out of the workforce, either to send them out of the country or chasing them indoors to avoid detection, hurts not just them. It hurts Los Angeles.
In fact, if deportation enthusiasts got their fondest wish, it would hurt the entire country.
One study concluded that if the government succeeds in deporting every person currently in the country illegally, it would result in a 1.4% drop in Gross Domestic Product in the first year, with losses rising thereafter. The economy would shed more than $5 trillion. 
Those are studies. And then there is life in the city. 
Los Angeles, like any city, would welcome the removal of dangerous people. But that’s not who’s being grabbed. Immigrants in the country illegally tend to be more law-abiding once here than native-born Americans.

Under Trump, more than 70% of those seized in these disruptive raids have no criminal record at all, and many more have only minor traffic or other offenses. All told, about 8% of those snatched by ICE in recent months have serious criminal histories. 
That means more than 9 out of 10 gave no evidence of being a threat. Removing them separates families, devastates businesses and damages the larger economy — with no corresponding benefit to the safety of this community. 
You don’t snag criminals by raiding car washes and Home Depot parking lots. Washington may not get that — or may not care. But Los Angeles does. 
If those who are behind the recent immigration raids imagined that they were excising an unwanted, detached community from the rest of Los Angeles, they badly miscalculated. Instead, this region has demonstrated resolve and solidarity in the face of a threat that is not just economic but cultural as well.

Churches with large immigrant congregations are advising their parishioners to stay home rather than expose themselves to ICE. Hotels and businesses are flying Mexican flags in solidarity with their workers. 
Activists and everyday people are refusing to cooperate when masked agents, who themselves refuse to provide identification, demand it of others, often merely because of their skin color. 
The city of Pasadena, hardly a hotbed of radicalism, cancelled summer swim and park programs last weekend for fear that ICE would use them to snag suspects. 
Those actions prove a point: These immigrants, however they arrived or whatever their legal status, are integral to this region’s economy and to its sense of self. 
These are our neighbors, our friends, the friends of our children, our coworkers. Forcibly removing them is bad for them, of course. It’s also bad for the rest of us.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/070119-Immigrant-Rights-Protest-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420
,California,2025-06-26 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Congress is fighting over this tax deduction. Here’s how it affects Californians,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/06/salt-deduction-taxes-california/,"The House wants to raise the SALT deduction cap, which would help wealthy Californians pay less in federal taxes. The Senate wants to keep it where it is.","In summary
The House wants to raise the SALT deduction cap, which would help wealthy Californians pay less in federal taxes. The Senate wants to keep it where it is.


A provision in the Republicans’ tax and spending bill will help determine a limit on what high-income Californians can deduct on their taxes, but Congress disagrees on how much. 
After the passage of the 2017 tax bill during President Donald Trump’s first term, California taxpayers who itemize deductions saw their ability to deduct their full state and local income taxes and property taxes go away — to help the federal government pay for corporate tax cuts. The new cap that was established, $10,000, expires at the end of this year.   
Now the tax bill in the U.S. House of Representatives proposes raising the deduction’s cap to $40,000, though the U.S. Senate bill would keep the cap where it is. 
The debate over raising the so-called SALT (state and local taxes) deduction cap has been contentious. A higher cap would benefit high-income people who many experts say don’t need another tax break. But another part of the proposal would get rid of a workaround that individuals and small business owners have been using to reduce their personal income tax. 
Nikhita Airi, a research associate in the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, wrote in an analysis that raising the cap “would be expensive and deliver little benefit to most taxpayers.” Nationally, about 10% of taxpayers who itemize use the state and local tax deduction, she told CalMatters.
That number is higher In California, where about 2.8 million taxpayers, or 15% of those who filed taxes in the state, claimed the deduction in 2022, according to the most recent data available from the IRS. The highest percentage of those who used the deductions were in some of the wealthiest parts of the state, such as Marin, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, according to Airi’s analysis.  
While some experts agree with the sentiment that raising the cap would benefit mostly wealthy taxpayers, it would actually help “the working rich” in high-cost California, said Dennis Ventry, a professor at UC Davis School of Law who focuses on tax policy.
Ventry was referring to people whose annual income is between $250,000 and right under $500,000, who are likely to itemize their deductions. 
For example, raising the cap could mean California residents could deduct the full cost of their property taxes, he said. The median price of a home in the state is $900,000. Although it varies by county, the property tax for such a home would be about $9,000 annually. Raising the deduction cap would allow many homeowners to deduct their property taxes as well as other state and local taxes.
“That’s a big deal,” Ventry said. “Or it pays for your child care so your spouse can re-enter the workforce.”
The House proposal would allow the increased cap to apply to those with annual incomes of $500,000 or less. Taxpayers who make more would be subject to the $10,000 cap.
More than 20 California Democrats in the House, led by U.S. Reps. Dave Min of Costa Mesa, Zoe Lofgren of San Jose and Mike Thompson of Napa, actually pushed for no cap on the deduction. They wrote in a May letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith that the state’s taxpayers “pay more than their fair share of taxes to our nation and deserve tax relief in these difficult economic times.” 
Rep. Young Kim of Anaheim, a Republican member of Congress, was pushing for a $62,000 deduction limit, advocating for a higher cap along with her colleagues from other high-tax states such as New York and New Jersey. Kim represents parts of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, where almost half of homes are worth more than $1 million.
It’s no surprise that the Senate kept the cap at $10,000. “There is no Republican senator from a high-tax state,” said Alan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at UC Berkeley. “If the Senate had a choice, it would not include this provision.”
Another part of the proposed tax bills would partly get rid of workarounds that certain taxpayers have been using: By paying state taxes through a business entity, owners can effectively bypass the federal deduction cap and count the payments toward their personal state income taxes.
Without the workaround, individuals and small businesses with incomes under $500,000 — such as doctors with private practices or lawyers or financial professionals with their own firms — could be subject to whatever deduction cap Congress eventually agrees on. But, as authors of an analysis by the Tax Law Center at the New York University School of Law wrote, the House bill included exceptions to shutting down the workaround, depending on the types of taxes being paid. 
Darien Shanske, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law who focuses on state and local taxation, said that the discussion about these tax proposals can “make it hard to give a straight answer… it clearly skews toward wealthier people.”
In the case of getting rid of the cap workaround, for example, Shanske said it would be more palatable if, say, “they were doing it to fund universal pre-K.” But he said “this is being done to retain low taxes on [big] corporations. You’re increasing taxes on smaller businesses. That’s problematic.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/040123-Tax-File-Preparation-PU-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420

Their unions are fighting substitutes,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/california-court-reporter-shortage/,A shortage of court reporters is leaving many Califonians with no way to appeal their cases in the justice system. Will a new union-backed bill solve the problem or make it worse?,"In summary
A shortage of court reporters is leaving many Califonians with no way to appeal their cases in the justice system. Will a new union-backed bill solve the problem or make it worse?


Ashley Paschen believed she had a strong case as she sought a restraining order against her ex-husband.
She alleges she had proof he hurt her, and she had “nanny camera” footage that she alleges showed him beating her stepson. But a San Diego County court commissioner refused to admit the video footage as evidence and ruled that her abuse claims weren’t credible. 
She wanted to appeal the decision, but no attorney would represent her because no one transcribed her court hearings. Court reporters simply weren’t available for all of her court dates. Without a written record “it makes it virtually impossible to win an appeal,” one attorney told her.
It’s a common occurrence in California. Since 2023, more than 1.7 million family law, restraining order, probate and other civil proceedings have had no written transcriptions, according to the Judicial Branch of California. 
That’s because there’s a statewide shortage of certified court reporters. When no reporters are available, state law, with a few exceptions, bans recording in courtrooms, even though many courts have recording devices. Having a recording would give parties in a legal dispute the option of later having a hearing transcribed by a certified professional. 
“It’s absolutely outraging (if) it’s that easy to, you know, flip a switch and be able to record,”  Paschen said. 
Nonprofit legal aid groups filed a petition late last year urging the California Supreme Court to overturn a ban on recording cases such as Paschen’s.
The petitioners argue that Californians’ constitutional rights to appeal are being violated, and the ban on recording in courtrooms creates a “two-tiered” system of justice. Wealthy litigants, the petitioners say, have the option of hiring private court reporters to sit in on their hearings and type up a written record. But people who can’t afford the more than $3,000 a day to hire a contract reporter are at the mercy of an understaffed court system.
Most states and the federal courts use recording technology more than California does, some exclusively in lieu of court reporters. Only Texas and New York restrict the technology to the extent California does, according to the Judicial Council of California.
Now, with the state Supreme Court’s ruling pending, the unions representing court reporters have urged the court to uphold the recording  ban. At the same time, the union is pushing for legislation that will temporarily allow recording in cases like Paschen’s. If it passes, it could conflict with the court’s decision.
And critics say the union’s bill might make the problem worse.
Influential SEIU pushes for bill
San Mateo Democratic Assemblymember Diane Papan’s Assembly Bill 882 would lift the ban on recording in civil cases for three years to give the courts time to hire more reporters and ease the shortage.
“This bill is about access to justice,” Papan told her colleagues on the Assembly floor early this month. “It will ensure that a record of civil proceedings is available when a litigant cannot afford to hire a court reporter.” 
Papan didn’t return interview requests; neither did a lobbying representative for the most influential labor organization behind the bill, Service Employees International Union. SEIU has donated at least $62,300 to Papan since 2021, according to the CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.
Critics say unions put so many restrictions into Papan’s measure that it doesn’t go nearly far enough to solve the problem – and could even make it harder to turn on a recorder inside a courtroom. 
The proposal would require parties in a case who cannot afford to retain a private court reporter to request in writing a recording at least a day before a hearing, an option that those without an attorney are unlikely to know about. 
Court reporters also could turn down an assignment in another courtroom, even if it’s in the same building. For instance, a court reporter stationed in a family courtroom would not be required to cover a felony criminal trial, even if the lack of a court reporter would cause the case to be dismissed.

Earlier versions of the bill, which easily passed the Assembly this month, had more restrictions, including prohibiting courts from buying or leasing recording equipment.
Unions that represent court reporters that got the ban on court recording passed in the first place have fought previous legislative efforts to expand use of the technology. In 2023, the unions succeeded in killing the bill which would have allowed recording in all civil proceedings. 
Had it passed, the legal aid groups wouldn’t have needed to ask the California Supreme Court to decide the matter. In a brief opposing the pending Supreme Court case, SEIU and other court reporter unions argued the Supreme Court wasn’t the appropriate venue and that the Legislature and trial courts are working to solve the problem.
The court reporter dispute is the latest example of the political power labor unions wield in the Legislature. 
As CalMatters has reported, organized labor, which represents around one-sixth of the state’s workforce, regularly gets its way on bills at higher rates than other prolific lobbying groups, due in part to the massive political spending by unions. 
SEIU is one of the most politically influential unions. Since 2015, SEIU and its affiliates have donated at least $20.6 million to members of the Legislature, according to the Digital Democracy database.
“The union representing court reporters has been a particularly effective union in protecting their interests,” said Clark Kelso, a professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law.
Despite good pay, positions go unfilled
Court reporters argue that because they guarantee that their transcriptions are 100% accurate, they’re the only method of ensuring no one loses a case because something said during a hearing is written down wrong.
Court reporters can ask a witness to speak up, slow down or repeat their words if they’re hard to understand. Without human beings doing that, transcriptions can end up incomplete or inaccurate, the bill’s proponents say. 
“The state of California demands justice be fair and accurate,” Stacy Gaskill, a court reporter from San Mateo County, told the Assembly Judiciary Committee in April. “That can only be met if court records are verbatim and complete.” She said court reporters are held to such high standards they can be charged with a crime for certifying inaccurate transcripts.  
While most agree that human court reporters are the gold standard, those pushing for expanded recording in courtrooms argue that there aren’t enough new court reporters to offset the number of retiring workers – a problem causing ripple effects throughout the judicial system. Around 4,600 court reporters are licensed in California, most of them not court employees. That’s down from 7,500 in 2010. Around half of them were eligible for retirement in 2023, according to the last available statistic from the judicial branch.

The most serious cases, such as felony criminal proceedings, get priority for a court reporter, leaving other hearings without a written record on busy days. Almost all of California’s major civil cases go without one; more than half of all family law and probate cases have no reporter present, according to the judicial branch.
“The inability to create a verbatim record limits people’s ability to appeal significant and life-changing decisions regarding child custody, paternity, conservatorship assets, and more,” the judicial branch says on its website.
Legal organizations that filed the petition with the Supreme Court say it’s often not known whether reporters are available until the day of the hearing. This forces attorneys and their clients to decide to delay their cases or risk that they won’t need a written record during an appeal.
“Even when a continuance is a viable choice, it may be repeated, dragging out proceedings for many months or even years,” the aid group, BayLegal, wrote in the petition.
The shortage comes despite the Legislature’s approval of $30 million to lure new hires for the well-paying job. 
The median pay with benefits for a court reporter in California is more than $200,000, according to the judicial branch. Plus, by law, transcripts of hearings must be purchased from court reporters who get to keep the money. During the last fiscal year, California courts spent $23.7 million paying court reporters for transcripts, according to the judicial branch. 
But even with the job’s financial perks, courts are struggling to hire. Los Angeles Superior Court is offering a $50,000 signing bonus and $25,000 finder’s fee for court employees who refer a court reporter. Despite the incentives, L.A. County has 106 vacant court reporter positions, according to an online dashboard the superior court created to highlight the problem.
Hiring has stepped up statewide, but courts still need an estimated 428 new full-time court reporters to catch up, according to a statewide dashboard.  
Could AI replace court reporters?
It’s hardly surprising that courts are struggling to find enough reporters, said Lorin Kline, director of advocacy for the Legal Aid Association of California, one of the groups pushing for expanding the use of recordings in courtrooms.

Kline said court reporters are likely to make more money working as private contractors, and younger applicants may recognize that artificial intelligence transcription technology could replace their jobs in a few years. 
“Not only is it a profession with potentially a questionable future because of technology,” Kline said, “working in the court itself isn’t necessarily the first job that a court reporter wants to get because they can make more money working elsewhere.”
Neither the petition before the Supreme Court nor the bill to temporarily allow more recordings refer to AI transcription software. For now and the immediate future, to appeal a case, a transcript from a recorded hearing must be prepared by a pro. 
Some experts say AI is not the answer to the court reporter shortage — and will never be.
“Humans just do language imperfectly all the time and in unpredictable ways… and they make mistakes,” said Nicole Holliday, an associate professor of linguistics at UC Berkeley.  “But here’s where they have the edge over any automated system: They can pause and ask for clarifications. They can improve their training.”
She said AI transcription systems have been trained to transcribe speech based on how English is spoken by a subset of the population that’s typically white and wealthy. The software is not even close to accurate for the diverse accents spoken in America today, Holliday said.
Others see promise as the technology improves and if it’s deployed responsibly, including Camille Crittenden, executive director of UC Berkeley’s Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society and the Banatao Institute.
She called the technology “potentially transformative for the judicial system,” giving poor people the same access to justice while achieving “all kinds of cost savings.”
“I know that the union doesn’t want to hear that,” she said. “But for the courts overall, that would seem like a positive outcome.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/10092023_CARE-Court_AH_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420
,California,2025-06-26 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Turnitin charged some California colleges 3 times more for the same plagiarism detector,Tara García Mathewson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/06/plagiarism-detector-california/,Experts say companies often base their pricing on what they think colleges are willing to pay.,"In summary
Experts say companies often base their pricing on what they think colleges are willing to pay. 



If a California community college wants its faculty to be able to detect plagiarism and AI writing in student papers, it can buy software from a company called Turnitin at a discounted price. By banding together through the Community College League of California, each campus gets the purchasing power of the collective. Yet even though the league has more than four times as many colleges as the California State University system, its members pay more per student for Turnitin’s software.
And the Cal State system pays more than the University of California at Berkeley.
And UC Berkeley pays more than the City University of New York.
As part of an investigation into the consequences of this software’s use in higher education, CalMatters and The Markup collected purchasing records from approximately 60 California institutions as well as the CUNY system through public records requests. This investigation chronicles the dominance of Turnitin, which continues to collect millions of dollars every year from California colleges and universities despite its unsophisticated technology and its demand for a perpetual license to the student work it scans.
In reviewing records across California, CalMatters and The Markup also discovered wide variation in the amount Turnitin charged for its plagiarism-prevention tools, even when colleges were licensing the same product. While Turnitin did not respond to interview requests seeking information about its pricing strategy, experts said companies charge different amounts to different institutions based on how much they expect the institutions are willing to pay.
In 2020, Michel Davidoff retired as chief infrastructure officer in the California State University chancellor’s office, where he helped centralize technology purchases to secure huge discounts. When presented with the results of the CalMatters-Markup investigation into Turnitin pricing, Davidoff was not surprised. He said the size and reputation of an institution routinely sway the price of a given product.
“When Berkeley wants to negotiate pricing,” Davidoff said, “everyone wants the Berkeley logo on the website, knowing they bought it.”
Small colleges with little name recognition, then, get the worst deals. “They don’t have much money, they don’t have [many] students, and they’re paying the most,” he said.
The most extreme example of this variation came in records showing how much campuses paid during the 2021-22 school year. Turnitin had been flooded with customers the prior year when the Covid pandemic shut down campuses and instructors worried they couldn’t trust students at home. That year, UC Berkeley paid $2.11 per student for its Turnitin license. Cal State Long Beach and Antelope Valley College each paid $3.03 per student for the same product, records show. And the UC Irvine Division of Continuing Education paid more than double that, $6.50 per student.
Yet on the other side of the country, CUNY’s purchasing records show that the 200,000-student system got the best deal of all, paying just $1.79 per pupil for the same technology.

Davidoff, for his part, was pained to hear CUNY got a better deal than the Cal State system.
“CUNY? I’m crushed,” he said with a laugh.
Colleges tend to put out a “request for proposals” when they want to make institutional purchases. Companies then submit bids outlining the products they have, their capabilities, and the price. The Cal State system does not let companies charge significantly less than it costs to provide a product, but it otherwise encourages companies to give it the best deal they can.
The system last signed a contract with Turnitin in March of 2024, locking in the company’s basic plagiarism detector for $2.59 per student last year and $2.71 per student this year. For colleges to add the AI upgrade, Turnitin first offered institutions a total cost of $3.05 and $3.19 per student, respectively. Only six campuses took them up on the upgrade offer. But negotiations continued.
Leslie Kennedy, assistant vice chancellor of academic technology services for the Cal State Office of the Chancellor, reached out to her contact at Turnitin, saying there was demand for the detectors across the Cal State system, but that campuses couldn’t handle the cost.
“Turnitin came back to me and said, ‘We can give you better pricing if you buy for the whole system,’” Kennedy said. The company may have lost potential profits in discounting the AI detector for individual campuses, but it guaranteed itself more business. When Turnitin offered an additional 13% discount on top of the deal Cal State already had, Kennedy agreed to pay about $100,200 from her budget in the chancellor’s office to make it happen. And now 16 more campuses have access to the AI detector at a discounted price of $3.12 per student instead of $3.19.
Meanwhile, South Orange County Community College District is paying $3.57 per student for the same product this year.
While the per-student price for Turnitin sounds small, the cost adds up. The Cal State system has collectively spent over $6 million on this plagiarism-prevention technology in the last seven years. And UC Berkeley is in the middle of a 10-year, $1.2-million contract of its own.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the changes could cause nearly 9 million Americans to lose health care coverage. That includes approximately 130,000 to 160,000 annually in Missouri, said Sheldon Weisgrau, vice president of health policy and advocacy at the Missouri Foundation for Health, during a news briefing on Wednesday.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” proposes individuals ages 19 to 64 would need to work at least 80 hours per month to be eligible for Medicaid coverage unless they qualify for an exemption. These exemptions include, but aren’t limited to, people with disabilities, people taking care of dependent children and people who are pregnant.
Atate Sen. Patty Lewis, a Kansas City Democrat, described the bill as “devastating.”
Missouri’s Medicaid program, known as MO HealthNet, currently serves approximately 1.25 million people. This includes 660,000 children, 109,000 seniors and 186,000 people with disabilities, according to a joint news release from Lewis and the Missouri Foundation of Health.
Missouri receives $12.7 billion in federal funds from the program, and nearly two-thirds of the state’s Medicaid budget is made up of federal funding. The bill being considered by Congress would also introduce new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and scale back federal funding by an estimated $1.3 trillion over the next decade.
“Patients going through cancer treatment, going through chemo and radiation, who are immunocompromised, could be forced to be out in the community, working when that would be ill advised by their health care providers,” Lewis said.
Missouri has already seen 21 hospital closures since 2014, and another 25 are currently at risk as the proposed legislation moves through Congress. Weisgrau said rural providers could lose up to 21 cents of every Medicaid dollar under the bill.
Weisgrau said these hospitals are the largest or second-largest source of income for rural counties, so the cuts will affect income and lead to job loss if implemented.
“We are likely going to see rural hospitals close,” Weisgrau said. “That means job losses and economic ripple effects.”
MU Health Care and Boone Health are two of the largest hospital systems serving patients across mid-Missouri. Officials say that while the impact is unknown at this time, they are actively watching the legislation.
“This bill is unpopular and will harm and kill people if implemented,” Lewis said. “It’s vital that Missourians contact their representatives now.”

(Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)Heading into the momentous 2023 legislative session, then-House Speaker Melissa Hortman was dealing with big, fractious and ideologically diverse personalities in her caucus.
“Dave Lislegard and I had been in a hot war with each other for two years,” said Rep. Aisha Gomez, a Minneapolis Democrat with punk rock tastes and socialist politics.
Lislegard is a self-described “Iron Range old-school Democrat.” 
Hortman’s plan was to have them take the lead on taxes, which would be an important policy lever as Democrats sought to spread Minnesota’s prosperity more widely. 
“I didn’t know how it would work out,” Lislegard said in an email.
Hortman persisted: “You guys are closer than you think,” she told Lislegard.
The result was a massive tax bill that created a steeply graduated child tax credit, among other progressive achievements. 
“Melissa saw what no one else did,” Lislegard said. “She had an ability to see what’s in people’s hearts and how we could take the best parts from our own unique backgrounds to build a partnership.”
Gomez and Lislegard say Hortman’s matchmaking fostered both a tax bill — and a lifelong friendship. But Hortman wasn’t doing it just to make friends.
It was a “totally shrewd move,” Gomez said, cementing the loyalty of the farthest right and left flanks of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor House caucus, which was key to securing the votes Hortman needed to pass Minnesota’s most ambitious legislative agenda in decades.
Hortman’s politically motivated assassination this month has left Lislegard and Gomez – and the entire state – in shock and grief.
“She was an amazing friend,” Lislegard said, “and I already miss her terribly.” 
The Reformer interviewed nearly two dozen legislators of both parties, Capitol staff, political operatives, and the many Hortman alums who have gone on to successful careers in business, law and public service thanks to her mentoring.
The portrait that emerges is of an unusual politician: She merely tolerated the spotlight, happily shared credit and accepted blame, eschewed higher office, and by all accounts was motivated chiefly by an interest in public policy, its details and how it could help as many Minnesotans as possible. 
Hortman, a Catholic Sunday school teacher, was also guided by an insight often lost on elected officials. 
“Selflessness enhances power. Strong leaders understand that,” said Larry Redmond, a DFL lobbyist whose political resume includes working as a political aide to Hubert Humphrey. 
Put another way, “She wasn’t about the bullshit,” Gomez said. “The TV cameras or the next higher public office. Or about being glorified or having everyone like you. She was about doing the best she could do for the most people.” 
On Friday, June 26, she will be the first woman in Minnesota history to lie in state at the Capitol, along with her husband Mark Hortman and their golden retriever, Gilbert.

Losses and reused yard signs 
Hortman began her own political career by losing — twice, in 1998 and again in 2002. 
“Adversity is a good teacher,” Redmond said.
From those defeats and her time representing a swing district, Hortman learned the importance of maintaining contact with voters, especially by knocking doors — thousands of them. Years later, as a caucus leader, she also never forgot what it was like to defend a battleground.  
In 2004, she hired future DFL Rep. Zack Stephenson as her campaign manager as an early 20s college student with no political experience in what would become another pattern: nurturing talent.
Hortman’s lawn signs in 2004 said “It’s time to get the job done” and made the pitch that unlike the incumbent, she would get the north metro a fair share of road and bridge money.
She won by a few hundred votes in the same year Republican President George W. Bush won her district.
When she ran for reelection in 2006, she was worried about reusing the slogan “It’s time to get the job done,” because she was now the one doing the job.
“Melissa was frugal and really hated waste, so she didn’t get new lawn signs. She just cut the (old slogan) off all the lawn signs, hundreds of them,” Stephenson said.
A wonky policy profile with roots in environmentalism
Growing up, Hortman’s family owned a junkyard, and she prided herself on understanding blue-collar small business people, but she’d also been educated at Boston University and the University of Minnesota Law School. 
She took up the wonkiest of subjects: Energy law and what was then only just emerging as a major policy issue — climate change. 
She fought against the powerful auto dealers’ lobby — and some in her own caucus — in a seemingly quixotic battle to adopt stricter tailpipe emissions standards, which would come to fruition more than a decade later when Gov. Tim Walz used rulemaking to adopt the standards. 
In 2007, she played a role in passing a mandate for Minnesota utilities to generate 25% to 30% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025, an optimistic target at the time which the state reached early. 
She was also author of a landmark 2013 law that set solar energy standards for Minnesota utilities and kickstarted what was for several years the country’s leading community solar program.
“We called her the godmother of solar in Minnesota,” said Logan O’Grady, executive director of the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association.
When then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty vetoed a transportation bill after the I-35 bridge collapse, Democrats appointed her the chief spokesperson during the floor debate over overriding the Republican governor’s veto. 
“Here is someone in their second term and is being called upon to navigate what was probably the most significant floor debate of that decade,” said former DFL Rep. Frank Hornstein. “We prevailed, and it felt like winning the Super Bowl.” 
Later, she’d become known as a legislative fixer who could pick up an ailing piece of legislation and yank it across the finish line, as with a foreclosure reform bill in the wake of the housing crisis of the Great Recession. (Fresh out of law school years before, she’d worked for Central Minnesota Legal Services, where she won a then-record-setting verdict in a housing discrimination lawsuit.)

While her interest remained policy, Hortman was developing a theory of elections, politics and power. 
Democrats would wind up losing the majority during the 2010 Republican wave that swept all the way to Washington, and Hortman often relayed what a voter told her that year: He didn’t care what she had done in the Legislature. He was sending a message to Democrats.
This humbling moment was so seared in her brain that she would repeat it to legions of legislators and operatives over the years: Voters mostly don’t know who their legislator is, and they care even less. 
The national political atmosphere will determine the outcome of most elections. 
Within those constraints, however, candidates could eke out enough votes on the margins to win the close races that frequently determined control of the House. 
And the best way to do that was by knocking doors and having face-to-face interactions that voters would appreciate and remember. 
Later, as caucus leader, she kept a tally of the members’ door knocking stats and sent out an email with everyone’s scores, including her own. The message was clear: If you want a good committee gavel, you need to do the work. After a doorknocking session, known as “Speaker knocks,” they’d retreat to a local bar for fellowship. 
The doorknocking also informed governing, as the conversations helped Democrats create an agenda that people wanted. 
Her approach to power was similarly grounded in the knowledge that it was fleeting. 
When Democrats controlled both chambers of the Legislature and the governor’s office in 2013-14, they debated how boldly they should govern, with an eye on the 2014 midterm election. 
On issues like a gas tax increase for transportation, drivers licenses for undocumented people and restoring ex-felons’ right to vote, some Democrats wanted to play it safe.
Lars Negstad, the policy director for the progressive ecumenical group ISAIAH, said Hortman made the kind of blunt argument she was famous for in an environment more often known for Scandinavian reticence. 
“We’re gonna lose anyway. We should just do it,” Negstad recalls her saying, anticipating the go-for-broke 2023 legislative session a decade later, when Democrats passed all three of those policies. 
An underestimated minority leader
Hortman became the House DFL leader in 2017 at a perilous moment for the DFL. Republicans had defied political gravity and picked up House seats in 2016 while taking control of the state Senate. Democrats feared Minnesota would go the way of Scott Walker’s Wisconsin, with its gerrymandered, permanent GOP majorities and attack on collective bargaining rights. 
She immediately made the kinds of sweeping changes that would become her management hallmark.
Brynn Hausz, who worked for Hortman in those years and is now intergovernmental relations director for St. Paul, recalled that a woman DFL legislator warned about “the optics” of Hortman’s all-female staff. 
Hortman replied, “I don’t remember anyone complaining when the leadership team was all men.”
In another instance, Hortman defended Hausz when a member of the caucus tried to have her fired. Hortman gathered the facts, and that was the last Hausz heard of it. 
“She had my back,” Hausz said.
Susie Malmberg-Merthan, who was a media and political advisor, said Hortman worked her staff hard — though she always outworked all of them herself — modernizing and systematizing both the caucus and the campaign. 
She didn’t suffer fools, but even her famously salty, cutting remarks came with a signature twinkle in her eye, and she was equally known for small kindnesses gifted upon the dozens of people in her orbit. 
Hortman won the loyalty of her caucus and many Minnesota Democrats during a moment of spontaneous anger.

Marching on freeways had emerged as a way to protest unconstitutional policing and Black men dying at the hands of police, including Philando Castile in 2016.
Republicans sought to stiffen criminal penalties for  the highway marches. 
As Democratic women of color talked about the nation’s history of racial injustice and the nonviolent resistance of the Civil Rights movement, some Republicans left to play cards in what’s known as the retiring room off the House floor.
I.e., women were talking and the men weren’t listening.
Hortman rose and made a point of privilege.
“I hate to break up the 100% white male card game in the retiring room,” Hortman said. “But I think this is an important debate.”  
Republicans asked Hortman to apologize, but she was unfazed. 
“I’m really tired of watching women of color, in particular, being ignored,” she said. “So, I’m not sorry.”
The moment went viral, known as “Sorry, not sorry.” 
Lt. Gov. Flanagan, who was one of the women Hortman was advocating for on the House floor, said the moment felt like a first.
“I remember in that moment just being like, ‘Oh, she’s got our backs.’ And in a way that in politics I just had never experienced before,” Flanagan said. 
State Sen. Erin Maye Quade, who was in the House at the time, said that Hortman’s authenticity came through because she didn’t ask them about it beforehand. There was no strategy. 
Malmberg-Merthan said she remembers thinking, “Oh shit, there she goes.” 
Abou Amara, a former DFL House aide close to Hortman who is now an attorney, said Hortman had been quietly evolving and learning about racial justice issues as her district became among the state’s most diverse, and as policing emerged as a key issue for her constituents and caucus. 
“She was always growing in her representation of people,” he said. 
She was also raising money, recruiting candidates and knocking on doors, preparing for what she knew — having lived through the opposite scenario in 2010 — would be a good Democratic year.

A master negotiator emerges
Hortman became speaker during divided government, in what would prove to be some of the most tumultuous years in recent Minnesota history.  
She immediately made changes to improve the working conditions of members and staff. 
Unruly House debates have historically stretched into the early morning hours. 
“We all knew that eventually something bad is going to happen at 3 or 4 in the morning,” said former Rep. Pat Garofalo, a south metro Republican who served with Hortman for nearly two decades. She feared a member or staff would die in a car wreck. 
“Her thought was, ‘Rather than waiting for something horrible to happen. Why don’t we just do it now?’” Floor sessions have rarely gone past midnight ever since. 
Hortman always made sure to keep her office stocked with snacks and drinks. 
“I served under a lot of speakers, and she was the only one to make sure we were fully hydrated and ready for long floor sessions,” Hornstein said. 
When COVID-19 hit, the health and safety of the entire House and the staff became her focus. 
Longtime Chief Clerk Pat Murphy’s wife was immunocompromised, but the clerk had to be in House chambers. So, Hortman, who worked to create a system of remote voting, decreed that only people who had to be in the House chamber should be there.
Then-Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a Republican from lake country, said she was an excellent governing partner who became a friend.
“My connection to Melissa Hortman became very important to Minnesota,” said Gazelka, who compared their bond to that of soldiers of wildly different backgrounds coming together for a common purpose. 
After the police murder of George Floyd, the two worked out a compromise on policing reforms, which was a nearly impossible task given the passion of urban Democrats and the increasingly close relationship between Republicans and police. 
Neither the Democratic public safety chair in the House nor the Republican chair in the Senate wanted a bill because they were so dug in on their positions. “But by the time we hashed out what was in it, both wanted their names on it,” Gazelka said.  
It included a ban on chokeholds and the kinds of maneuvers used in the Floyd murder, while creating a duty to intercede when an officer witnesses another using excessive force. 
Negstad recalled that after a particularly grueling negotiation with Gazelka, Hortman tried to be optimistic about her differences with him: “At least he loves Jesus, so we have that in common.” 
During the years of divided government, however, Hortman was planning and preparing in case Democrats won a trifecta again: She ran ambitious bills like a new paid leave program through the gauntlet, knowing they wouldn’t even get a hearing in the GOP-controlled Senate. This way, they were vetted. Interest group allies knew the score. The opposition’s arguments were well known. When one paid leave bill author would leave the House, she’d assign another to pick it up.
A trifecta, and a historic session
After Democrats captured the Legislature in 2022, Hortman brought in Zach Rodvold, who was a key House aide during the previous trifecta, and former Dayton chief of staff Jaime Tincher, to talk to the caucus about how to use their newfound power. 
They had two messages: 
“Do as much good for as many people as possible.” 
“Do the right thing and the message will take care of itself.”
These two sentences remained on a scoreboard Hortman kept of all the bills the caucus wanted to pass. 
The result was a more ambitious legislative session than any in decades.
Democrats codified abortion rights; restored voting rights to people no longer incarcerated; allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain a drivers license; enacted a so-called red flag law to take guns from people deemed dangerous; mandated carbon-free electricity by 2040; fully legalized marijuana; and, made Minnesota a sanctuary state for trans people.
They passed one of the most significant pro-worker agendas in state history, including paid sick leave and a state-run paid family and medical leave program; banned noncompete agreements; and raised workplace safety standards at meatpacking plants and Amazon and other big warehouses.
They raised taxes in the metro for housing and transportation; they showered money on public building projects around the state and increased spending on education and human services.
To a large degree, this will be Hortman’s policy legacy, and for now, the results remain to be seen. 
The paid leave program launches Jan. 1. The marijuana market has struggled to get off the ground. The state, flush with cash just two years ago, confronts a serious fiscal imbalance, with deficits on the horizon. Population growth has remained relatively stagnant.

The toughest vote of her career, just days before her death
The voters returned a mixed verdict in 2024, sending to the House 67 Democrats and 67 Republicans. 
But the 2025 legislative session wound up starting with a temporary Republican majority, 67-66. Hortman, fearing Republicans would use the advantage to unseat a Democrat who had won a contested race, kept her caucus united in a three-week boycott. After prevailing at the state Supreme Court, she negotiated a power-sharing agreement with Republicans, including giving up the speakership to GOP leader Rep. Lisa Demuth. Later, the two would negotiate a two-year state budget. 
Demuth called Hortman a worthy adversary: “I have the utmost respect for her, even though we disagreed. She was incredibly brilliant as a politician, sometimes to my detriment.” 
As part of that budget deal, Hortman was forced to take the toughest vote of her career, ending state-subsidized health insurance for undocumented adults. She was the sole House Democrat to vote for it, upholding her end of the bargain, in exchange for keeping the government open and funding schools, safety net programs, parks and public safety and saving thousands of state workers from a damaging government shutdown.

In due time, city councils and school boards and legislators and governors will want Hortman’s name to grace the facades of community centers and schools and park buildings and roads and maybe even the newly refurbished State Office Building, a robust example of public architecture that she won in a negotiation with Gazelka. 
She would probably scoff at all that, however. 
Hortman loved gardening and wanted more trees planted on the Capitol mall. The area is relatively open with little shade and few places to sit down.
“She talked about bringing her grandchildren to sit under the shade of one of those trees on the front lawn, and that missed opportunity now is really heartbreaking,” Flanagan said. 
“We’re going plant all of the damn trees that Melissa ever wanted,” she said. “We will have trees that her grandchildren will be able to sit under and feel that clean shade and the love of a grandma they never met but is beloved by so many people in Minnesota.”

But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
Michigan is one of at least 37 states and Washington, D.C. that have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.

But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A man is dead. One man who was arrested is now out of jail. And the man who allegedly shot three bullets — including the one that killed “innocent bystander” Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo, according to police — is cooperating with law enforcement but is not in custody. 
Based on what’s been reported so far in the wake of the chaotic shooting during a “No Kings” protest in Salt Lake City earlier this month, Utah gun law experts say the tragic situation is looking increasingly legally nuanced. And they say it’s possible any justice for Ah Loo and his family may be more likely to come from a civil lawsuit than a criminal case — but that remains to be seen.
“There was, from what it sounds like, a misunderstanding, which led to extremely tragic consequences,” said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council and a Utah gun law lobbyist. 
Man arrested in connection with shooting during ‘No Kings’ protest released from jail

According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting during the June 14 protest happened after two men, who described themselves to police as “peacekeepers,” confronted 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was openly carrying an AR-15 style rifle during the protest. One of the men, reportedly part of the event organizer’s volunteer security team, told police he thought Gamboa was acting suspiciously, which led him to fire three shots from a handgun, hitting Gamboa in the back but also inadvertently striking Ah Loo, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital. 
Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle, and his attorney said his rifle was not loaded. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with investigators. 
Last week, Gamoba was released from jail after the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office conducted a preliminary review of evidence. While the investigation continues, charges have  not been filed in the case, against either Gamboa or the unnamed armed security volunteer.

While police and protest organizers have not released the identity of the security volunteer, Utah 50501 said he is a military veteran and that members of the safety team were chosen for “military, first responder, and other relevant de-escalation experience.” 
‘Peacekeeper’ involved in shooting at SLC ‘No Kings’ protest is a military veteran, organizers say

The national 50501 organization has disavowed the Utah chapter in the days following the shooting, pointing to a “strict no-weapons policy” for the groups it affiliates with. Salt Lake’s demonstration, which drew 10,000 people, was part of a national wave of protests that day criticizing President Donald Trump’s leadership and policies. 
To Aposhian, Utah’s nonrestrictive gun laws may offer protection for both Gamboa and the armed security volunteer who fired. 
“You know, my gut (feeling) is nobody’s going to be going to prison on this,” Aposhian said, adding that prosecutors likely face a “heavy bar” to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gamboa had malicious intent by openly carrying the AR-15 or was acting recklessly leading up to the shooting. 
Utah’s gun and self-defense laws and the factors at play
Utah is a “constitutional carry” state, meaning its laws allow the open and concealed carrying of firearms without a permit for those 21 years old and over who are legally allowed to possess them. Plus, those ages 18 to 20 can carry a concealed firearm in public if they obtain a provisional concealed carry permit. 
Utah also has one of the “strongest” self defense laws in the country, said Mitch Vilos, a Utah attorney with expertise in weapons law and the author of a book comparing self-defense laws across all 50 states. Utah law allows the use of force, including deadly force, when a person reasonably believes it’s necessary to prevent death, serious bodily injury, or forcible felony. Utah is also a “stand your ground” state, meaning a person does not have a duty to retreat before using force in self-defense, including in public places. 
The details that will likely decide a potential criminal case or a civil lawsuit will likely come down to two things — intent and behavior — leading up to the shooting.

“Unless there’s something that shows Gamboa … had some sort of a manifesto or something,” Vilos said, then it’s likely prosecutors won’t be able to prove any sort of malicious intent on his part. And the “No Kings” demonstration reportedly wasn’t the first protest where Gamboa has openly carried that AR-15 style rifle. His friend and longtime roommate told The Salt Lake Tribune he’s brought it to protests at least a dozen times before, and never aimed it at anyone. 
And as for the armed security volunteer, “if he reasonably thought that a mass murder was in progress” in the moments before shooting and if prosecutors can’t provide “clear and convincing evidence that (his decision to shoot) was not self-defense or self-defense or another,” then a criminal case would likely be dismissed, Vilos said. 
“You know, (it seems) you have two people with good intentions, and to me it just doesn’t seem productive to bring a criminal case against either one of them,” Vilos said. “I think it’s more of a friendly fire incident than it is a case where you’ve got someone that’s acting violently towards someone with no good cause.” 
The self-described “peacekeeper” told police, according to an affidavit of probable cause for Gamboa’s arrest, that Gamboa had “lifted the rifle,” and witnesses said he had begun running toward the crowd while holding it in a “firing position.” 
But in the days since Gamboa’s arrest, videos have circulated online raising questions about whether Gamboa had actually raised the rifle in a firing position or charged the crowd. One video angle, reported by FOX 13, showed Gamboa with his rifle pointed down and not running until after one of the security volunteers started shooting.

Aposhian said it’s possible that prosecutors could argue the armed security volunteer acted negligently or recklessly. 
“If you’re acting in self-defense, and you shoot and your bullet overpenetrates, or richochets, or it misses its mark and it hits an innocent party, you’re not going to be criminally liable unless it can you can be found that you acted with negligence or reckless disregard,” Aposhian said. “It’s an unintentional type of thing, but they’re going to have to show that you acted with reckless disregard.” 
Additionally, Aposhian noted that acting in self-defense “certainly does not necessarily protect you from a civil suit.” 
Evidentiary standards in civil lawsuits have much lower thresholds than in a criminal case, both Aposhian and Vilos said. 
“In a criminal case, it’s beyond a reasonable doubt, and in civil it’s whatever tips the scales, a preponderance of the evidence,” Aposhian said. 
Vilos said depending on potential insurance coverage for the victim or the men involved, “there’s probably a chance for a significant civil settlement.” But insurance coverage could hinge on what happens with criminal charges, if there are any. 
“If anybody really cares about the family (of the victim), the best thing that could happen would be a civil lawsuit that’s successful, and to heck with the criminal action because it’s probably going to be a loser, and it’s going to take a lot of resources,” Vilos said. “And it could actually harm the ability of the family to collect a civil damage award.” 
Should Utah allow open carry of long guns during protests?
Unlike 26 other states, Utah has not adopted a law prohibiting the open carrying of long guns at state capitols or political protests, according to Everytown Research & Policy, an organization that produces research on gun violence and advocates for gun violence prevention. The group has ranked Utah as No. 36 in the country for “gun law strength.” 
When asked whether lawmakers would be open to considering some type of policy change to restrict the open carrying of long guns during protests given what happened during the Salt Lake City “No Kings” protest, House Speaker Mike Schultz told reporters last week “Utah is a very proud Second Amendment state.”

“Finding that balance is what we want to try to do, and I think we’ve done a good job with it in the past,” he said. 
Schultz, however, left the door open to a discussion. 
“As we enter into the legislative session and we have more details around what happened, I’m sure some of those conversations will happen and we’ll see where it goes from there,” Schultz said. 
Aposhian — who has been lobbying for Second Amendment rights for 30 years — acknowledged that carrying a gun openly, especially a type of gun “that has been demonized, an AR-15, it’s very provocative.” 
“And anything you do will be viewed through the eyes of someone who may or may not appreciate AR-15s,” he said. 
Aposhian added that today’s polarized political climate — and given that some protests across the country have turned violent — can contribute to tensions. 
However, Aposhian added that the open carrying of firearms “is and always has been legal in Utah.” 
He predicted that any efforts to regulate what type of guns can be carried openly during political protests would be met with resistance from Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature. And it’s not something that he or the Utah Shooting Sports Council would be supportive of, either. 
It would be an “emotional response,” he said. “Emotion really doesn’t make for good laws.”
So while open carrying a gun like an AR-15 rifle may be “provocative,” Aposhian said it’s also a form of exercising two constitutional rights — the right to free speech and the right to bear arms — at the same time. 
“Carrying that gun is utilizing both those rights,” he said.

A University of Alabama professor accused Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, of threatening the budget of an honors program if its curriculum wasn't changed to comply with Alabama's DEI ban. (Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector).BIRMINGHAM — A University of Alabama professor and administrator Wednesday accused a member of the Alabama House of Representatives of threatening a fellowship program’s budget if its curriculum was not changed to comply with a state law banning DEI programs and so-called “divisive concepts.”
In an evidentiary hearing in a federal lawsuit over the statute, known as SB 129, Dana Patton, director of the Witt Fellows Program and a political science professor at the University of Alabama, testified that university officials told her a “powerful person in Montgomery” was behind complaints alleging the Dr. Robert E. Witt Program, an interdisciplinary honors program at UA focused on community service, was violating the law.
“Clearly, a very powerful person was behind this complaint for me to be asked to provide such extensive detail about my course,” Patton said in testimony before U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor. “I did not know who she was referring to. When I hear ‘very powerful person,’ I generally think it’s either a big donor to the university, a board of trustee member or state legislator.”

The anonymous complaints, which Patton received on October 15 and read during her testimony, alleged that “divisive concepts (were) embedded in UA Dr. Robert Witt Fellows program.” It stated that five students complained that “the viewpoints in the required reading books are presented as the correct perspective, and other opinions are shut down,” and “the students have stated they feel unsafe and scared to speak in class, unable to express their viewpoints in the classroom or in class assignments.”

Patton testified that at a University of Alabama game on Nov. 16, 2024, she was introduced to Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, one of two legislative committees that oversees the Education Trust Fund budget, in the president’s box at Bryant-Denny Stadium.  
She further testified that at that meeting, she had a 45-minute conversation with Garrett where he asked her if she knew about the complaints, which she told him she did. According to Patton, Garrett said that Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, “was not going to let this thing go” and that she was very “tenacious.”
Citing the litigation, Garrett in a phone call Wednesday declined to comment on Patton’s allegations. A message seeking comment was left with DuBose.
The lawsuit, filed in January, alleged that SB 129, sponsored by Sen Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, violated the First and Fourteenth amendments by prohibiting public funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and limiting discussions of so-called “divisive concepts.” Plaintiffs also allege the new law is confusing, vague and discriminatory.
Patton also said she understood a comment allegedly made by Garrett at the UA game, telling Patton he is chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, as a threat against her university program.
“He told me he’s the chair of the budget. He’s in charge of the budget. He answers to the taxpayers. He controls the budget, and all of this conversation was in relation to talking about the complaint and talking about my program and my courses. Well, I took it very much as a threat against the budget of my program,” she said.
Jay Ezelle, an attorney representing the members of the University of Alabama Board of Trustees, did not address those allegations or ask for clarification when cross-examining Patton, who said she does not know if any complaints were investigated and remains unclear whether they came from within the university community. 
After the hearing, Ezelle declined to comment on the complaints and would not vouch for their authenticity, saying that he didn’t want to possibly identify one of the anonymous complainers.
“I won’t comment on that,” he said, saying that his public comments are on the court record.
Garrett texted Patton following their introduction in November, according to evidence presented to the court, saying that he “will be working with (Vice Chancellor of External Affairs) Charlie Taylor to set up a time for you, the Honors College Dean and me to meet with a couple of other legislators who have raised concerns. As I expressed today, my desire is to address/resolve concerns and avoid potential major issues in the future.”
Patton said she “took that as a threat.” 
“Well, he wants to talk to avoid major issues in the future. He had made it clear that he controls the budget. He had told me that the state legislature was upset with the program. I’ve been asked about the books that I assign. He’s saying we need to avoid major issues. We need (to) compromise about my class and my decisions about it. It felt very much like a threat to me,” Patton said.
Patton said she has already made some changes to her courses as of her testimony Wednesday, and plans to make more for next semester. She has discontinued the use of the Harvard Implicit Association Test (IAT), a test that analyses a person’s subconscious bias.
 Patton said that while she was not asked to make that change, she’s afraid that it could lead to more complaints, putting her in a similar situation again. She said that while she tells students the IAT doesn’t label them as racist or sexist, she cannot control their “feelings of guilt,” which could lead to accusations of violating SB 129, especially concerning the law’s mention of subconscious concepts. 
In her introductory “Understanding Poverty” class, Patton said next semester she will stop showing three documentaries that tend to elicit “visceral reaction” and “feelings of guilt and anger” in students, particularly regarding topics like convict leasing.
“That’s my main concern based on SB 129. I can’t control how students feel when they view these documentaries,” she said.
The hearing will continue Thursday with testimony from University of Alabama students impacted by SB 129, followed by a presentation of evidence by lawyers for the UA Board of Trustees, though they did not indicate who might testify.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tuscaloosa_McLelland16734-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420

The land shaded in pink could be opened for oil and gas exploration. (Department of Natural Resources map)The Alaska Department of Natural Resources is considering whether or not to open state-owned land near the Yukon River to oil and gas exploration.
In a public notice published in May and renewed June 18, the agency said it “intends to evaluate the acceptability of an oil and gas exploration license proposal for the Yukon Flats area.”
The Yukon Flats cover a vast area of Interior Alaska, and the state’s proposal includes only “unencumbered” state-owned lands, primarily near the Dalton Highway, the town of Livengood, the Steese Highway and the Yukon River town of Circle.
The Yukon Flats are a relatively unexplored region when it comes to oil and gas potential.
This summer, the private oil company Hilcorp is drilling for oil on land owned by the Alaska Native corporation Doyon Ltd.
Historically, the prospect of oil development in the area has been controversial; the Yukon Flats are home to the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to large amounts of wildlife.
The refuge is not included in the state proposal, and most of the refuge is a significant distance from the state-owned land being considered for oil and gas exploration.
The state’s exploration licensing program requires a public comment period before the DNR commissioner makes a final determination about whether state lands in the Yukon Flats should be open to exploration.
After that determination, interested explorers would be able to submit license applications that would permit them to conduct seismic surveying and test drilling for oil and gas.

That was the main message Wednesday for an online presentation featuring top executives from four organizations that have membership straddling the border. The presentation came just days before the teams face a deadline from Kansas on its proposal to build new stadiums for both teams.
“We get this question a lot,” said Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council. “Does the regional business and civic community have a preference for which side of the state line or which specific location the teams land? No. As long as the teams land within the KC region, we’re going to support their decision, full stop.”
The presentation focused on how Kansas City competes with other metro areas. At no point during the debates in Kansas or Missouri over public financing for stadiums has either team said it was considering moving out of the region. 
Such a move would require the concurrence of other team owners. No city or state other than Missouri and Kansas have made public overtures to the teams. 
The sentiment that the state line was the smallest consideration for Kansas City businesses was echoed by the other participants, the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, which hosted the presentation, the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City and the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation.
“The more that we can stand united as one KC, and understand that our competition are those other regions that want the assets we have or are competing to attract what we want to get as well, I think we’re going to be stronger and we’re going to win,” said Joe Reardon, CEO of the Kansas City chamber.
Missouri special session ends with passage of KC stadium funding, disaster aid

Missouri lawmakers this month approved a plan to finance up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, committing almost $1.5 billion in future tax revenue. The current facilities, Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium, were opened in the early 1970s and almost all other stadiums built near that time are no longer in use, Reardon noted in the presentation.
Kansas, under a plan approved last year by the Kansas Legislature, is offering to pay up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums if the teams cross the state border.
During the debates in both states, the focus was on winning the “border war”. 
For Missouri, the loss of either team would mean another major league team leaving the state. St. Louis lost the NFL’s Rams in 2015, the football Cardinals in 1987 and the NBA’s Hawks in 1968. Kansas City lost Major League Baseball’s Athletics in 1967 and the Kings NBA franchise in 1985.
Kansas City is the smallest market that has both an NFL team and a Major League Baseball team.
For Kansas, it would be the first time a team from the NFL or Major League Baseball called the state its home.
“Our competition is not in Missouri or Kansas, it’s outside the region,” Cowden said. “We need to keep them at bay at arm’s length. This is not, in our opinion, about a border war. It truly is about a border solution.”
The success of Kansas City sports teams, especially the Chiefs, has raised the national and international profile of the region, said Kathy Nelson of the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation and Visit KC.
“They are opening doors to businesses like we never heard,” she said.
The Chiefs have played in five of the six most recent Super Bowls. The 2025 game had a national audience of 127 million and international audience estimated at 62 million. The romance between Taylor Swift and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has also boosted the city’s profile, she said.
The Royals made the playoffs last year for the first time since winning the World Series in 2015. They have a more regional audience, she said, with 80% of game attendees living within 75 miles of downtown Kansas City.
“Nothing else puts us on a global stage like our sports teams,” Nelson said. “There’s nothing else like this.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/KC-stadiums-2048x1150-1-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420

The March Against Fear, which became known as the “Meredith March,” ended at the Mississippi Capitol in Jackson. James Meredith, who started the one-man march before being shot, had recovered enough to help finish it with Martin Luther King Jr., who spoke. Leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee used the event to organize Black voting across the state. By the time the march ended, leaders had crafted a manifesto that called on President Lyndon Johnson to “actively enforce existing federal laws to protect the rights of all Americans.” It was the last major event of a united civil rights movement.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/05052556/June26-Unidentified-marcher-holds-button-during-March-Against-Fear-Photo-Bob-Fitch-Standford-Libraries.jpg,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420

Gavin Newsom this week is a noteworthy — even heroic — response to financial problems caused by factors beyond their control, particularly President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
A summary of the $321 billion agreement issued by the state Senate declares, “Through the work of the Legislature and the governor the past two years, the budget was once again stabilized, with the governor’s January 10 proposed budget being balanced without needing new solutions. Unfortunately, since January, circumstances have changed, and California now faces a significant budget shortfall.”
“First and foremost,” the summary continues, “the policies of the new federal administration — in particular the tariff increase policies — have caused economic forecasts throughout the world to be significantly downgraded.”
It goes on to cite “to a modest degree, the baseline costs of key programs — particularly Medi-Cal — have grown faster than projected … and third, to a smaller degree, the devastating LA fires have had a negative economic impact and resulted in increased state spending.”
That scenario is fictional, conjured up to mask the fact that Newsom and legislators have been overspending revenues for three years, ever since the governor erroneously declared that the state had an almost $100 billion surplus — long before fires hit Los Angeles and Trump was inaugurated.
The supposed surplus ignited a multi-billion-dollar flurry of new spending in 2022, that has persisted. The administration finally admitted, a year ago, that it overstated projected revenues by $165 billion over four years.
The initial 2025-26 budget that Newsom proposed in January had an $11 billion general fund gap between revenues and spending. His revised budget, released in May, had a $19 billion deficit even with a number of spending cuts, mostly in services for the poor and elderly. The budget deal expands the deficit to $21 billion.
Newsom’s revised budget started the blame-it-on-Trump syndrome and legislative leaders quickly embraced it to explain away their chronic failure to either reduce spending or raise taxes to balance income and outgo, a condition known in the Capitol as a “structural deficit.”
Thus all of the versions of the budget, including the semi-final one unveiled this week, would fill the gaps for another year with payment deferrals, loans, accounting gimmicks and raids on reserves meant to cushion the effects of genuine emergencies.
Direct and indirect loans to the general fund budget come from special funds set aside for specific purposes, and after three years of deficit spending the state has accumulated many billions of dollars of internal debt that will have to be repaid sometime.
The accounting gimmickry takes several forms, such as delaying $2.3 billion in support payments to community colleges and local school systems that are due in June 2026 until a month later, thus shifting them from one fiscal year to another.
Officials call such maneuvers “solutions,” but they don’t solve anything. They merely stave off the day of reckoning when officialdom runs out of tricks. That day will probably come after Newsom has left the governorship and is, perhaps, running for president.
In effect, the state has adopted the same hide-the-pea approach to budgeting that the federal government employs, one that has resulted in a multi-trillion-dollar national debt. Trump, by the way, appears to continue that spend-now-pay-later practice with his “big beautiful bill” that, by all accounts, would grow the national debt even more.
Were a private corporation to cook its books like the state government does, its executives could wind up in jail for fraud. For some strange reason, however, California’s voters continue to tolerate the Capitol’s chronic fiscal malpractice.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

The House District 63 seat opened up after Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, resigned earlier this month to become president of the Alabama Public Service Commission.
Judith Taylor, a Democrat, is a first-time candidate who said she is running for office to give voters a choice.
“I am really tired of not having Democrats on the ballot,” the 63-year-old retiree said in an interview Tuesday morning. 
She said she wants to prioritize reducing poverty and food shortages, improving the quality of public education and monitoring out-of-state property owners.
“We desperately need public education, and it shouldn’t cover the cost of someone going to private school,” the first-time candidate said.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like education savings account that allows applicants to spend up to $7,000 on education-related expenses, including private school tuition. It is funded through the Education Trust Fund, which is the state’s budget for public education.
She said that she is concerned about foreign entities and corporations owning land in Alabama, but not having to pay their share of taxes.
“I think it’s time we looked at all people and the least of us need to have the benefit,” Taylor said. “I do think that corporations should pay their share, and I think the wealthy among us should pay their fair share. I don’t resent paying more in taxes than a lot of poor people do, but I do resent that I’m paying more in taxes than Walmart.”
Norman Crow, a Republican and Tuscaloosa city councilman, said the opportunity to represent Tuscaloosa County in Montgomery is furthering his passion for public service. 
“When Cynthia, Representative Almond, resigned her position to take the president of the Public Service Commission, I felt like it was a huge opportunity for me to take another step towards serving our community on a statewide basis,” the real estate agent said in an interview Tuesday evening.
He said he wants to prioritize maintaining a business-friendly environment in Alabama, furthering economic development and improving education.
“I think that being supportive of workforce development is very important,” the 57-year-old said. “Having our communities in Alabama ready for the potential growth that needs to happen for good paying jobs is important.”
He said that improving education goes beyond educating children, but also includes educating adults for the future.
“Continuing to work to improve education in the state of Alabama is so important to prepare our students, but also adults, for the jobs of tomorrow,” Crow said.
Taylor said that voters should choose her so the Legislature has more Democrats and diverse debates.
“I think they should choose me because I care about the people, the common everyday people, and I think that those who are underserved need someone to speak for them,” she said. “I think that we need more Democrats in office. We need more options for our voters, and we need different sides for the issues to be discussed.”
Crow said his political experience and familiarity of the district makes him the best candidate. 
“I really know the district, and I feel like I’m in a good position to understand constituents and help with what the priorities of District 63 are,” Crow said.

But the cuts could hit harder, later, they were warned.","The West Front of the U.S. Capitol in May. Lawmakers are scrambling to finish a budget reconciliation bill that will make deep spending cuts. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Coming federal budget cuts will likely have severe impacts on Maryland, but they could come later than expected and their impact will not be felt right away, lawmakers were told Wednesday.
But that little bit of breathing room will not change the fact that the state still needs to brace for potentially massive cuts to programs like food assistance and Medicaid, state analysts and officials said.
The comments came during the first meeting of the new Joint Federal Action Oversight Committee, created this session to track how policies from the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress could affect Marylanders and the state.
“There are lots of enormous questions ahead for the state of Maryland,” Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said during the 90-minute virtual committee meeting. “We want to make sure that we are monitoring the impact as we move forward.”
While there may be a longer on-ramp to the anticipated federal cuts, the impact will still be “dire and concerning,” House Majority Whip. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) said during the meeting.
Lawmakers heard from analysts with the Department of Legislative Services and federal relations officials from the governor’s office to get a layout of the current budget talks.
They also got an update from Attorney General Anthony Brown on the many legal actions Maryland has joined to challenge Trump administration policies changes, program cuts and federal worker firings, among other efforts.
Buyout offers, hiring freeze coming for state government amid budget crunch

David Romans with DLS said that the cuts for fiscal 2026 are “not as horrible as we had worried about” duringn the legislative session, but that cuts down the line will be “more significant.”
“We think the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and Medicaid changes will likely increase state costs by somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million in fiscal ’26,” Romans said. “Part of the reason for that … is that some of the provisions have delayed effective dates. So a lot of things that are going to cause problems for the states don’t go into effect immediately.
“The outyear impacts are much more significant in our view. And again, it depends on where the (U.S.) House and Senate end up,” Romans said.
Some of biggest concerns are cuts to SNAP, as both the U.S. House and Senate plan to shift more of the cost burden onto states and reduce federal spending for the program. Romans said that the risk for Maryland in out years is up to $450 million annually, according to DLS estimates.
He said the state may save some money from lower Medicaid enrollment, which could offset anticipated increases to administrative costs needed to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on recipients that will be required under the bill.
But lawmakers argued that those savings, if any, would be quickly consumed by the rise in “uncompensated care,” as more uninsured people would likely seek health care from emergency rooms. Estimates from national health advocacy groups say that about 130,000 Marylanders could be kicked off of Medicaid due to work requirements that are part of budget proposals working their way through Congress now.
An additional challenge could be prohibitions on health care that goes toward undocumented immigrants.
Romans said that Maryland’s Healthy Babies Equity Act, which provides Medicaid coverage during pregnancy regardless of immigration status, might be at risk depending on how officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services interpret the bill.
He said that the state currently receives $100 million in federal funding for the healthy babies program that would no longer be available under the current budget reconciliation language.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But in addition to federal funding cuts, Maryland could be on the hook for financial penalties if the state continues to provide health care coverage for pregnant undocumented immigrants, even if the state only uses state dollars.
Matthew Verghese, director and senior adviser for the Governor’s Federal Relations Office, said that there are still details being worked out in the budget reconciliation legislation, and it’s not clear how the House and Senate will work out differences between their versions of the bill.
“I would not total all these numbers up to figure out what the impact of the state will be. Some of it is double-counted, but clearly we’re looking at potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in lost federal funds, and more administrative costs, if these changes go forward,” he said of the various cuts to Medicaid.
Currently, the budget reconciliation bill in the hands of the U.S. Senate has bigger cuts than the House version of the legislation — but would grant states more time to adapt to some of those cuts.
Legislative leaders had considered calling a special session later this summer to rapidly adapt the state budget or other policies, if necessary, in reaction to federal decisions.
Ferguson said that the urgency for a special session this fall has dropped, though they are keeping the option “on the back burner.”
“The necessity for a specially session is probably less than it was when we left in April. But there are still enormous questions out there that could shift things at any point,” Ferguson said to reporters after the briefing.

“It does look like … we will have time to deal with a lot of these issues in January” when the 2026 General Assembly convenes, he said. “And that the administration will have enough flexibility in the meantime to deal with some of the more pressing pieces and components of the bill.”
Fiscal house ‘built on sand’
But state Republicans repeated their charge that much of the problems Maryland faces under the budget reconciliation act are self-inflicted.
“Our generous Medicaid expansions and extensive support for undocumented immigrants are not federal mandates — they’re policy choices made here in Annapolis,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) said in a written statement. “If we can’t afford them, we have the ability and responsibility to revise those policies.
“Instead, Maryland leaders double down, accepting limited federal funds to justify unsustainable programs that burden state taxpayers,” Hershey said. “It’s time to stop asking them to bankroll the liberal wish list.”
That was echoed by Sen. Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll).
“Ironically, the same state government that’s crying about unfunded mandates from Washington is the first to force them onto our counties,” Ready said. “We need responsible budgeting, immigration enforcement, and less reliance on Washington—because right now, our fiscal house is built on sand.”
The briefing comes just one day after Gov. Wes Moore announced a state hiring freeze and worker  buyouts with the goal of saving $121 million to help offset the tight budget in fiscal 2026, which starts Tuesday. That plan would appear to block previous goals of the governor, to fill vacant state jobs and hire federal workers who lose their jobs as part of Trump administration cuts,
Ferguson said the state will try to backfill as much lost federal dollars as possible to keep Medicaid and SNAP afloat, but with the state’s tight margins “it is likely that we will not be able to cover everywhere.”
“Given the scope of the challenges, it is unlikely that in the short term, that we will be able to provide at the same level that we have been able to,” Ferguson said after the meeting. “Given the destruction of the historic federal and state partnership that we have had for many of these safety net programs.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/uscapitolmay72025-4_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

The city’s acts amount to “the most severe violation of a court order witnessed by this Court in its extensive experience adjudicating high-profile litigation,” Williams wrote in an order filed Tuesday, adding the city’s “repeated, willful, and bad-faith defiance” of judicial orders “is unparalleled” and reflects a “shocking disregard” for the court, especially from a municipality.
MaQuade Chesley, Mesquite’s former police chief, is suing the city for wrongful termination and defamation. 
Chesley was fired in January by then-City Manager Edward “Owen” Dickie, who initially cited a vote of no confidence by the Mesquite police union as the reason for the termination. He later said Chesley was fired for recording a conversation, which is not illegal in Nevada. 
The Current was first to report multiple recordings Mesquite residents and Chesley provided of Dickie making racially-charged statements regarding the hiring of the city’s next police chief. 
The council, by a vote of 4 to 1, terminated Dickie in late April, citing the recordings. 
Chesley’s attorney, Philip Trenchak, contends in court filings the city is attempting to cover up its actions by failing to provide documents requested in the litigation, redacting entire pages, and cancelling scheduled depositions.
In an order issued Tuesday, Williams found the city engaged in “Bad Faith ‘Hide the Ball’ Discovery tactics,” and found the city “systematically and intentionally violated” his court orders by “producing deficient, redacted, and duplicative documents, asserting improper objections, and failing to produce critical evidence…”
Chesley, who joined the Mesquite police force in 2007, says rumors allegedly circulated by former City Attorney Bob Sweetin and then-Mesquite employee Shannon Harris, prompted what has become a drawn out legal battle.
“I was told and believe that both Sweetin and Harris joined together to spread defamatory lies about me,” Chesley told the Current on Wednesday.
The alleged rumors suggested Chesley was having sexual relationships with young girls. He filed a harassment complaint with Human Resources. 
“I’ve been a police executive for the past 14 years. I’ve always held myself to a higher standard,” Chesley said earlier this year. “To be accused of these things floored me. It destroyed me and my family.” 
Williams, in his order, wrote that Chesley sought unredacted responses to subpoenas served on the city, “particularly documents related to an investigation of Shannon Harris, who allegedly referred to Plaintiff as ‘Chief Pedophile.’”
Instead, the city “produced heavily redacted documents, with entire pages blacked out, citing attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, despite the Court’s order for unredacted production.”
Williams found the city’s “selective redaction” of the Harris investigation was unjustified, and “further supports a finding of bad faith.”
The city’s “heavy redactions of documents, particularly entire pages of the Harris investigation report,” demonstrate an intent to conceal evidence of misconduct by City employees, the judge wrote, adding the city’s actions have “severely prejudiced Plaintiff’s ability to prepare his case, as these materials are central to his claims of defamation and misconduct by City employees.”
Mesquite’s “egregious and willful violations, including untimely and deficient productions, misrepresentations to the Court, and obstruction of discovery, warrant sanctions,” Williams wrote, adding he’d determine after further briefing “whether the ultimate sanction of default is appropriate…” 
In the meantime, Williams awarded attorneys fees and costs to Chesley for recent motions related to the city’s failure to comply with the court. The city’s delay and obstruction “constitute a chilling effect on the litigation process, potentially deterring Plaintiff from pursuing his claims due to escalating costs and frustration.”
Williams also found the attorney representing the city, Jorge “Coco” Padilla, made misrepresentations to the court, an act he says “compounds the bad faith exhibited throughout the discovery process.”
Padilla said he hasn’t seen the order and declined to comment. 
The city’s acts, Williams wrote, undermine the integrity of the judicial process. He gave the city deadlines next month to comply with his orders. 
Earlier this month, in a related case, Judge Nadia Krall issued contempt of court findings against former City Attorney Mike Branum and outside counsel Marcus Lee, for violating her order not to proceed with an agendized city council item to ratify Chesley’s termination.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mesquite7_SM-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

June 25, 2025 | Photo by Leah Craig/Michigan AdvanceMedicaid has long been described as a safety net. But for many Michiganders, it’s much more than that: it’s a means of survival. As the U.S. Senate debates drastic cuts to the program under the GOP’s “big beautiful bill,” Michiganders are stepping up to share what’s at stake. 
At a vigil hosted by Protect MI Care, state legislators, community advocates, and citizens gathered on the Michigan Capitol’s east lawn to reaffirm support of Medicaid in the face of the proposed rollbacks. 
State Senator Sylvia Santana (D-Detroit) asserted that this moment “demands a collective rejection of policies that put ideology over impact and reaffirmation of our commitment to protecting the health and dignity of every Michigan resident.” 
“Medicaid is more than just a program,” she told the crowd. “ It is a promise that in times of need, this state will not turn its back on its people.”
Some of these Michiganders shared their stories at Wednesday’s vigil.
For Katie O’Neil, Medicaid provided her son with a childhood.
O’Neil’s son was born 11 weeks premature and entered foster care as a newborn, which qualified him for Medicaid. At two months old, he was hospitalized with RSV, a respiratory virus that can be severe in infants, and diagnosed with subglottic stenosis—a narrowing of his airway. Doctors performed a tracheostomy, and her son required round-the-clock care and specialized medical equipment, all of which was covered by Medicaid.
Years later, surgeons rebuilt his airway. Because his adoption was nearly finalized, O’Neil was able to see for the first time just how much that hospital stay cost: over $100,000 just for a two-week stay.

Medicaid provided a stability O’Neil hadn’t thought possible. Since that two-week stay, her son, now six years old, has had five procedures, with a sixth planned for summer. And yet, she didn’t have to worry or fight with the insurance company.  Because of Medicaid, she was able to focus on her son.
“Because of Medicaid, my child, who could not speak a word until after he turned three, can talk and tell jokes and yell at his little sister,” O’Neil explained, adding that “most people don’t even know he ever had any medical issues.”
Now, she faces the uncertainty of another surgery this summer, and the looming threat that the federal government might cut the very program that has supported her family every step of the way.
For Sarah Abend, Medicaid was the only support that made her work—and life—sustainable. 
She was inspired to share her story by U.S. Sen. Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota), who recently claimed that “the best health care is a job.”
“I stand here as evidence that is not true, Senator Thune,” she said at Wednesday’s vigil. 
“I am the job, and I don’t come with health care,” Abend said.
Abend is an artist, former teacher, and small business owner. She’s also a Medicaid beneficiary– something she was once embarrassed to tell people. It felt shameful, she explained, “because our society taught me that needing assistance meant personal failure.”
However, Abend soon realized that utilizing Medicaid was not an indicator of personal failure. The failure did not lie with her, she said, but with the system– chiefly the idea that healthcare is a luxury, rather than a fundamental right. 
Moreover, Abend explained, our economy depends on creative and service work. And yet, that same system abandons these workers all too frequently.
“The economy depends on teachers, artists, service workers, caregivers, people doing essential work that often doesn’t come with benefits,” Abend said. “If we’re going to have a system that needs low-wage workers to function, then we have a moral obligation to ensure those workers can afford to stay healthy and alive.”

For Nathan Dunbar, Medicaid was a new beginning.
“I had nosedived my life with drugs and criminal activity and being a general menace,” he admitted. Tired of prison and chaos, he sought to start over.
“I didn’t have any way to pay for the services I was going to need to unravel the screwed-upness I’d injected into my life,” Dunbar said. “I relied on Medicaid funds to help me figure out how to get my life going.”
Since 2016, he’s stayed sober, become a father, and works at Community Mental Health, mentoring other addicts in their recovery. Dunbar has become, in his own words, “an exemplary citizen.”
Still, he expressed concern for what the proposed cuts to Medicaid might mean for those struggling with addiction. 
“People need help, and if we have no way to deliver that help, then those people will be left to their own devices trying to figure things out,” Dunbar said. “If you don’t know the direction, you have to ask somebody, and if there’s nobody to ask because they cut all the funding, there’ll be nobody offering that direction. And our city, Lansing, our state, Michigan, the place we love, our neighbors that we care about, will all suffer.” 
Protect MI Care, in conjunction with the Governor’s office, has compiled “14,905 real stories from real Michiganders on how losing access to Medicaid would be detrimental to themselves and their families.” 
Binders full of these stories will be hand-delivered to the seven Michigan representatives who voted for the bill: Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet), Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland), John James (R-Shelby Township), Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Township), John Moolenaar (R-Caledonia), and Tim Walberg (R-Tipton).
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives 215 to 214, and the U.S. Senate is anticipated to vote by the end of the week.
Meanwhile, Protect MI Care will be hosting a Hands Off Medicaid Rally on Saturday in Lansing. Speakers will include U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut), Michigan leaders, and healthcare advocates from across the state.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Several state legislators want to take the New Jersey State Police out of the state attorney general’s supervision and make it its own entity, a move that comes amid escalating tensions between the two.
Under a bipartisan bill introduced last week, the 3,000-member agency would no longer be a division under the Department of Law and Public Safety, which Attorney General Matt Platkin heads, and instead would become a state department, with its superintendent answering directly to the governor.
Sen. Michael Testa (R-Cumberland) said he signed on as one of the bill’s five sponsors because of directives Platkin and his predecessor, Gurbir Grewal, have issued in recent years that limit police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents and divert law-breaking youth from criminal justice involvement.
Those directives have kept officers from doing their jobs, Testa said. The agency’s top brass should instead decide policing policies, he added.
“I want the state police to have the handcuffs taken off of them and put the handcuffs on the criminals, where they belong,” he said.
Beyond disagreements over directives, the attorney general’s role in ensuring police accountability also has increasingly put him at odds with the state’s largest police force.
Platkin’s office oversees police licensing, investigates fatal police encounters and official misconduct, and publicly reports major discipline levied against officers statewide. He’s issued bombshell reports on racism in the agency’s promotions and internal affairs and has been investigating allegations that state troopers reduced traffic enforcement in response to racial profiling claims.

Several of the bill’s sponsors deny that it’s a response to such scrutiny.
“This legislation has nothing to do with that,” said Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris).
It has more to do with bureaucracy, he added.
“I’ve heard from a number of retired troopers over the last couple of years that promotions are slow getting done, that different things that are requested take a long time to get approved,” Bucco said. “That makes an awful lot of sense because the attorney general’s office is enormous. The Department of Law and Public Safety is enormous. The attorney general has a lot on his plate, and to put the state police in there as a division promotes, almost, that turmoil because sometimes they can’t operate as efficiently and as quickly as they should be able to.”
Sen. Robert Singer (R-Monmouth) conceded that Platkin has ruffled a lot of feathers since he became attorney general in February 2022.
“I don’t think the AG has missed poking anybody in the eye, from the governor on down,” Singer said.
But he said he signed on as a bill sponsor because he felt the state police deserve “a seat at the table,” and Col. Patrick Callahan, the agency’s superintendent since 2017, should have equal footing with other members of the governor’s cabinet.
Sen. James Beach (D-Camden), the bill’s leading sponsor, seconded that sentiment but also pointed to Platkin’s lack of policing experience.
“We have a politically appointed attorney general, a politically appointed lawyer, who really doesn’t know anything about policing and has never been a cop, and he is telling a force of men and women who are professionals in policing what they can and can’t do,” Beach said. “I just don’t think it makes sense.”
Mike Symons, a spokesman for Platkin’s office, and Murphy spokeswoman Tyler Jones declined to comment. Spokespeople for the state police didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The bill has the cautious support of the NAACP New Jersey State Conference, whose leaders have long called for a clean sweep of the state police’ top brass over discrimination concerns.
Attorney Gregg Zeff, who represents the NAACP, said the group supports the bill conceptually but wants improvements to “give it teeth.” That could come in the form of other legislative efforts to create an inspector general in New Jersey to ensure robust, independent oversight of the police.
“The primary function of our State Police is law enforcement and public safety. The attorney general’s primary function should be legal leadership, oversight, and prosecution. The overlap in these functions makes it difficult in both offices to avoid conflicts and provide appropriate leadership without blending many separate issues together— resulting often, in our opinion, in quid pro quo decisions, actions, and compromises that the public cannot easily reconcile,” Zeff said in a statement.
Lauren Bonds heads the National Police Accountability Project.
State police being under the direct supervision of a governor is “the standard model” in most states around the country, she said. But shifting who’s tasked with police oversight for political reasons also is common, she added.
“This is usually a supportive relationship that you see between state police and the state’s AG, but there can be times where there is tension and division, when the attorney general is maybe a progressive prosecutor or somebody who came in with police reform being one of their top priorities,” Bonds said.
The bill has no Assembly companion and is unlikely to pass this legislative session because lawmakers are expected to recess by Tuesday for the summer and not return until after the November general election. They then have less than two months to act on unfinished business before the next legislative session begins Jan. 13.
January is also when a new governor will be sworn in — Murphy cannot seek a third term in November — who will presumably name their own attorney general to replace Platkin.

Although Vermont has strong protections for abortion on the books, those protections mean nothing if patients have nowhere to access the service.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nicole Clegg: After Roe, 3 years of resistance, care and community.","This commentary is by Nicole Clegg, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.


Three years ago, most Americans assumed that the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was the final check mark on the anti-abortion movement’s to-do list. Overnight, federal protections for abortions evaporated, and states suddenly had the power to decide who could access abortion and under what circumstances. 
But overturning Roe was just the beginning. The decision served as a catalyst to pass more restrictions on abortion and repeal safeguards for health centers providing abortion care, and it emboldened anti-abortion extremists to commit more violent acts — like the tragic events that took place in Minnesota. 
Support for abortion rights is the highest it’s been in history and 81% of Americans don’t want politicians involved in decisions about pregnancy. Anti-abortion groups know that pursuing a nationwide ban is politically toxic, but that hasn’t stopped them.
They’re reversing federal protections through executive orders, like the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, criminalizing abortion providers and patients, and hiding abortion bans in bills where they don’t belong. 
Congress is currently considering a budget bill that includes a provision to ban patients insured by Medicaid from getting care at Planned Parenthood. Despite the claims to the contrary, the bill has nothing to do with fiscal responsibility — banning Planned Parenthood would cost taxpayers $300 million — and everything to do with the fact that Planned Parenthood provides abortion care. 
If the measure passes and the Trump Administration withholds other funds we receive, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England would lose $5 million annually, or 42% of our patient revenue. These funds cover cancer screenings, birth control, wellness exams and so much more. We are a critical safety net provider in New England and without us, Vermonters will suffer. 
This attack highlights that although Vermont has strong protections for abortion on the books, those protections mean nothing if patients have nowhere to access the service. Planned Parenthood health centers are an irreplaceable part of Vermont’s health care system, serving nearly 16,000 patients annually who rely on us for birth control, STI testing and treatment, cancer screenings and other preventive care. Patients and communities in Vermont will suffer.
In only three years, we have heard countless stories of women getting turned away from emergency rooms, medevacked to a “legal” state, losing their ability to become pregnant in the future and in some cases, even losing their lives. It’s an injustice and could jeopardize the future of an entire generation. At PPNNE, we are determined to do all we can to safeguard our patients’ health and rights. 
We are expanding access to abortion. 94% of our health centers now offer abortion services, with a goal to reach 100% in the coming year. We’ve knocked down financial barriers by growing our abortion fund. PPNNE provides practical support to patients traveling to us for care, including help with lodging, travel, childcare and more. 
We opened our doors wider and welcomed patients from across the country — people who should never have had to leave their home state. 10% of our abortion patients hail from another state including Texas, Florida, and Georgia and other states where abortion is banned. PPNNE has served patients from 36 states since the fall of Roe. 
We’ve also seen firsthand the emotional toll this crisis has taken. Patients often arrive at our health centers exhausted and scared. But they leave with dignity, care and support — because we believe your access to care shouldn’t depend on your ZIP code. 
The overturning of Roe may have been the green light for the anti-abortion movement. But it has also served as a spark for PPNNE and our communities. When access to abortion is under attack, we become the shield.
We stand between harmful policies and the people they’re designed to hurt. We show up — every day — to protect care, to protect patients and to protect the fundamental right to make personal decisions about our bodies and futures. And we won’t give up until that freedom is guaranteed for all.

Passing something that is rushed and does not promote equity, affordability or quality schools is not better than nothing.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Caitlin MacLeod-Bluver: A dereliction of duty.","This commentary is by Caitlin MacLeod-Bluver of Moretown. She is the 2025 Vermont Teacher of the Year and teaches English and history at Winooski High School.


On Monday, I sat in the Senate chamber and watched a senator sleep through one of the most consequential bills in recent Vermont history. Then, I sat on the Statehouse lawn with my two young children, livestreaming the House hastily doing a voice vote, where many representatives appeared surprised by what they had just done. 
Earlier in the day, I spoke with many representatives who did not recognize the complexities of H.454: they did not understand the implications for small schools like the one I will send my children to, they did not understand the consequences of what this would mean to lose our unique Winooski School District, nor did they recognize that public funds will continue to be fettered to private schools which lack the same accountability as public schools. 
As a teacher, I pride myself on holding students to high-quality standards for their work. I do not ask my students to rush through their assignments. I ask them to take their time, consider multiple perspectives, share with stakeholders, receive feedback, and revise, revise, and revise. Why are our lawmakers not doing the same?

I also teach my students that their voice matters; that in a democracy, they have representatives that represent their interests. This message rings hollow when they see it not fulfilled. My own senator, Sen. Cummings, did not respond to a single email from me and stated publicly she “stopped doing emails when [she] didn’t feel I could bleed anymore.” Sen. Baruth, representing Winooski where I teach, did not engage in dialogue with our school district once.
In the days and weeks leading up to the consequential vote, we heard again and again from lawmakers that passing something is better than nothing and that taxpayers want tax relief.
First, passing something that is rushed and does not promote equity, affordability, or quality schools is not indeed better than nothing. In my classroom, I mark work like this with a “NY”: not yet. Try again.
Second, taxpayers do indeed want tax relief, and the bill that Gov. Scott, Democrats and Republicans are celebrating does not provide it. Shame on our governor for putting us in this position and shame on everyone who followed suit.
In the coming weeks and months, there will be many small committees tasked with big decisions that will impact every student in our state, and thus play a lasting role in our state as a whole. I ask our lawmakers to think critically about the same questions I ask my students to think about: Whose voices are being heard? Whose voices are not at the table? How do these decisions affect the most vulnerable in our community?
Chances are, once again, teachers and students will not be there. A student texted me after the House voted for the bill, asking eagerly what happened. When she learned the fate of H.454 her response was plain and clear: “When has the government ever been on the side of education or the side of students’ like me?”
So lawmakers, please prove her wrong. Please let her know that you are on her side. Decisions that impact her future, that will destroy her district and the unique aspects of Winooski, are now in your hands, sadly.
And to everyone who cares deeply for public education, please stay engaged and keep fighting. My two children, who played on the state lawn before later holding protest signs against ICE, now associate the “golden dome” with making decisions that “hurt our school.” Our young people are always watching; show them that you care about their future.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana has used more than $491,000 in public funds to defend Attorney General Todd Rokita in multiple disciplinary investigations and formal ethics cases, according to new records obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
The state paid four law firms a combined $491,508 between 2022 and 2025 to represent Rokita in at least six separate matters before the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission — investigations that the Republican describes as politically motivated and retaliatory. 
Only two of the investigations resulted in formal disciplinary charges.
The Capital Chronicle previously reported partial figures showing dollars spent on Rokita’s disciplinary defense, but new records provide a more complete accounting.










We’re paying four law firms close to half a million dollars so that Todd Rokita can keep his law license and stay in office. That’s a campaign expense — not something the public should have to fund.


– Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis


The highest payment — more than $240,000 — went to Indianapolis-based Ammeen and Associates, which represents Rokita in the current ethics case still pending before the disciplinary commission.
The state paid an additional $177,650 to Greenwood-based Patrick Olmstead Law; $57,995 to Washington, D.C.-based Schaerr Jaffe; and $15,560 to Indianapolis-based Lewis and Wilkins, according to information released by the attorney general’s office.
Indiana’s Transparency Portal shows the legal firms have previously been contracted by Rokita’s office and other state agencies to assist with separate litigation and legal matters.
But Democrat Rep. Ed DeLaney, a longtime lawyer from Indianapolis, maintained that taxpayers “shouldn’t be footing the bill.”
“We’re paying four law firms close to half a million dollars so that Todd Rokita can keep his law license and stay in office,” he said. “That’s a campaign expense — not something the public should have to fund.”
Indiana has in the past covered legal costs for public attorneys, judges, and prosecutors facing complaints that arise from actions taken in the course of their official duties, as long as those actions aren’t criminal or personal in nature. One section in Indiana Code specifically requires the state to indemnify prosecutors for expenses incurred in lawsuits or disciplinary proceedings related to a “decision, a duty, an obligation, a privilege, or a responsibility of the prosecuting attorney’s office.”
Years of disciplinary investigations
The ongoing complaint stems from Rokita’s nationally televised comments in June 2022 about Indianapolis OB-GYN Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who oversaw a medication abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio that summer.
In an interview with Fox News commentator Jesse Watters, Rokita called Bernard an “activist acting as a doctor” and suggested that she violated patient privacy and state reporting laws. He said his office was investigating her conduct and would be “looking at her licensure.”
The Indiana Medical Licensing Board ultimately found that Bernard had violated patient privacy laws — resulting in a reprimand and a fine — but she was cleared of failing to report the abortion.
Rokita’s office settled an initial complaint about his comments in November 2023. In a sworn affidavit, Rokita admitted to violating two professional conduct rules in exchange for a public reprimand. A third count was dismissed.
Story continues below.
Exhibit B – Affidavit
 
Although he agreed not to contest the charges, the commission found that Rokita recanted almost immediately, suggesting in a public press release — issued just hours after the reprimand — that he had done nothing wrong.
The commission said Rokita acted with “a deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth” and has since opposed his request to dismiss the new charges.
But he maintains the taxpayer expense is the result of a politically charged and unaccountable disciplinary process.
“These investigations require time away from the job Hoosiers elected me to do,” Rokita said in a written statement. “Regardless of their false, politically motivated nature, each grievance, investigation and complaint requires time, attention and office resources to combat.”
“The Commission has caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money to be wasted and there is no end in sight,” he added.
Disciplinary commission rejects Indiana AG Todd Rokita’s call to dismiss latest ethics complaint

James Ammeen, one of Rokita’s defense attorneys, said “the Commission has caused this expensive situation by entertaining politically motivated grievances and by drawing out these investigations as long as legally possible only to not file anything in several cases.”
Three of the six investigations into the attorney general’s conduct originated from a single source, Indianapolis attorney Bill Groth. The labor lawyer was named the Indiana Democratic Party’s “Activist of the Year” in 2018 and has advocated for labor unions, employees and other progressive causes.
The disciplinary commission does not name complainants unless a case becomes public, but Groth and another Indianapolis attorney, Paula Cardoza-Jones, have openly revealed the grievances they filed. Republican State Sen. Liz Brown just last month also said she filed a complaint against Rokita.
“This whole thing still stems from 16 accurate words that I said on a Fox News interview over three years ago,” Rokita said. “Every complaint after has just been a follow-up to try and get me for something because they hate the issues I fight for on behalf of Hoosiers.”
“I accepted responsibility for the timing of my initial comments and indicated at the time that I could always do better,” he added. “Now, the Commission wants to waste time and money claiming I wasn’t ‘sorry’ enough, and wants a new punishment for 16 words said over three years ago.”
Rokita decries system
While defending himself, Rokita has also offered up proposed changes to how the disciplinary commission operates. 
He holds that the members shouldn’t be able to give political donations, and also called for commission meetings involving elected officials to be open to press and public scrutiny.
Rokita and his legal team have accused current and former members of the disciplinary commission of partisan bias. The attorney general specifically took aim at former Chair Bernie Carter, a Democrat who previously served as Lake County prosecutor.

Although he did not vote on Rokita’s current disciplinary complaint, Carter oversaw the commission when multiple earlier investigations into the attorney general’s conduct were opened.
Rokita’s office also pointed to current commission Chair Peter Rusthoven, a Republican lawyer who previously worked within former President Ronald Reagan’s administration.
Amid a GOP split by those who support President Donald Trump — and those who don’t — Rusthoven endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024. Although a longtime GOP donor, he also made contributions to her campaign, and to those for Joe Biden and Liz Cheney — all prominent Democrats or vocal Trump critics.
Rusthoven also believed Trump should be removed from the ballot while Rokita’s office was involved in litigation defending Trump’s candidacy before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“Some Commissioners undoubtedly disapprove of what the attorney general does and says in office,” said Rokita attorney Paul Mullin, “and (are) willing to impose the minority’s view despite (him) being elected by the largest number of Hoosiers in Indiana history.”
Although most disciplinary commission members donate to political candidates, Rokita said such contributions further undermine the body’s impartiality.
“The Attorney General has been nothing but transparent,” Mullin continued. “Instead, this process is being misused by political enemies and those working against the duly-elected AG’s policies. The strategy is to punish his own truthful speech, causing unneeded public expense and distraction.”
The disciplinary commission operates largely in secret under rules designed to protect reputations during the initial investigation phases. Rokita said that amounts to a lack of transparency, which leaves taxpayers in the dark.
Critics push back
But Rokita’s critics said the attorney general has blurred ethical lines by leveraging his public office for political messaging. 
DeLaney, the state lawmaker, argued that Rokita’s conduct, especially his public comments about Bernard, had little to do with his official duties and instead reflected personal political choices.
 Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis. (From the Indiana House Democrats)
“We didn’t say he had to go on national TV, and we certainly didn’t tell him to say what he said,” DeLaney added. “This isn’t about serving the public. It’s about preserving his own political standing.”
Former Attorney General Curtis Hill funded his own disciplinary defense, but his actions were after hours at a bar and were not work-related.
DeLaney also questioned why four outside law firms were needed.
“He doesn’t need four law firms,” DeLaney said. “He needs one person — to look in the mirror and ask if he’s solving problems or just being one.”
“Rokita brags every time he brings in a nickel for the state,” he continued. “But if we’re going to keep an accounting, we need to count what he’s spending, too. And I’ve never seen another official rack up this kind of bill to protect his own law license.”
Anja Matwijkiw, a professor of professional ethics and human rights at Indiana University Northwest, agreed that there are questions about whether Rokita was acting in his personal or official capacity.
“If he spoke as a private citizen, then his First Amendment rights to free speech are protected — but he should pay for his own legal defense,” Matwijkiw said. “However, if he intended to act in a public capacity, then arguably, the taxpayers’ money can be used. But that requires substantiation: documentation, legal references, citations. Otherwise, we risk entering a conflict of interest.”
She emphasized that the “appearance of a conflict is as important as the reality,” especially when public funds are involved.

“He can’t have it both ways,” she said. “That’s why clarity on his role and intent matters.”
Matwijkiw cautioned, too, against the way the disciplinary process itself is being framed by Rokita and his legal team.
She pointed to the attorney general’s use of the term “lawfare,” a label Rokita has used to describe the commission’s actions, as an example of politicizing the legal process.
“‘Lawfare’ is becoming a trend. It’s when legal arguments are turned into a weapon to undermine the other side rather than promote justice,” Matwijkiw said. “That politicizes the process and risks eroding the rule of law.”
She added that public officials invoking distinctions between law and ethics — such as Rokita’s previous suggestion that attorney ethics rules aren’t statutory law — only deepen the problem.
“If you’re introducing a distinction between ethics and law, then there’s an even greater need to protect the law itself,” she said. “What should come first is preserving the integrity of the law — not protecting political narratives.”
What comes next
The commission has declined public comment on the pending complaint against Rokita, and the case remains before the Indiana Supreme Court.
A decision on the dismissal motion and the disciplinary commission’s new complaint is ultimately up to the high court justices.
If the charges aren’t dismissed — or if the disciplinary commission and Rokita can’t reach a settlement agreement — the justices will appoint a hearing officer to hold a public hearing on the case and hear evidence.
It would be up to the hearing officer to then issue findings and recommendations to the court, which has final say over the outcome of the case.
Sanctions depend on the seriousness of the case. Possible sanctions include a private or public reprimand; suspension from practice for a set period of time; suspension from practice with reinstatement only after the lawyer proves fitness; and permanent disbarment.
The vast majority of grievances filed with the commission are dismissed, however.

Legislative analysts predict New Mexico will have to spend hundreds of millions to address 'orphan' wells. (Getty Images)New Mexico could face ballooning costs to address oil and gas wells abandoned by operators – sometimes called “orphan wells” — and the problem is poised to get bigger, a new report said, as more wells reach the end of their lifespans
Current cleanup of 700 wells will cost $208 million and take close to a decade to complete, analysts from the Legislative Finance Committee estimated in a 47-page report released Tuesday. Future plugging of an identified 1,400 wells could cost New Mexico between $700 million dollars to as high as $1.6 billion.
“On top of that, there are more than 3,000 wells on state or private land producing extremely small quantities of oil and gas whose expected cleanup costs far exceed their predicted future revenues, increasing their risk of being orphaned,” the report says.
Unplugged oil and gas wells can pollute groundwater; pose threats to human health from wastewater or gas exposure; and can prevent further extraction from nearby wells. Private owners plug most wells, but since fiscal year 2019 the state has spent more than $50 million to plug about 1,000 orphaned wells.
Analysts recommended four policy proposals for lawmakers to incentivize oil and gas companies to address unplugged wells before they become a state problem.
They include: clarifying the definitions of abandoned and orphaned wells in the law; amending the state limits on bonds for drilling oil and gas wells to reflect cleanup costs; allowing for operators to fund cleanup through trusts; and providing state regulators the power to review or disallow the transfer of wells if the buyer can’t plug or clean them up.
Several other states adopted laws requiring operators to pay a fixed rate into trust funds for certain wells, according to Stephanie Joyce, a program evaluator for the nonpartisan Legislative Finance Committee.
“Think of it as something like a retirement account for a well, where companies put money into a fund over a well’s life, so the money is there when it is needed,” Joyce told lawmakers at a committee meeting in Taos.
Analysts also recommended the Oil Conservation Division adopt new rules to address wells at the end of their lifespan; change its bidding procedures; and adopt controls to ensure that the state is not overpaying contractors for plugging.
The report found the state’s costs for plugging wells have dramatically risen in recent years in part due to plugging deeper, more complex wells, and some inflation, but also due to procurement practices at the Oil Conservation Division.
New Mexico Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Deputy Secretary Ben Shelton called the report “fair and comprehensive,” noting that the Oil Conservation Division was not originally set up to deal with orphan wells.
“We’re a regulatory agency set up to permit the operation of the oil and gas industry in New Mexico, this is something that has become a bit of an elephant that the division is dealing with,” Shelton said.
In addition, state laws obligating oil and gas companies to pay are insufficient to meet the costs of cleanup, analysts said.
State law limits oil and gas bonds plugging wells to $250,000 for all of a company’s active wells in the state — even as the average cost to plug one well last year was $163,000. More than three dozen oil and gas operators would be required to pay less than $1,000 per well, according to the report.
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup) asked Shelton why the the Oil Conservation Division hasn’t pursued more funds from operators to reclaim public money spent on cleanup.
“The juice is not worth the squeeze,” Shelton responded. “I’m not going to send one of my three attorneys doing 100% of enforcement for the state on a two-month goose chase for a $50,000 bond — it’s just not worth the state’s taxpayer dollars.”
Shelton said he was hiring an additional attorney to help pivot to seeking assurance, but noted that it still is insufficient to pay.
Muñoz said the state was shirking its responsibilities to “go after bad actors,” and asked if the division was denying permits to operators with outstanding wells.
Shelton said state law doesn’t give the agency that power.
“The view right now is that we don’t have that sort of bad-actor review on that sort of personal compliance,” he told lawmakers. “If you start a brand-new company that has a clean bill of health and a clean record, then we don’t have the ability to come in and say ‘one of your officers has outstanding liability in another company.’”

Debra Stephens also has concerns, but her faith in the rule of law, the Constitution and the American judicial system keeps her centered and hopeful. 
Like other judges, justices and legal experts I talked to, Stephens holds a more historical perspective of our government systems. As we move deeper into the second Trump administration, you may not be able to embrace her optimism that things will turn out OK, but the data support her perspective. So far, states and advocacy organizations suing the administration over its policies and executive orders are overwhelmingly winning in court. 
America’s court system may be the only thing standing between us and the collapse of our democracy. But can it withstand relentless political pressure, a president flouting norms, and the more mundane challenge of just making sure the gears of the judiciary keep turning and cases move efficiently through the legal system?
According to The New York Times and others tracking court cases against the Trump administration, nearly 200 judicial decisions so far have halted at least temporarily the president’s initiatives. People have already died or been deported or lost their jobs because of Trump’s policies and actions, but it could be worse if the nation’s court system wasn’t as sound.
Stephens worries about courts getting bogged down in toxic public debates about socially divisive issues. But another risk to judicial independence that she flags is considerably less sexy.
“The greatest threat to judicial independence is that courts are overburdened and under-resourced. The ability to just get through those dockets with a limited number of judges is a chronic problem,” she said. 
Just taking care of everyday work is more than the current Washington courts can handle. When a big case comes onto a district court calendar, like the McCleary decision on public school funding or an upcoming adjudication of water rights in Whatcom County, the whole county may need to rewrite its court calendar and move staff and other resources around. 
Stephens said the judicial system, which represents about 0.08% of the state general fund budget, needs more money, but that’s not the whole solution. She thinks the state needs to make a broader social assessment of what we’re asking courts to do. Some things, like addiction, family unification, mental health and income insecurity, might need to move out of the courts into a different system.
Will the system be overwhelmed?
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown agrees that an overburdened judiciary could be a threat to judicial independence because it could lead to instability.
But he’s more concerned about the pressure the Trump administration could put on the system by doing things like attacking judges or calling for their impeachment.
People who would make good judges are already deciding not to pursue that career path, because of the hyper-partisan atmosphere in which they would serve. The assassination in June of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband only underscored the risks and fear public officials must confront these days.
Like Stephens, Brown remains confident in the integrity of the judicial system and doesn’t think it will be overwhelmed even as President Trump is “flooding the zone” with executive actions.
“Our court system will be fine. They’ll make it work,” he said, noting that the judiciary appears to be operating efficiently and independently. 
“And we’re winning. It’s the second quarter of the game, but we’re winning on the scoreboard,” he added. 
It’s the “next quarter” that raises concerns for Brown, his fellow attorneys general across the nation and the citizens who are paying close attention. The attorneys general are working with the courts to keep the pressure on the executive branch to make sure they follow court directives. But no one knows what the future will bring, especially if Congress doesn’t do its job to check the president.
The role of everyday Americans
Retired UW law professor Hugh D. Spitzer said one key to maintaining judicial independence is in the hands of the American people. Everyone should educate themselves about the separation of powers and let their representatives in Congress know how important an independent judiciary is to them. He and others expressed concerns about the need for more civics education and encouraged people to take advantage of any opportunity they have to serve on a jury as a great way to learn how our courts work. 
“On balance, I’m also optimistic that it’s going to work out. But you have to be vigilant,” he said.
Like all the people I interviewed for this story, Spitzer had a nuanced opinion on whether electing or appointing judges was better for judicial independence. But they all agreed that both approaches include some political pressure on those who hold the gavel. Longer periods between elections help with independence, they also agreed. Spitzer added that public financing of judicial races is better than expecting judges to raise money for their campaigns. This seems pretty obvious.
We’ve seen the way judges appointed by Republican presidents, including Trump himself, are stopping some of the current president’s executive orders. This is judicial independence working well: with judges focusing on the law and the Constitution and ignoring political pressures.
Both the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, John Roberts, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, have spoken out recently about the need for judicial independence and have criticized the president’s statements to the contrary. 
“Judicial independence is crucial,” Roberts said at a May gathering of judges and lawyers in Buffalo, New York. He praised the constitutional concept of the three co-equal branches of government. “That innovation doesn’t work if the judiciary is not independent,” he said.
In a talk at the Georgetown Law School in March, Sotomayor agreed with Spitzer that educating the public about the importance of judicial independence. 
“More than ever, we have to get up and explain and repeat and explain again why judicial independence is critical to everyone’s freedom,” Sotomayor said in response to a question about the role of courts in addressing growing challenges to the rule of law. “Once we lose our common norms, we’ve lost the rule of law completely. So it’s going back to figuring out what those are,” she added.
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, nominated by President Joe Biden, recently warned at a conference of judges and lawyers about the danger of attacking judges for doing their jobs, as Trump has done, although she did not name the president in her comments. 
Hints from history
Judge Ketu Shah, presiding judge of King County Superior Court, said this moment in U.S. history will pressure test the judicial branch, but he thinks the courts are up for the test. 
He’s been thinking a lot about an 1803 Supreme Court decision, Marbury v. Madison, that made the judicial system what it is today by establishing the right of the courts to rule on the constitutionality of actions by the other two branches of government. 
“The chief justice at the time was very worried about judicial independence but not wanting to offend the current president, Thomas Jefferson,” Shah said. That decision set up the independence of the judiciary, which was essential to keeping the fledgling American system moving in the right direction then and now. “The reason our government has been successful all of these years are the checks and balances between the different branches. We need to hold on to that.”
He drew from history again to talk about another concern. Because even judges are human beings, they will make mistakes (and have made some that many of us could list). The question is: Will they be able to fix them? Shah raises as an example of how mistakes by the judicial system can be fixed, the Dred Scott decision, or Dred Scott v. Sandford, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1857 that slavery was OK. 
That decision, considered by many to be the worst ever from the Supreme Court, was overturned by the 13th and 14th amendments to the Constitution, which abolished slavery and declared all persons born in the United States to be U.S. citizens, with the same rights. In other words: birthright citizenship, which is currently being debated again in the courts. 
Shah said he thinks the courts are being serious and sober about their role right now, but like the others I interviewed, he’s worried about the tone of political debate affecting the courts and our system of government more generally.
“I wonder what will happen in the future if the amplified voices help people forget the importance of checks and balances,” he said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Gavel-GettyImages-876701606-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

(Screengrab via Uthmeier's X account)Last week, Florida’s recently appointed attorney general, James Uthmeier, announced that he had a pretty snazzy idea: Build the state’s biggest immigrant detention center in the middle of the Everglades and call it “Alligator Alcatraz.” (Presumably “Gator Guantánamo” was already taken.)
“You don’t need to invest that much in the perimeter. People get out, there’s not that much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons,” Uthmeier said in a video he posted on X. “Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.”
I predict Uthmeier’s next brainstorm will call for transforming Marjory Stoneman Douglas’ historic home in Coconut Grove into a big public urinal. For toilet paper, he will no doubt provide copies of Florida’s Government in the Sunshine Law.
This week the state began building the prison, rushing the project while ducking questions the same way Gov. Ron DeSantis tried to duck the public last year while rushing construction of golf courses, hotels, and pickleball courts in state parks.
The official designation for the detention site is TNT, by the way — the governor should take care that this project doesn’t blow up in his face like his parks plan did.)
As with the failed state parks scheme, pretty much every environmental group in Florida has been screaming bloody murder about it. Watching them reminded me of that scene in “Airplane!” when everyone lines up for a turn to slap one hysterical passenger. It’s clear they’d like to give Uthmeier the same treatment, along with the guy who appointed him.

Hundreds of people turned out Sunday afternoon for a protest at the site off U.S. 41, waving signs that said things like “NO ICE IN THE EVERGLADES.” Even as they protested, though, they could see work was already starting.

The crowd of protesters included Miccosukee tribal elder Betty Osceola, acclaimed nature photographer Clyde Butcher, often called “the Ansel Adams of Florida,” and the daughter of a legendary NFL quarterback who helped lead opposition to DeSantis’ golf course ploy.
This protest “was less about the kind of facility and more about the location of the facility,” said Jessica Namath, daughter of “Broadway Joe” Namath. “I mean, is anything sacred anymore?”
Namath wasn’t just talking about the fact that the Miccosukee Tribe opposes the prison because it’s adjacent to land the tribe regards as sacred. No, the site Uthmeier and DeSantis have picked for their Alligator Alcatraz happens to be one of the most holy places in Florida’s environmental history.
That lonely 10,500-foot-long airstrip is the reason Big Cypress National Preserve exists all around it. It’s the reason writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas became, at age 79, an environmental crusader for the rest of her 108 years of life.
 It’s the place where Miami officials tried to build the world’s largest jetport. They figured that by putting it in the middle of a swamp, no angry neighbors would object.
Boy, were they wrong.
 ‘A new city’
In 1968, the Dade County Port Authority acquired a 39-square mile parcel just six miles north of Everglades National Park and laid out plans for runways six miles long where jets would take off every minute.
For easy access to the site from either side of Florida, they proposed new interstate highway and a high-speed transit system (this is where fans of “The Simpsons” should start chanting, “Monorail!”). There would even be a “recreational waterway” for airboats.
Authority officials saw this massive investment of tax dollars as a way to set off an explosion of private development in what they viewed as a soggy and valueless land.
“A new city is going to rise up in the middle of Florida,” the authority chairman boasted.
Imagine his surprise when an odd coalition formed to oppose this supposedly foolproof plan. Hunters, anglers, high school students, Native Americans, and birdwatchers all said, “Whoa, that’s a terrible idea!”
Thriller writer and Sarasota resident John D. MacDonald even weighed in, writing in “Life” magazine that the jetport would “kill what was left of the Everglades.”
The most politically savvy opponent, Joe Browder, approached Douglas about joining the fight. After all, she’d written THE book on the Everglades. Surely, she wanted to save it.
She demurred, telling Browder nobody would listen to a half-blind old lady like her. They would only pay attention to organizations.
“Well,” Browder asked, “why don’t you start an organization?”
Together, Douglas and Browder founded Friends of the Everglades. (Yes, that venerable organization is in the thick of the current fight too.)
  Marjory Stoneman Douglas via Florida State Archives
“It was that project that drove Marjory into the ranks of active environmentalists,” said Jack Davis, who wrote the definitive biography of this Florida icon.
She knew that the Everglades wasn’t just vital habitat for panthers and gators, Davis said: “She knew that the Everglades recharges the Biscayne Aquifer where South Florida gets its water supply. She made the connection between the ecological health of the Everglades and the quality of human life in South Florida.”
This week, when Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava wrote to state officials posing lots of questions about the Alligator Alcatraz project, she brought that up too: “As a longtime champion of our Everglades and clean drinking water, I am committed to ensuring we continue to provide bipartisan protections for our greatest natural resource.”
Douglas’ greatest ally turned out to be science with a capital S. But, as has often happened during the DeSantis administration, science seems to be getting short shrift this time around.
 The first impact statement
To gauge the ramifications of building a giant jetport in the Everglades, a team from the U.S. Geological Survey put together the nation’s first environmental impact statement.
They were led by a senior scientist named Luna Leopold, the son of “A Sand County Almanac” author Aldo Leopold.
Their analysis found that the jetport would produce 4 million gallons of sewage and 1.5 million gallons of industrial waste every day, plus scatter 10,000 tons of air pollution across the natural landscape. When you added in all the related development, the numbers ballooned.
Nathaniel Reed, then a top aide to Gov. Claude Kirk, used the USGS report to convince his boss to withdraw the state’s support. That led to President Richard Nixon canceling federal support too, which ended the jetport before it got off the ground.
Then, under Nixon’s successor, Gerald Ford, the feds spent $150 million to buy up Big Cypress and turn it into the nation’s first-ever preserve.
Thus, we can thank three Republican politicians — Kirk, Nixon, and Ford — for halting the jetport and preserving a big swamp, Davis pointed out.
But that pro-conservation Republican Party seems to be a thing of the past now.
 Crossing his fingers
The first thing most people knew about this push for a big detention center in our most famous marsh came June 19, when Uthmeier posted about it on X.
That’s hardly the proper forum for alerting the public to a major Florida land-use change, but apparently that’s DeSantis’ preferred method.
Uthmeier’s post emphasized the lonely airstrip, calling it “an old, virtually abandoned facility” that could be used for flying detainees in and out.
Actually, the only thing that’s been abandoned is the pretense that DeSantis cares about fixing the Everglades.
“I’m proud to keep advancing these efforts in Everglades restoration and water quality, which will have lasting benefits to our state for years to come,” he said six months ago. Guess he had his fingers crossed when he spoke those words.
On Wednesday, in his first public comments on the Alligator Alcatraz controversy, DeSantis insisted that adding so many humans and manmade infrastructure to the Everglades will have “zero effect” on the River of Grass, and insisted all the environmental groups and others objecting to the project were just using it as a pretext because they disagree with his anti-immigration stance.
This isn’t just an environmental concern. Last year, the state and federal government earmarked more than $1 billion for restoring the River of Grass, on top of the $5 billion or so spent over the past 20 years. That’s all wasted taxpayer money now, poured down a really big drain.
A study last week found that a healthy Everglades is worth more than $31 billion to the South Florida economy every year. Real estate, tourism, fisheries, and recreation all benefit, the study reported.
Sorry folks, DeSantis is saying, we only support the lock-em-up business now. We can’t do anything to help other Everglades-related industries.
If this DeSantis scheme is disastrous for you, perhaps you can apply to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for help — assuming FEMA still exists.
 Tents in hurricane season
Speaking of FEMA, how about that brilliant plan to house more than 1,000 detainees (plus all their guards) in tents and trailers in a remote area with a single road in and out during hurricane season.
And on property that, according to the Miami mayor’s letter, consists of 96% wetlands.
This turned into the topic of a lively discussion at this week’s Collier County Commission meeting.
Although the airstrip has belonged to Miami-Dade for decades, the detention center sits in Collier. The commissioners made it plain they’d been blindsided by the state like everyone else and wanted nothing to do with whatever happens when the next Ian storms ashore.
  Collier County Commissioner Rick LoCastro, via Collier County website
“Sitting here in the middle of hurricane season, I sure would hate to see this plop in our lap,” Commissioner Rick LoCastro said. “A thousand detainees that were sitting in tents [and] now need food, shelter, transportation, and all that.”
“You’re spot on, because even [the land] in between the taxiways is quite low and quite wet,” agreed county emergency management director Dan Sherman. “The contractors are going to have their hands full with anything temporary, even on a good day during the rainy season.”
Hey, maybe the contractors building the site are using undocumented immigrants for all the hot and sweaty construction work. After all, that’s the way we do construction here in Florida.
 Environmental harm
Sherman told the Collier commissioners that state officials had first visited the airstrip in February, but didn’t tell anyone what they were up to.
“It’s a location we’ve been looking at with law enforcement for a while,” Uthmeier told right-wing podcaster Benny “I Swear I Didn’t Know I Was Being Paid Handsomely for Spreading Russian Propaganda” Johnson this week.
He called the swampy site a low-cost alternative to an actual prison and bragged, “As of this morning, the federal government has approved our detention facility plan. … We’ll have 5,000 beds out there by early July.”
Uthmeier didn’t mention anything about consulting environmental experts about the prison’s effect on the Everglades. It’s too bad, because there are likely to be plenty.
  Eve Samples, via Friends of the Everglades
“Negative environmental impacts would include wetland degradation, building construction (even if temporary), water and sewer facilities, light pollution, traffic and emergency services,” Eve Samples, the current executive director of Friends of the Everglades, wrote in a letter to DeSantis. So far, he hasn’t responded, and I bet he never will.
  Kevin Guthrie via Florida Division of Environmental Management
The letter that state Emergency Management Division Director Kevin Guthrie sent to Miami-Dade and Collier officials over the weekend doesn’t mention any of that stuff. Instead, it simply urges the two counties to “work collaboratively … to complete the transaction in an expedient manner.”
The letter shows Guthrie failed to do his homework. He didn’t know who the Collier commission chair was, or that Collier had no claim on the airstrip. He also thought $20 million would be a good price for the property, apparently unaware that recent appraisals said it’s worth $190 million.
Instead of negotiating, the state just swooped in and seized the property on Monday. As justification, Guthrie cited a two-year-old emergency declaration from DeSantis that claimed immigrants are a dire threat to the state — not the boon that farmers, construction companies, and hotel managers know them to be.
The premise of our huge state and federal immigration crackdown — 3,000 arrests a day! — is the implied promise that the detainees will be evil drug dealers, human traffickers, and violent gangbangers. Instead, we’re seeing ICE scoop up an evangelical pastor in Wimauma, a breast-feeding mom in Orlando, and even a born-in-America U.S. citizen in Leon County.
Now picture those poor folks having to sleep in a tent in the Everglades in the heat of summer, fending off skeeters while squishing through the mud to use a Port-A-Potty, fleeing in terror as a hurricane bears down.
Fortunately, I think the opponents of this Gator Gulag have a secret weapon to stop it.
It’s Uthmeier.

 Mr. Oopsie-Daisy
No one voted for Uthmeier. DeSantis appointed him attorney general to reward him for doing such a bang-up job running the governor’s failed presidential campaign.
In his short time in office, he’s already earned the dubious distinction of being the only Florida attorney general to be found in contempt of court.
He also did such a terrific job running the campaign to defeat the ballot initiative to legalize weed that he embroiled both DeSantis and his wife in the Hope Florida scandal (or as I like to call it, “Hope Florida Doesn’t Notice”). One Florida House Republican even accused Uthmeier of fraud and money laundering, and now there’s a criminal investigation.
Before that, as DeSantis’ chief of staff, Uthmeier coordinated the program that fooled asylum-seekers in Texas into boarding taxpayer-funded flights to Martha’s Vineyard. That stunt backfired spectacularly when those immigrants were granted visas as crime victims.
My point is that Uthmeier has been a colossal jinx for DeSantis. He’s a human whoopie cushion, a pratfall waiting to happen. I’m surprised his nickname isn’t “Oopsie-Daisy” Uthmeier.
Who knows? With his track record, maybe we’ll accidentally wind up with enough money to fully restore the Everglades the way we’ve been trying to do for 25 years. I think Marjory would like that.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dade-County-airstrip-in-Ochopee-via-screen-grab-from-Uthmeiers-X-account-1024x501.png,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)The Democratic Attorneys General Association is putting big money behind Jay Jones, announcing Thursday a $1 million investment in his campaign to flip Virginia’s attorney general seat and restore Democratic control of the office.
“Jones is a committed public servant who has always put his constituents and their rights first, which is why DAGA is excited to make this early investment to flip the seat back to blue,” the group said in a statement.
The high-dollar move came just one day after the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), the party’s national arm for state legislative races, announced a $400,000 boost to Democratic House of Delegates candidates and a new wave of endorsements in competitive districts. 
The back-to-back funding announcements signal a coordinated national effort to reclaim power in Virginia, where Republicans currently hold all three statewide offices and Democrats remain in control of both chambers of the legislature. 
DAGA President Sean Rankin said the time to act is now, casting Jones as a critical check on recent Republican policies, particularly those of President Donald Trump. 
“Virginia needs an attorney general like Jones who will hold Trump accountable for his unlawful actions,” Rankin said. “Jay Jones is running a campaign to defend democracy and fight for Virginia families, and we are confident he will deliver for the commonwealth as the next attorney general.”
With “so much at stake,” Rankin added, “it’s vital we take back this seat in November, and we’re committed to working with Jones to make that happen.”
Jones, a former state delegate from Norfolk and the son of the late Judge Jerrauld C. Jones, won the Democratic nomination last week after narrowly defeating Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor in a hard-fought primary. 
The victory marked a political comeback for Jones, who previously lost the 2021 Democratic nomination for attorney general to then-incumbent Mark Herring. In November, Jones hopes to unseat Republican Jason Miyares.
A graduate of UVA and the University of Virginia School of Law, Jones has focused his campaign on reproductive rights, voting access, criminal justice reform and standing up to what he describes as “an increasingly extreme Republican agenda” at both the state and federal levels. He has said that Virginia’s next attorney general must be prepared to challenge legal efforts to roll back civil liberties and democratic protections.
The $1 million investment is one of the largest early commitments DAGA has made this cycle and underscores the strategic importance of the Virginia race. Attorney general contests have become a national battleground for policy fights ranging from abortion and gun rights to election law and corporate regulation.
Meanwhile, the DLCC’s newly endorsed candidates include Lindsey Dougherty, who’s challenging Republican Del. Carrie Coyner in the 75th District; Leslie Mehta, taking on Del. Mark Earley Jr. in the 89th; May Nivar, running against Del. David Owen in the 57th; and Kacey Robins Carnegie, vying for an open seat in Hampton Roads after GOP Del. Baxter Ennis opted not to seek re-election.
All four won their primaries last week and are now seen as key players in the battle for control of the House. The DLCC described the candidates as part of a broader strategy to “move Virginia forward” and flip seats Democrats narrowly lost in previous cycles.
Virginia’s 2025 election is shaping up to be a high-stakes test for both parties, with all three statewide offices — governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general — on the ballot, alongside the entire 100-member House of Delegates. 
With national figures and outside money pouring into the commonwealth, the contests are likely to preview messaging and strategy ahead of the 2026 midterms.

Twelve jurors had found Marvin Rice guilty of murdering his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend. But they could not unanimously agree on whether he should live or die. Missouri is one of two states where a judge gets the final say when jurors can’t agree on the punishment — even when they vote 11 to 1 for life, as they had in Rice’s case.
He then sentenced Rice to death.
“It was a very lonely and daunting position to be in,” Parker, now a defense attorney in south-central Missouri, told The Marshall Project – St. Louis recently. 

This article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project – St. Louis, a nonprofit news team covering Missouri’s criminal justice systems. Subscribe to their email list, and follow The Marshall Project on Instagram, Reddit and YouTube.

Defendants were previously sentenced to life without parole when Missouri jurors deadlocked in a capital case. That’s the default most states with the death penalty use today. A few conduct a new penalty phase. Since Missouri changed its law in 1984, Rice is one of at least 18 people who have been sentenced to death by a judge. Four of them have been executed. 
Missouri is an outlier in allowing judges to impose death. Some say judges have a better legal understanding of the death penalty than juries and argue that some crimes are so heinous that death is appropriate even when a jury isn’t unanimous. Opponents say the process undermines the importance of juries and that one person should not decide life or death. They also say the way Missouri’s statute is written is unconstitutional. 
“It is an issue that remains an issue,” said Robert Dunham, an attorney and director of the Death Penalty Policy Project.
There’s also a racial component when it comes to the death penalty in Missouri. Of the 18 people sentenced by judges, 11 — or 61% — were Black. Forty-one percent of all the defendants sent to death row in the state were Black, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center. That is dramatically disproportionate in a state where 11.7% of the population is Black, according to U.S. Census data.
Rice was later resentenced to life without parole on account of other violations in his case, including comments from the prosecution that infringed on Rice’s Fifth Amendment rights referencing his decision not to testify. 
 From death row to life

The jury in Joseph Whitfield’s 1994 trial in St. Louis also voted 11 to 1 for life in prison without parole. 
Whitfield’s life was spared after the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Ring v. Arizona, which ruled in 2002 that only a jury can decide on facts necessary to impose the death penalty. In Whitfield’s case, the Missouri Supreme Court said jurors must first agree on two categories of facts to impose death: the presence of an aggravating circumstance and that it outweighs any mitigating factors. These steps would continue to be a source of legal disputes in life-or-death decisions for years to come.
In the third and final step, the so-called mercy step, jurors decide if they still want to impose death. That can be carried out by jurors or, if they cannot agree, a judge. 
In several Missouri cases where a judge had been the decider, it wasn’t clear where jurors hit a roadblock in the process or what aggravators and mitigators they had discussed.
Execution date set for man sentenced to die by a Missouri judge over 2005 murder

Eleven of the 18 judge-imposed death sentences have been changed to life. Most were a cascading consequence of Ring and Missouri’s subsequent decision for Whitfield, who died in prison on May 26 at age 85, according to the Missouri Department of Corrections. 
Among them was Deandra Buchanan. In March 2002, he was found guilty of fatally shooting his aunt, girlfriend and stepfather. The jury could not agree on a sentence. 
The judge handed down death.
He was resentenced to life without parole by the Missouri Supreme Court in the wake of the Ring decision. He was not present when the court revisited his case. In September 2024, public defender Tyler Coyle filed a motion arguing Buchanan’s life sentence was invalid because he had a right to be in court. 
A judge denied the motion on June 16. Coyle said he will appeal. 
 A recent execution

Amber McLaughlin was sentenced to death by St. Louis County Circuit Judge Steven Goldman in November 2006. McLaughlin became the first openly transgender person to be executed in the U.S. when she died by lethal injection on Jan. 3, 2023. 
Before becoming a judge, Goldman — then a prosecutor — helped devise the law that gave judges the power to impose death sentences.
Other states have moved to limit judicial death sentences. In a 2016 decision from the Supreme Court of Delaware, the justices said the state’s capital punishment statute was unconstitutional because it allowed judges to make findings on the aggravating circumstances and weigh those against mitigators. The ruling ended the death penalty in Delaware. Only Missouri and Indiana continue to permit a judge to impose death when a jury is hung. Indiana is less active when it comes to capital punishment, having executed 15 people since 2000. Missouri has executed 60, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center.
Goldman said judges have more familiarity with the death penalty. 
“I think judges are well qualified to do it, probably more so than juries in that regard,” he said. 
Retired Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Wolff said the right to a jury trial is fundamental. 
“Especially in death penalty cases, but in every case that jurors hear, the jury is, among other things, a conscience of the community,” Wolff said. 
As McLaughlin’s execution date approached, Wolff and six retired circuit judges wrote to then-Gov. Mike Parson, urging him to commute McLaughlin’s sentence to life without parole. They said her sentence had been reversed in 2016 because her trial attorney failed to present information about her mental health. That mitigating evidence could have tipped the scales when the jury couldn’t agree. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals later overturned the 2016 decision. 
When Goldman sentenced McLaughlin, he acknowledged there were conflicting rules and said it wasn’t clear what mitigating circumstances were considered by the jury, according to court transcripts. 
Larry Komp, a federal public defender who represented McLaughlin in her appeals, said he didn’t think the court’s actions were constitutional. 
“But I guess it is in Missouri,” he said. 
The Missouri Supreme Court itself has noted the importance of juries in death penalty cases. In denying a stay for Kevin Johnson before he was executed in 2022, the court emphasized that the jury had found the aggravators, weighed them and decided on death. 
If officials genuinely believed in juries, Komp said, “Amber wouldn’t have been executed.” 
 Waiting on death row

Missouri has cleared much of its death row, primarily through a steady stream of executions that picked up as the pandemic waned. The state carried out four executions in 2023 and another four in 2024. Craig Wood, 57, and Lance Shockley, 48, are two of the eight people remaining. Both were sentenced by judges. 
During an appeal in Wood’s case, the Missouri Supreme Court backtracked on the three-step process juries go through. Now, a jury only has to unanimously agree on the presence of an aggravator.
Several attorneys said they doubt questions about the process authorizing judge-imposed death sentences would be taken up by the courts again. That leaves it up to the Missouri Legislature. 
In the past eight years, at least 14 pieces of legislation were drafted to repeal the law allowing judges to impose the death penalty. Most were sponsored by Republicans. 
Another bill to repeal the law got a hearing this year in the Senate, where it was debated for over 90 minutes. It was sponsored by state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold.
“It is my firm belief that one person in the state of Missouri should not hold the power of the state to kill somebody,” she said during Senate debate.

Get rid of states? Legal scholar Stephen Legomsky, who taught for 34 years at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, has just published a book, “Reimagining the American Union,” that proposes a radical idea: Abolish state government. The Conversation’s politics and democracy editor, Naomi Schalit – a former statehouse reporter herself – interviewed Legomsky about the provocative idea behind his book, in which he advocates moving most of the functions of state government down to the local level, closer to those represented and governed by it.
 You propose abolishing states. Why?

The book is a thought experiment. The proposal I’m offering is long term. I realize we need states during the current political moment.
I think the states are the root cause of many, if not most, of the current dangers faced by U.S. democracy. I also see the states as a significant source of fiscal waste. We don’t need three levels of government – national, state and local – all regulating us and all taxing us. Two would do just fine. And after careful, detailed analysis, I concluded that every benefit ever claimed for state government could be achieved at least as well, and in many cases better, by the local governments.
 I’m imagining the framers sitting in Independence Hall. And you go back in time and suggest to them not having states. I think most of them would drop dead at the thought, because it ultimately implies a much more powerful federal government. What would you say to them?

After they stop laughing, I would emphasize that I’m not proposing a wholesale transfer of power from the states to an all-powerful, all-knowing central government. Yes, some of the functions currently performed by the states could better be performed at the national level, but I’m proposing that the lion’s share devolve down to the local governments, which are even closer to the people they represent than the state legislatures can ever be.
Some of the most ardent Federalists, including Alexander Hamilton and James Wilson, referred to the states as “artificial beings” or “imaginary beings.” They accepted the states only because keeping them was politically essential to getting the required nine state ratifications, not because they thought states were a good idea.
 What functions would your plan hand over to the federal government?

A prime example is licensing. I looked up all the different occupations that require state licenses. I was astonished: practically every health care profession, barbers, engineers, lawyers, architects, the list is endless.
If you live near a state line, you can’t practice in both states unless you get two licenses. If you move to another state, you have to get another license. This seems silly. The human anatomy, human hair, engineering principles, don’t change as you cross from New York to New Jersey. Nor do we need 50 different state driver’s licenses; a single national license administered through local agencies would be more efficient.
 You say states are the root cause of the greatest threats to American democracy. What are those threats?

The structural threats are those that are baked into the Constitution itself. The Electoral College is one. On five occasions, the Electoral College has awarded the presidency to the candidate whom the voters rejected nationwide. And there were many, many near misses where the popular vote loser almost became president, making many such future instances a statistical certainty.
Perhaps even more important, every state, no matter how large or how small, gets the same number of U.S. senators. In fact, a majority of the U.S. population is represented by only about 18% of the Senate. The minority gets the other 82%.
These counter-majoritarian defects in the elections of both presidents and senators have a ripple effect. They skew the composition, and thus the decisions, of the federal courts. Three of the current Supreme Court justices were appointed by President Donald Trump after he had lost the national popular vote; five of the current Supreme Court justices were confirmed by senators who collectively represented only a minority of the U.S. population.
Here’s one especially jarring statistic: From 1969 until today, the Democratic presidential nominees won the national popular vote in a slight majority of the elections. Yet, during the presidential terms that resulted from those elections, Republican presidents have gotten to make 15 of the 20 Supreme Court appointments.
The Constitution also gives the states broad powers to regulate and run national elections. State legislatures have used those powers to pass gerrymandering, voter suppression and other counter-majoritarian laws.
 If you devolve these functions and services to localities, wouldn’t you end up with a mirror of the current state-level structure? Wouldn’t this just send a lot of state personnel down to the local level?

Yes, much of that structure would devolve. However, I see that as a good thing. Devolution is unavoidable in a country this size. Not everything can be done by the central government. The question for me is, do we need two levels of subordinate political subdivisions or one? One seems more efficient. And when problems are too big for one local government to handle on its own, it can partner with other local governments or with the national government, just as many local governments do today.
 If there were no states to gerrymander or pass voter-suppression laws, wouldn’t some national government agency just do it instead?

Redistricting would be performed by a nonpartisan redistricting commission that I propose be made up of technicians, mainly demographers, statisticians and geographers, under broad, general principles enacted by Congress. That’s what almost every other democracy in the world does today.
 Why did you write this book?

For a long time, I’ve been distressed about so many of the dangers to our democracy. So, one day, I found myself compiling what ended up becoming a fairly long mental list of all of my democracy-related grievances.
 A list of grievances like in the Declaration of Independence!

That’s a nice analogy. And as I thought about that list, it suddenly struck me that the vast majority of these problems couldn’t occur without states. That got me thinking about whether we really need states in the first place.
 If it’s just a thought experiment, something that’s not going to happen, why would you think it’s worthwhile spending time writing this?

And why would I be so vain as to think anybody would want to waste their time reading it?
 And your answer is, ‘Because I’m an academic!’

It’s that, plus more. I do hope there’s some scholarly value in this. But I’m also writing for the long term. States are secure for now, but history teaches us that the more distant future is full of surprises.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Montanans cherish our wide-open spaces because they are the backbone of our economy, the spectacular beauty that makes Montana special, and the shared birthright of every American.

So when Sen. Steve Daines quietly collaborated with Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to slip an amendment into the so-called “big beautiful bill” that would have forced the sale of as many as 3 million acres of public land and opened approximately 250 million more to auction, they weren’t proposing “budget savings.” They were engineering the largest transfer of wealth from taxpayers to wealthy private interests in American history.

Daines proudly messaged Montana would be exempt—knowing another member of Congress could add it back in at any time. His office never produced a single safeguard to prevent it. Make no mistake: Daines signed off on a plan to slice up America’s outdoor legacy for hedge funds, developers and foreign mining conglomerates.

Only after after a wave of public outrage from wildlife and land conservationists, hikers, campers, anglers, hunters, and recreation businesses and the Senate Parliamentarian ruled the amendment extraneous under the Byrd Rule—did Daines reverse course. This was not an act of accountability. It was damage control. Had the parliamentarian ruled the other way—or had the scheme remained under the radar—Daines would have proceeded with his scheme.

Equally troubling is Sen. Tim Sheehy’s complicity.

While Montanans flooded phone lines to protect our lands, Sheehy only offered support for the broader bill. His failure to promptly oppose Daines’ land-sale scheme speaks volumes about where he stands when corporate donors clash with Montana’s values and economy.

The amendment would have erased habitat for wolves, elk, wolverines, grizzlies, Canada lynx, and hundreds of other species, and fast-tracked drilling and logging. It would have undercut an economy that depends on healthy, accessible landscape that generates billions annually. Every acre siphoned into private hands would be one less for the average camper, hunter or mountain biker seeking solitude under big skies.

Daines hopes voters will only blame Sen. Lee. But Montanans—and all Americans who treasure public lands—must never forget or forgive his egregious co-authorship to liquidate the public trust. Trust is earned through consistent action based on values, not reversals and rewritten press releases. If Daines and Lee find a loophole to the Byrd Rule, the next land-grab could appear at 2 a.m. on the last pages of a must-pass bill.

Moving forward we must demand permanent protections. Congress must pass legislation with a clear and permanent “no-sale” clause for our public lands—no loopholes, no carve-outs. Public lands, no matter their location, belong to all of us.

We must also hold Daines and Sheehy accountable. Don’t let Daines off the hook for co-authoring a massive public land giveaway. Don’t forget Sheehy’s attempt to distract from his complicity by pointing to Montana’s temporary carve-out—while still praising the amended bill.

If ever there was a time to support conservation groups, it’s now. We are out-funded by special interest dark money groups and their lobbyists. Keep calling, writing, and showing up. Politicians count on our exhaustion. Prove them wrong.

Public lands are our inheritance. The BBB land-sale fiasco showed just how close we came to losing them. Vigilance and public outcry defeated greed this time. Let’s make sure Senators like Daines and Sheehy—beholden to the wealthy and special interests—never get another chance to steal our land from us again.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-31-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 07:01:20.476403

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Dallen Michael Greene still remembers the fear he felt when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1999.
“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
 Living longer

People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.










The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares


“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.
Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
 Uncertain grants

Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.
Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”
Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help toshore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
 Skipping pills

In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.
“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin is calling on the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office to reconsider plans to adopt the use of facial recognition technology. Like the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), the sheriff’s office is considering acquiring facial recognition technology from the company Biometrica. The company has offered MPD free access in exchange for 2.5 million images, jail records, and other related data of people who have passed through Milwaukee’s criminal justice system, including many who presumably haven’t been convicted of a crime. 
“Given all the public opposition we’ve seen to the Milwaukee Police Department’s push to expand their use of facial recognition, the news of the Sheriffs office’s interest in acquiring this technology is deeply concerning,” Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director for the ACLU of Wisconsin, wrote in a statement for an ACLU press release. “Law enforcement’s use of facial recognition software poses a number of serious threats to civil rights and civil liberties, making it dangerous both when it fails and when it functions.” 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Just days ago, Milwaukee County Sheriff Denita Ball revealed that her office was looking into adopting facial recognition software. Ball told county supervisors during a June 17 meeting of the Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and General Services Committee Urban Milwaukee reported, that she was assessing a data-sharing agreement for the technology. MCSO did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Like MPD, the sheriff’s office is exploring an agreement with Biometrica, a company which has pushed back against concerns about privacy and the use of its surveillance tools. Biometrica offers a third-party facial recognition algorithm to agencies like the Milwaukee police and the sheriff’s office. The sheriff’s office states that rather than using the technology for untargeted surveillance, it aims to use facial recognition software to identify people once investigators have an image of a criminal suspect. Ball says that facial recognition would never be the sole basis for an arrest or charges, Urban Milwaukee reported.
On Thursday, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors will vote on a resolution requiring the creation of a regulatory process for adopting facial recognition technology. Both at the county and city government meetings, however, law enforcement agencies have been met with public skepticism about their exploration of facial recognition technologies. 
Tension bubbled up during a hearing before the Milwaukee Equal Rights Commission last week. Police department Inspector Paul Lough  said that facial recognition could provide important leads for investigations similar to those derived from confidential informants and information databases used to run names. During the hearing, MPD officials presented examples of cases in which facial recognition technology helped solve crimes. “Whether or not they would’ve…may or may not have been solved without the use of facial rec., it’s hard to say,” said Lough. “Some probably would have been, some might still be open. But the important part of it is that all of the ones that we’re going to go over are very predatory in nature where there’s exigent circumstances to solve them quickly.”

MPD Capt. James Hutchinson went over two investigations from March 2024 which utilized facial recognition technology. One involved a drive-by shooting, where a passing car opened fire on a pedestrian, who died on the scene. Hutchinson explained that MPD obtained images from surveillance cameras, which were then sent to partner agencies with the ability to run facial recognition requests. Within 16 hours, the police captain told the commission, a potential suspect had been identified. 
“We don’t know who they are when we get those pictures back, but we have ways of vetting that information, confirming the identification provided to us,” said Hutchinson. “And that’s what we did in this case.” Unique tattoos helped narrow the search to a man who was wearing a GPS bracelet. When officers went to conduct an arrest, they found two alleged shooters, their guns and the car they are believed to have used. Hutchinson said that a trial is pending for both suspects arrested in that case. 
Facial recognition was also used in a sexual assault case, which occurred two days before the shooting. A victim had been followed home in the rain by a man offering her his umbrella, and asking for money. He mentioned that he’d already tried asking for money at a nearby gas station. As they walked, he held a gun to her head and forced her into a garage where he assaulted her. Officers were able to locate the garage with the victim’s help using Google Maps, and later the gas station the man had mentioned before. Surveillance camera photos potentially capturing the man were sent to other agencies for facial recognition assistance, which came back with images of a man who was on probation for sexual assault. He was identified both by the probation agent and the victim, and was sentenced to 20 years of incarceration. 
MPD listed 13 additional cases where it used facial recognition, including a string of taco truck robberies on Milwaukee’s South Side involving a group of masked assailants. Although they appeared careful to cover their faces, one suspect let his mask down briefly, which was seen by a camera, and sent to a partner agency for identification. In that case, three to four potential suspects were identified by the technology, each with a certain percentage of certainty such as 97%, 95% and so on. After further investigation, detectives identified those responsible for the taco truck robberies as people flagged by the  facial recognition search with the lowest percentage of certainty.

During public testimony, several people expressed concerns about the accuracy of facial recognition technology. Facial recognition software has been shown to have trouble identifying non-white faces, and is prone to errors particularly when identifying people of color. Some feared that defendants might have trouble learning how facial recognition was used in their cases, and felt that police oversight was lacking. Others pointed to the 2.5 million images MPD would give to Biometrica in exchange for the software licenses, and argued that such a move would only further harm community trust in the police. Because the images include mugshots, it’s possible that people whose images were included in that transaction will not be convicted of a crime after being  arrested or detained at the jail for a period of time. Other questions included  what access federal agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), would have to MPD’s facial recognition system. 
“As we recently found, MPD has been using facial recognition technology on the faces of Milwaukeeans for years, without being transparent with the public or the FPC,” Krissie Fung, a member of the Milwaukee Turners and Milwaukee’s Fire and Police Commission (FPC), said during public testimony. “Because there’s no standard operating procedure to provide guidelines around their process, relying on MPD to follow their own gentlemen’s agreements and internal process is just not how oversight works.” 
Fung also said MPD Chief Jeffrey Norman acknowledged when he was reappointed that there is no way to guarantee the safety of the data and faces of Milwaukeeans, and that the data would be going to a third-party company the city does not oversee and which uses algorithms the city will not be able to  access. “MPD’s proposal is to trade 2.5 million mugshots in exchange for this license which, by the way, includes my mugshot,” said Fung. “I believe that there are serious legal concerns that have not yet played out in the courts, and that would open us up to significant lawsuits.”

“I cannot help but wonder if the reason Biometrica is so thirsty to trade 2.5 million ‘jail records or mugshots’ in exchange for free access to this technology, is that they assume that those jail records are Black faces, and they clearly need more Black faces to train their inaccurate algorithm,” Fung added. “But we don’t need to let them get those Black faces from Milwaukee.”
“I don’t know a single person in this city that trusts the police,” said Ron Jansen, who has testified about law enforcement at previous city and county meetings. “So the last thing Milwaukee needs to do is hand this department a tool that creates even greater opportunity to harm the people of this city.” 
“This is not free,” Jansen added.  “… the cost is 2.5 million mugshots of residents, non-residents, whatever. Anybody who’s been through the system here in Milwaukee…2.5 million human beings…Human beings, maybe half of which or more, were never convicted of a crime. This includes people who were wrongfully arrested, or accused, or just anyone who was ever booked into their custody. And while I was writing this, I thought, ‘that also includes people who’ve already been victimized by this department.’ People who have been beaten by the police. People who have been wrongfully accused by the police. This is your biological data, my biological data, everyone’s biological data, and it is being sold to a private company without your consent, all so that they can expand their surveillance network.” 
Jansen asserted that the millions of images could include protesters, teachers, even state Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), who was wrongfully arrested by MPD during a curfew. “His arrest record is likely in there,” said Jansen. He also raised the 2025 case of officer Juwon Madlock, who used his access to police databases to pass intelligence about confidential informants and the home addresses of  targets to gangs searching out rivals. “If this is already happening, imagine what will happen when their abilities get expanded,” said Jansen.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Congress is trying to push the so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” into law through a legislative shortcut known as reconciliation. At its root, reconciliation means restoring harmony, mending what’s broken, and finding common ground. 
In our personal lives, it’s a path toward healing. But in Congress, that word has been twisted.
It is now being used to force through legislation that would strip health care and food access from millions of Americans, including thousands of Oklahomans, with little debate, no bipartisan support, and devastating consequences for families.
The budget reconciliation process, created in 1974, was designed to fine-tune fiscal policy. It was never meant to serve as a backdoor for major policy changes. It was intended to be used sparingly to balance budgets, not to upend lives. But today, it is being exploited. The current reconciliation bill is being rushed through without transparency, accountability or consensus. And if passed, it will cause real harm right here in Oklahoma.
An estimated 15 million people nationwide could lose their health coverage. As many as 172,000 of them live in Oklahoma — a state already struggling with access to care and ranked near the bottom in health outcomes.
The bill could slash Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits at a time where inflation and food insecurity in our rural communities are spiking. It could end enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, making insurance unaffordable for working families and seniors. It would also gut Medicaid, a program nearly 1 in 4 Oklahomans depend on.
This is not fiscal responsibility. It is cruelty disguised as policy.
I’ve lived what many families are facing. I remember when my youngest daughter had the flu and needed antibiotics. Our Medicaid had just lapsed due to a paperwork issue. I was told it would take two weeks to reprocess. I sat in my car outside the pharmacy, torn between paying out of pocket for the prescription or keeping our electricity on.
I chose the medicine because, for my family, living without electricity is less harmful than living without medication. I’ll never forget the feeling of panic and helplessness from having to make that choice. But what happens in summertime extreme heat episodes when people need medicine and electricity to survive? There is no choice when living without either could mean death.
That’s the reality of poverty. It is not just numbers on a budget sheet. It is day-to-day survival. It means deciding between food and medication, between health and heat. 
These are not abstract policy outcomes. They are real decisions families are forced to make because lawmakers continue to choose politics over people.
The bitter irony is, Congress is using reconciliation to divide and dismantle instead of to heal. The very meaning of the word has been lost in the rush to pass harmful policies. There is nothing reconciliatory about cutting food and health care from families while handing tax breaks to the wealthy.
It’s important to reflect on why our Republican congressional representatives Stephanie Bice, Josh Brecheen, Tom Cole, Frank Lucas, and Kevin Hern chose to support a reconciliation bill that removes vital resources from the very communities they represent. 
As a lifelong Oklahoman, I am not just disappointed. I am disheartened. We elect our representatives to fight for us, not to turn a blind eye to our struggles. It is painful to see them back legislation that would cause real harm to the families and communities they swore to protect.
The bill is now in the Senate. Will senators James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin turn their backs on us or will they listen to the voices of their constituents, neighbors and church members who will feel the impact of this bill the most?
Oklahoma has a proud tradition built on the idea of community. We pride ourselves on the Oklahoma Standard, which is neighbors helping neighbors and showing up in times of need. After tornadoes and wildfires, we do not ask who deserves help. We simply give it. But no one, no matter how hardworking, can thrive when the basic supports are stripped away.
Cutting health care and food aid is not aligned with Oklahoma values. It is a betrayal of them.
Hopefully our Oklahoma delegation will choose to lead and show Washington what reconciliation should look like.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho can enforce a state law that bans children from receiving gender-affirming care.
For a few months in early 2024, a federal court injunction blocked Idaho from enforcing the state law for all children in Idaho. But in April 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the judicial block to only apply to the minors who sued over the law.
The lawsuit’s dismissal on June 18 ended judicial blocks, allowing Idaho to enforce the law, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office says.
“No one has the right to harm children,” Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a statement. “For two years, my office defended Idaho’s common-sense law that protects kids from experimental procedures with lifelong, irreversible consequences.” 
The lawsuit was dismissed because the suing transgender minors moved out of state, ACLU of Idaho announced.

The same day as Idaho’s lawsuit was dismissed, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar state law in Tennessee, ruling that children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class, the Tennessee Lookout reported. 
“Idaho has done what it set out to do – drive out transgender people who don’t want to tolerate the unnecessary hostility toward them,” ACLU of Idaho Advocacy Fellow Jenna Damron said in a statement. “I wish I could say this ruling is surprising, but I’m not surprised. Still, I want every trans kid out there to know: You are loved. You are worthy. And we will keep fighting for you, no matter what this court says.”
Idaho doctors brace for impact on impending gender-affirming medication ban

Idaho’s law, passed in 2023, bans puberty blockers, hormones and surgical interventions for Idaho youth seeking gender-affirming care. But the law doesn’t ban all gender-affirming care for children, such as mental health services, hair removal, speech therapy, and period suppression. Idaho doctors previously told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
If doctors violate Idaho’s law, they could face a felony criminal charge. Surgeries were already not happening on minors in Idaho, the Sun previously reported.
The Alliance Defending Freedom, an influential conservative Christian law firm, helped represent Idaho in the lawsuit. Labrador and the law firm in 2023 signed an agreement to allow the firm to represent Idaho, for free, in litigation. 
ACLU of Idaho says it is still working on other lawsuits to protect trans rights, including challenges to Idaho’s law banning trans students from participating in sports teams of their same gender and against Idaho’s ban on using public funds for gender-affirming care, including in prisons.

(Getty Images)The charter school movement in Indiana is growing with a new option designed for rural families called microschools – each tailored to the community it serves. 
This fall, Eastern Hancock Schools in partnership with the Indiana Microschool Collaborative, will open Nature’s Gift Microschool — a small school located in the woods of Nameless Creek Youth Camp, about 30 miles east of Indianapolis. 
Collaborative board member Scott Bess, who is president and CEO of the Indiana Charter Innovation Center, said urban areas in Indiana have almost every option available for schools – traditional schools, charter schools or private schools. But suburbs and rural regions face limited choices, often forcing families to drive long distances or homeschool children, which is not always an option for everyone. 
“You can set up microschools in areas where you don’t need a 100,000 square foot building and all of the infrastructure,” Bess said. “You don’t need 400 students in places where the population wouldn’t support that.”
Nature’s Gift Microschool, in development for 18 months, welcomes K-12 students on a first-come, first-served application process. The school will operate as a public charter school, meaning it receives state and federal funding like any other public school. However, its small size and administration model allows more funding to go directly into the classroom, Bess said.
Indiana lawmakers passed more than two dozen K-12 education laws and funding changes in the state’s next two-year budget. 
Despite a statewide teacher shortage, Bess said teachers have been eager to join microschools and shown strong interest. He said many are drawn to the increased flexibility and the opportunity to work more closely with students. 
  Eastern Hancock Superintendent George Philhower
According to Bess, microschool teachers are not asked to prepare lesson plans every day and sit down with a group of 25 or more kids. Each classroom is multi-age, making the teacher more of a coach or facilitator. 
Eastern Hancock Superintendent George Philhower helped launch the microschool after speaking with local parents who opted out of sending their children to district schools. 
“The Indiana Microschool Collaborative is designed to give families more flexibility while ensuring students are still connected to a supportive school community. It’s one way we’re working to make education more personal, relevant, and responsive to the needs of students and families. We believe models like this can help Indiana better serve those who may not thrive in a traditional setting.” Philhower said. 
Bess said the goal of the IMC is to make all of the microschools hyper-local, driven by community demand. 
“This isn’t something where we’re going to say, hey, we’re going to open a new school in this community, and like no one asked for it, this is going to be more community, parent, student driven asking us, hey, we’d love to have you here,” Bess said. 
He said that in the next 10 years, they are expecting hundreds of microschools to open across the state. They are still collaborating with districts to find ways for students to participate in clubs or athletic programs since microschools will not have their own. 
This is not the first of its kind in Indiana. The Purdue Polytechnic High School Lab School opened in the fall 2023 in Indianapolis with about 20 students, and is among the dozen microschools across the state. 
“There’s no ‘this is exactly what a microschool is,’” Bess said. “In the following years under Indiana Microschool Collaborative they will all be different because the community they are serving is different. The students they are serving are different and the parents certainly are different.”

Due to shifting demographics, many Wyoming school districts are facing cuts to Title I funds for things like tutoring, professional development and kindergarten prep. 
The post Declining federal funds, late notice extinguish Ms. Paula’s preschool ‘magic’ appeared first on WyoFile .","At the head of a classroom in Lander, Paula Vincelette held up a small plastic pig and asked a dozen preschoolers to help the pig build a house with bricks. The students-turned-builders intently mimed the construction of small imaginary homes on the carpet in front of them. 
As Vincelette continued with the story of the “Three Little Pigs,” she paused often with prompts and questions. On cue, her rapt pupils enthusiastically repeated the famous tagline: “Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!!” 
It may have looked like a simple storytime, but Vincelette incorporated elements meant to prepare these children for the kindergarten classroom next year. Like constructing a house brick by brick, they were honing their listening skills and building vocabulary; learning how to raise their hands and speak in turn. Later, when she paired them up to build their own little story sets using actual props, they worked on sharing, body awareness and communication. 
As the early childhood education liaison for Fremont County School District 1, Vincelette has done this kind of work for five years. Along with direct instruction, she has also worked with child care providers and parents in her overarching goal to build better early childhood education foundations for district children. 
Her position, however, is coming to an end. The school district discovered late this spring that its 2025-26 federal Title I funds — which supplement state and local funding for low-achieving children — would be cut by roughly $86,000. Administrators made what they described as an extremely difficult choice to terminate the position.
Although the end of the early childhood education job comes amid a torrid of federal cuts fueled by President Donald Trump’s DOGE efforts, this one is unrelated. Title I funds are calculated based on demographics, specifically the number of children living in poverty. The number of Fremont County children living in poverty declined from 227 in the last cycle to 182 in this one, according to the Wyoming Department of Education. 
A similar demographic shift is occurring across much of the state. But what can on its face be interpreted as a positive trend had the downstream effect of reducing funding in most of Wyoming’s school districts. Notice from the federal government of decreases was months late, leaving many administrators scrambling after budgets were set. And, in places like Fremont County, it means an end to what many parents and supporters call a life-changing educational opportunity.

“Our family definitely benefited from Paula’s programs,” said Lander mom Amelia Decker. Decker started attending Vincelette’s free programs for families when her older son was a baby, received individual help when he was in preschool and enrolled him in the kindergarten transition session last summer. 
“Her advice, the space she offered for myself and other parents, and the learning opportunities about how to interact with my children shaped me as a mother and opened up so many connections for our family,” Decker said. 
In an era when educational experts say the role of early childhood education is crucial, many in Fremont County hope the district will be able to reinstate Vincelette’s position in the future. 
Census numbers and federal funds
The number of Wyoming children ages 5-17 living in poverty dropped between the 2022 and 2023 U.S. Census, the basis for calculating ‘25-26 Title I allocations. The number fell by nearly 700 children, from 11,420 to 10,731, according to WDE calculations. The state’s total population of children ages 5-17, meanwhile, remained relatively stable, barely budging from 98,774 to 98,764. But statewide public school enrollment has been falling for at least five years, a trend educators attribute to factors like more parents deciding to homeschool their children. 
The poverty-related shift resulted in a statewide drop of a little over $1 million for the federal Title I funds compared to the ‘24-25 school year, state figures indicate. 
Though it’s hard to say what specific mix of factors contributed to the trend in Wyoming, tax credits and stimulus payments in conjunction with relief programs were credited with the largest nationwide one-year drop in childhood poverty in 2021. 
Funding impacts for the incoming school year vary between districts. A decrease of 160 students in Natrona County District 1, for example, created a funding drop of roughly $63,000, and in Albany County School District 1, a decrease of 37 children living in poverty resulted in a loss of roughly $6,000. 
But in Teton County School District 1, the number of children in poverty increased from 134 to 153, which resulted in a funding bump of $307,000. The majority, however, will receive less Title I money. 
Fremont County School District’s Title I Coordinator Deidre Meyer’s job every year is “to look at our funding and see where this money is going to best serve our students under Title I,” she said.  


Under the federal regulations, Meyer noted, “the majority of the Title I funding for preschool is supposed to be spent on Head Start and [Community Development Services].”
Up until late May, she was operating under the assumption that the funding level was stable. But late that month, she received an email from the Wyoming Department of Education with the updated federal allocations. Those updates normally arrive by February. That’s when Meyer realized she would have significantly less to work with, she said. 
She attempted to move funds around, she said, but it wasn’t enough. Ultimately, she cut the early childhood liaison position because it was the option that affected the smallest number of students while still fulfilling the Title I grant requirements, she said. 
“It was very hard,” Meyer said. “It was a tough one.”
The timing only made it harder, FCSD1 Superintendent Mike Harris said. By the time the May 21 notification arrived, “our staffing decisions are pretty much done.” 
The tardiness, he said, “put a lot of districts in a tough spot. For those that are getting reduced funding now, they’re looking at their proposals and their projections, and they’re having to revise a lot.” 
It is unclear why the projections were so late this year, but the federal Department of Education has been in flux since the Trump administration laid off an estimated 1,400 employees this spring. That issue is tied up in litigation. 
A passion for early education 
It’s never a pleasant experience to learn you will no longer have a job, Vincelette said. Despite that, she had no ill words about the district and said she understood the difficult choice. 
Vincelette grew up in Rock Springs and pursued elementary education at the University of Wyoming. There, she studied under renowned UW professor Nikki Baldwin. 
“The way she taught was making you really think outside the box and push the quote-unquote standard of what we think early childhood should be,” Vincelette said. “I really connected with that.”
She also found inspiration in the deliberate and thoughtful curriculum at Laramie’s Early Care and Education Center, where her own two kids attended. 
Vincelette moved to Lander nine years ago to work as a preschool teacher for the school district. She transitioned to the early childhood education liaison five years ago, initially as part-time.

The position aimed to support the early childhood education landscape in a broader sense. To do that, Vincelette worked with local preschools and kindergarten classrooms to model and teach weekly lessons based on needs. She offered a free, weekly “Little Explorers” program for families with children under 5 to encourage learning and play. She advocated developmentally appropriate learning, worked with the family consumer science class at the high school and led the summer “Lights On” program for children about to enter kindergarten.
Vincelette is an adherent of evidence-based models, and a big part of her approach is learning through play. 
If educators present lessons “in a playful manner, students are going to remember that,” she said. Connecting it to joy and fun makes it more effective for small children, she said. 
She learns a lot from young children, she added, who have a purity, rawness and presence of mind she finds refreshing. 
It appears she has taken a page from that presence of mind in this situation. Instead of panicking about finding a new job, Vincelette said in the Lander classroom during a break in the summer pre-kindergarten program, she spent the final weeks of her job absorbed in the work.
‘Kid magic’
Back in the classroom, Vincelette’s way with kids was evident. Whether asking them to touch their ears while listening, telling the story with a toy wolf or asking them to place hands on top of their heads to show they were finished, she commanded their complete attention.  
Following story time, the children moved through play stations around the room — painting, handling fragile water beads, building with magnetic blocks, practicing handwriting with a magnetic “pen” among them. The stations were designed to help build things like motor skills, body awareness or language foundations, Vincelette said.

“Miss Paula has ‘kid magic,’” a local kindergarten teacher wrote in a testimonial after news broke that the position had been terminated. Vincelette collected a number of these in an effort to provide proof of how impactful the work has been. She hopes funding will be available in the future to support the reinstatement of something similar. 
Supporters hope so too. In the pages of testimonials, kindergarten teachers, preschool directors, parents and mentees praised her singular talent with small children during an era when evidence of the importance of early childhood education on long-term outcomes of success is mounting.
They credited Vincelette with quelling behavioral issues and igniting imagination, equipping parents with tools to encourage learning-based play at home, transforming teachers’ approach to instruction and easing transition into the classroom for all kids, including those who didn’t attend daycare or preschool.  
“Her absence will be profoundly felt by students, teachers, and families alike,” another teacher wrote. 
Decker, the Lander mom, recently watched her son finish kindergarten. While he has his ups and downs, she said, “he is thriving academically and as a person. I credit so much of that to Ms. Paula.”

Legislators mull increasing Medicaid payments, enhancing provider recruitment programs and other potential remedies.
The post Births fall in Wyoming hospitals as lawmakers study maternity care gaps appeared first on WyoFile .","Births continue to fall in many Wyoming hospitals as lawmakers seek remedies for widening gaps in maternity care across the state. 
Hospitals in Casper, Cheyenne, Rock Springs, Cody, Douglas and Lander are seeing declining deliveries, data from the Legislative Service Office shows. Four other hospitals — in Riverton, Kemmerer, Rawlins and most recently Evanston — have shut down birthing facilities entirely in recent years. When Evanston announced its closure at the end of 2024, it cited declining demand. 
Wyoming’s maternity gap issue appears to be most acute in Central Wyoming, according to Curtis Biggs, Gov. Mark Gordon’s senior policy advisor, where SageWest Hospital in Lander is the main birthing facility serving a huge area of Fremont and Sublette counties. 
“We are seeing a concerning trend of a decline in those births in that particular hospital, with a lot of births shifting to Thermopolis,” Biggs told the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health & Social Services Committee Monday. The latter hospital was the only one presented that has experienced a significant spike in deliveries.

A dearth of maternal health care has made pregnancy and childbirth increasingly tricky in widening swaths of Wyoming, a 2023 WyoFile investigation found. This is evident in Fremont County, where moms are opting to temporarily relocate to places like Denver and even the East Coast to deliver babies. It is evident in Rawlins, where families have to travel Interstate 80, a notorious stretch of highway that closes frequently in the winter months, to deliver in Laramie. And it is evident in Teton County, where overflow patients from elsewhere in the state are straining providers. 
Lawmakers made maternity care a top issue of study for the 2024 legislative off-season and began to identify a complicated mix of challenges for providing such care in rural places. 
Maternity care is back on the table this summer as policymakers work to improve doctor recruitment, regulations and a complex system of health care reimbursements. Despite some steps forward in the past year, as Biggs explained to lawmakers, the options for families seeking robust maternal health care remain scant or nonexistent in many parts of the state. 
The problem 
A Wyoming Health Department assessment found that nearly half of the state’s counties lacked a practicing OB-GYN in 2024. The State Scorecard on Women’s Health and Reproductive Care ranked Wyoming 42nd that same year. The state placed behind all of its neighbors.
Solutions have been elusive. Complicating the issue are provider challenges like low birth volume in rural areas, high costs of medical malpractice insurance, financial viability struggles for hospitals, abortion ban impacts on doctors, liability concerns and barriers for midwives to deliver in hospitals.  
Health care advocates have called on the state to expand Medicaid, promote midwifery and build partnerships that could boost care.

Along with the 2024 legislative committee study, the OB Subcommittee of Gov. Gordon’s Health Task Force also worked to explore solutions. That group narrowed its focus last summer to three areas: how to better utilize midwives, doulas and family physicians alongside obstetricians in delivery care; the possibility of creating OB medical fellowships to bolster care in Wyoming; and regionalizing the state’s maternity care.
The Joint Labor Committee took up the issue once more as an interim topic in 2025. During its two-day meeting this week in Casper, Deputy Director of the Wyoming Department of Health Franz Fuchs and Gordon’s policy advisor Biggs laid out the situation anew. 
“The primary problem we’re really diagnosing this with is hospital viability,” Fuchs said. “We believe that labor and delivery closures are really a symptom of broader financial stress on the hospitals, whether it’s due to low volume generally or management issues.”
That financial stress can come from a host of issues, he said, including low volume of births, management issues, nurse labor shortage and provider recruitment challenges, fewer women of childbearing age creating declining demand and comparatively low Medicaid payment rates. When stressed, hospitals look to offload services, he continued, and labor and delivery is an attractive candidate because it’s not profitable.  
Fuchs offered several options for aiding hospitals, including increasing Medicaid hospital payment rates for deliveries, increasing Medicaid payments to delivering providers, increasing funding for provider recruitment programs and increasing provider education opportunities or incentives for medical students. 
Other ideas that came up during the meeting were malpractice tort reform, mobile units that can travel to underserved areas and more oversight of the services local hospitals provide. 
Steps and directions 
Some steps have been taken to address the issue. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming is launching a program in July to support maternal health and respond to growing concerns about access to care. The Maternity Care Program will include a subscription service for prenatal vitamins and remote monitoring for high-risk pregnancies or those living in areas with little or no maternity care, among other services. 
Another step is a new OB residency track through the University of Wyoming Family Medicine Residency Program at Cheyenne. 
“We have residents selected that will be on an OB track starting in July when they start their second year, which means our real goal is for them either then to be able to get into an OB fellowship following residency, or  simply to go get a job, hopefully some place in the state,” said Dr. Jacques Beveridge, a Cheyenne OB-GYN. 
He also echoed a common sentiment when he urged lawmakers’ “favorable consideration of increasing Medicaid payment.”
As vice president of the Wyoming Hospital Association, Josh Hannes served on the governor’s health task force OB subcommittee.
If the committee is not OK with the current state of maternity care, Hannes said, “and where we believe it’s going to go if there’s no intervention, and you believe that the state has a role to play in doing better, then I think there’s a number of valuable recommendations that have been presented that could take bill form. We would be supportive of those.”
Ultimately, committee members voiced support for pursuing bills that would: help give midwives more authority to deliver; raise Medicaid reimbursements for obstetrics; offer protections for pregnancy resource centers; look into mobile health units; and study other states’ models for helping to pay for malpractice insurance.  
In addition, Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, said she would like the health department to consider removing the COVID-19 vaccine from the list of recommended vaccines for pregnant women.

The Big Beautiful Bill will have some ugly consequences for health care costs in the Equality State, writes Nate Martin. 
The post Congress is about to hike up Wyoming’s health insurance costs appeared first on WyoFile .","The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is supposed to be all about tax breaks. 

Opinion

But the bill actually cancels a tax break that could skyrocket health insurance costs for tens of thousands of people in Wyoming and drive up prices for all of us.
Wyoming’s Rep. Harriet Hageman and Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis love to talk about all the tax breaks that the Big Beautiful Bill is supposed to create. 
But they’re awfully quiet about getting rid of this one. 
As it’s written, the “Big Beautiful Bill” eliminates major tax credits that people in Wyoming use to buy private health insurance off the federal Healthcare Marketplace, via healthcare.gov.
By eliminating these tax credits, the bill would double, triple, or even quadruple the cost of insurance premiums many people in Wyoming pay. 
The result will be even tighter family budgets, more people without insurance, more medical debt, bankrupted hospitals, sicker communities, and a sicker workforce.
Currently, a single person earning $62,000 a year in Wyoming can buy a year’s worth of medical insurance for $5,270 thanks to Marketplace tax credits. If the Big Beautiful Bill eliminates those credits, that price will increase to $11,810, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
That’s more than double the cost. And that’s not the worst of it.
Older people in Wyoming who aren’t quite eligible for Medicare will see the biggest increases. 
Right now, a 60-year-old couple earning $80,000 a year together can buy health insurance from the Marketplace for $6,970 to cover both of them. 
Again, this is thanks to tax credits.
Under the Big Beautiful Bill, the cost will shoot up to $44,392 a year just for insurance premiums.
For most people nearing retirement, this cost will simply be impossible to pay.
Just shy of 40,000 people in Wyoming get their health insurance through the Marketplace, KFF Health News reported. 
These are mostly people who are self-employed or who work for small businesses that don’t offer job-based coverage, or they’re people who string together two or three part-time gigs. 
If you’ve never bought health insurance off the Marketplace — I did for years — what happens is that you select a plan from a private company, like Blue Cross Blue Shield, but you pay a lower price than you normally would as an individual customer. 
Your Marketplace tax credit covers the difference.
Americans have been eligible to buy health insurance with Marketplace tax credits since 2014. During the pandemic, Congress created “enhanced” tax credits that made insurance affordable for even more people.
These enhanced credits have been wildly popular in Wyoming. The number of people who got coverage with Marketplace tax credits in Wyoming increased by more than 75% since 2020, according to KFF Health News.
These “enhanced” credits are what the “Big Beautiful Bill” seeks to eliminate. 
This will mean a total loss of health coverage for 11,000 people in Wyoming. 
But that’s not all. The way it’s set up, Marketplace tax credits are basically subsidy payments to private insurance companies. 
When private companies lose a source of revenue, what do they do? 
They raise prices for the remaining customers.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming is the state’s largest insurer — covering more than 100,000 people — and the largest local vendor for coverage on the Healthcare Marketplace. They stand to lose significant business thanks to the “Big Beautiful Bill” and will react by driving up premium prices for the rest of us.
On top of the thousands of people who totally lose coverage as a result of canceling the Marketplace tax credits, roughly one in five people in the state will face a premium increase on their job-based or other private insurance.
Tax breaks are great for the people who need them. 
Right now, families in Wyoming need a break to help shoulder the cost of healthcare in our state, which is the second-highest in the nation.
Unfortunately, our elected leaders in Congress are too busy cheerleading tax cuts in the Big Beautiful Bill that will mostly benefit the richest people and corporations in America, all while driving up our national debt and increasing your health care premiums.
That doesn’t seem like much of a break to me.

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers sent more than 100 bills to the governor’s desk on the final day of session on Wednesday, though less than half of the bills that had been vying for funding. 
Among the bills legislators passed in the final hours are measures to provide exclusive rights to internet gaming for Wabanaki Nations, require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns and add Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to Maine’s learning results. 
Two bills aimed at helping with housing affordability, one by altering the real estate transfer tax to protect mobile home parks and another to establish a property tax relief task force, are also now on the governor’s desk. Another bill passed by lawmakers on Wednesday would establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following a spill in Brunswick last summer. 
And others would alter state government, including a change to make the governor’s energy office a cabinet level department and another to make it so a simple majority, rather than current two-thirds, of each chamber could extend the Legislature’s work beyond the statutory adjournment date.
These bills are not guaranteed to become law quite yet. The Maine Legislature adjourned sine die, or finally, and does not plan to reconvene until the start of the second regular session in January 2026. But Gov. Janet Mills now has 10 days to either sign or veto the bills passed on Wednesday. With the Legislature now adjourned, any bills Mills doesn’t sign will be “pocket vetoed.” 
So far this session, Mills has vetoed five bills, all of which lawmakers sustained on Wednesday.
All non-emergency laws passed this session will take effect on Sept. 24 unless the bill text notes otherwise. 
The 117 bills lawmakers passed on Wednesday followed the recommendations of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, which voted those proposals off of what’s known as the appropriations table on Tuesday.
These amount to about 40% of the total number of bills — nearly 300 — placed on the table throughout the session. Legislation on the table has largely already passed both chambers on initial votes but still needed to be funded.
While some of these bills could now become law, the appropriations committee reduced or struck altogether the allocations of most given limited resources. (More details here.)
One of the proposals it amended that now awaits approval from Mills is a measure to provide more funding for reproductive health care. 
The budget addition the governor signed into law last week provided $3 million for family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions. 
The bill now on the governor’s desk, LD 143, had initially called for $6 million toward these services, but the appropriations committee advanced an amended version on Tuesday that would instead provide up to another $3 million from the available unappropriated surplus by the end of the current fiscal year. 
It was clear Republicans opposed the measure in committee, with Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) saying she was “thoroughly disgusted.” But both chambers ultimately enacted it as amended on Wednesday, with the Democratic majority and Republican Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford backing it. 
But other proposals were approved as is. That was the case for one of the most debated bills in the appropriations committee on Tuesday: LD 1937, which sought to require hospitals and their affiliates to provide financial assistance programs for medical care.
Republicans on the committee criticized it as a measure that will increase hospitals’ costs while they’re already struggling, while Democrats countered that the bill would make sure people who don’t have insurance still have access to health care. 
The state delayed Medicaid payments to hospitals this spring after Senate Republicans refused to back a change package to address the urgent deficit without structural reform to the program. Now, hospitals are also bracing to possibly take on more costs for the uninsured due to proposed cuts to Medicaid in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”
But the committee left on the table the majority of the bills that had been placed there this year.  
Among those bills were two that sought to ensure the already required teachings of Wabanaki and African American studies are effectively implemented across all Maine schools. 
LD 1474 sought to permanently establish a Wabanaki studies specialist in the Maine Department of Education, while LD 1202 sought to create an African American Studies Advisory Council.
Two other bills that the committee did not move off the table would have expanded the state’s infrastructure to track and test sexual assault forensic examination kits, commonly called rape kits. These preserve evidence left behind during an assault through a forensic medical examination that survivors can choose to undergo immediately after a sexual assault. DNA evidence from these kits can then be used to solve and prevent crimes.
LD 549 would have established a statewide tracking system for such kits, and LD 1816 would have conducted an inventory of existing kits in the possession of law enforcement. 
Defying the appropriations committee decision, Bennett, the sponsor of LD 549, attempted to suspend the rules to take both his bill and LD 1816 off the table on Wednesday. His motions failed. “It’s unfortunate that the appropriations of the committee hasn’t responded to the urgent needs of some people of the state of Maine,” Bennett said. 
Sen. Brad Farrin (R-Somerset) also attempted to do the same for LD 182, which would provide per diem payments for MaineCare residents of the Maine Veterans’ Homes. His motion also failed. 
Appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said Tuesday night that the committee intends to carry over bills still on the table into next year, though they were not listed among the nearly 200 bills approved for carry over in a joint order passed on Wednesday. 
Each of the legislative policy committees requested that some of the bills in their possession be carried over to next year. In addition to these, the joint order included some bills that had remained tabled in the chambers upon adjournment. 
One of those measures was LD 1822, the proposal for a comprehensive data privacy law passed by the majority of the Judiciary Committee. Meanwhile, both chambers voted down a competing data privacy measure, LD 1088. (Read more about these proposals here).

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Legislative Council on Wednesday approved the nearly two-dozen topics that lawmakers will examine in interim study committees through the end of October.
A whopping 400 topics were suggested by lawmakers and agencies but were narrowed down to 22 “through a bipartisan process” involving legislative leadership, according to Legislative Services Agency Executive Director George Angelone. The resolution was approved in a voice vote.
Selected subjects range from the value of public lands to a look at medical debt. The panels tasked with studying them can play key roles in teeing up legislation for the next session — but don’t always.
“It just allows people to gather and have more, both formal and informal, conversations about sometimes complex topics,” House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, told reporters.
House and Senate heads will assign members to each committee in the coming weeks. The two chambers trade off who chairs the groups, and it’s the Senate’s turn this year.
What made the cut
Leaders from both parties enthused over one panel tasked with studying the value of Indiana’s recreational public lands, like state parks. It must consider the direct and indirect impacts of that land on local economies, including tourism, employment, health and more.
“It’s more than just a space for families to go for camping, for recreation. It’s also a huge economic boom for our state,” said Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington.

Her counterpart, Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, said quantifying the land’s value won’t lead to selling it off: “That’s not what I have in my mind.”
“We all know how valuable they are and how important they are, but the study committee will kind of flesh that out a little bit,” said Bray, R-Martinsville.
Another panel will consider medical debt: protecting debtors’ homes from liens or sales, collections or property lien limits, salary garnishment limits, monthly payment caps, and more.
Huston wrote one of the letters proposing that it be among the topics studied.
“We just have heard from a lot of different folks of what a financial burden that becomes to people, and how hard is to overcome it, and there’s very little pathway to resolve (it),” he said. “… We’ll take a look at it and see what options are available to us.”
Huston emphasized low-income Hoosiers or those who’ve needed particularly expensive procedures.
Yoder was also supportive, telling reporters, “Too many families are one medical crisis away from losing a home, losing their well-being, and we need to study that.”
Lawmakers will also review the “efficiency and effectiveness” of various state-created bodies with a focus on the work they’ve produced and how they’re funded.
It echoes an effort begun last year — although only one of the nine examined at the time had any current members show up to defend them.

“I couldn’t even begin to tell you the number of boards, commissions and study committees out there, and some of them might not be as productive as you might want them to be,” Bray said.
The panel might consider consolidating some, or getting rid of others that “haven’t been doing substantive work” recently, he added. “… It’s probably an exercise that should happen more often, is to take a look and see what’s really a productive effort and what’s not.”
Other topics include a review of child fatalities, water safety education, public school administrator salaries, long-term care insurance costs, postpartum checkups and artificial intelligence in state government, among others.
Several statutory committees and task forces — like for health care costs and Medicaid oversight — weren’t assigned any topics.
“We had a lot of legislation in those areas (over) this last session, and sometimes you’ve got to let some of those issues bake a little while, to see, before you have a new issue that you really have to grapple with,” Bray explained.
Other action
Separately, the council authorized Angelone to short five national organizations on Indiana’s membership dues.
They are the Council of State Governments, Education Commission of the States, National Conference of Insurance Legislators, National Conference of State Legislatures and National Council of Legislators from Gaming States.
“The general concept is that we would pay 5% less than the invoiced amount,” Angelone said, recalling the 5% budget cuts forced on state agencies following a grim revenue forecast.
The council took similar action in 2011, he continued, and paid the deficit amount in a later year. But the resolution approved Wednesday doesn’t have a built-in payback provision.
And, the 2011 move was negotiated to maintain Indiana’s membership, Bray said. Although this year’s “haircut” wasn’t, he expected the state to retain its place in those organizations.

(Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.











We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University



But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Jeff Landry vetoed budget language that would have provided insurance coverage for obesity medication like Wegovy to state employees. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)Gov. Jeff Landry struck language from the Louisiana budget plan that could have provided state employees and public school teachers with insurance coverage for popular weight-loss medication over the next year. 
The governor does not think the state would be able to cover the cost for the obesity drugs on a long-term basis. 

“These drugs can cost $1,000 a month per person,” Landry wrote in his letter to state lawmakers about the veto. “Even temporary coverage could set expectations for long-term use that Louisiana simply cannot afford.” 

The provision would have affected those enrolled in state health insurance plans with the Louisiana Office of Group Benefits. The office provides coverage to 223,000 people, including state employees, public school teachers, retirees and their dependents. 

It’s not clear how many would have been given access to the weight-loss medication before the governor’s veto. 
The struck-out language called for those health plans to “incorporate semaglutide medications for the purposes of weight loss” into their pharmacy benefits, but only if it didn’t cost the state self-insured plans more money. 
The coverage was also only guaranteed for the 2025-26 budget cycle, which runs from July 1 through June 30, 2026.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Semaglutide is sold under the brand names Ozempic, Rybelus and Wegovy and has become a popular weight-loss tool in recent years. It was originally developed to treat Type II diabetes and is supposed to be taken indefinitely. Patients are expected to regain weight they lost if they stop using the medication.

Prescription prices can lower when semaglutide is initially prescribed because of rebates drug manufacturers offer. But as Landry observed, the medication is very expensive, especially if those discounts are discontinued. 
Louisiana also has a higher-than-average obesity rate of 40%, compared with just 32.8% nationally, which means more people would likely qualify for the treatment. 
“If just a small portion of eligible employees begin using them, the long-term costs could quickly climb into the tens of millions,” the governor wrote in his veto message. 
North Carolina and West Virginia initially offered to cover weight-loss drugs for their state employees but ended up cutting the benefit when the price tags for doing so skyrocketed. Connecticut and Illinois have continued to offer weight-loss drug coverage to their state employees – but at a cost of at least $40 million and $210 million, respectively. 
Even if it can’t be used for weight loss, Landry said state health care plans will continue to offer semaglutide to Type II diabetes patients.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wegovy.jpg,,,2025-06-26 07:01:20.476403

Let’s be clear: This isn’t just political posturing. This bill, backed by fossil fuel interests and already passed in the House, would strip away the very tools Wisconsin families, businesses, farmers and communities are using to lower energy costs, create jobs and build a more resilient future. The damage to our state would be both immediate and long-term.
In Wisconsin alone, 82 clean energy projects are currently in the pipeline. These projects represent not just thousands of jobs and billions in investment — they’re the backbone of a 21st-century economy. From wind turbine manufacturing in Milwaukee’s Menomonee Valley to solar installations in rural communities, Wisconsinites are hard at work powering our future.
If the “Big, Broken Bill” becomes law, it threatens to cancel or delay many of these efforts. Clean energy tax credits would vanish. The Solar for All program and clean manufacturing investments would be eliminated. Tax incentives for electric vehicles, energy-efficient buildings, and sustainable agriculture would be repealed. These aren’t just policy tools — they’re direct investments in our people, places and potential. Many Wisconsin communities have used these credits to launch local projects that reduce taxpayer dollars through direct pay for solar, geothermal and clean vehicles.
And we can’t afford to go backward. Energy demand is skyrocketing — especially with the rapid expansion of AI and data centers. Experts warn electricity bills could jump by 70% in the next five years if we don’t act. Clean, renewable energy remains the cheapest and fastest option to deploy. Gutting these investments would lead to higher prices, more power interruptions and less energy reliability — leaving Wisconsin families and businesses to bear the cost.
Without these programs, household energy costs could rise by up to $400 a year. That’s a hidden tax hike on working families — piled on top of rising costs from tariffs and supply chain disruptions already straining our economy.
Even worse, the bill guts EPA pollution standards and allows major polluters to sidestep environmental compliance. It’s a taxpayer-funded giveaway to fossil fuel interests, trading our health, air and water for short-term corporate profits.
Let’s not forget Wisconsin’s farmers, who were just beginning to benefit from billions in IRA investments for conservation, renewable energy and carbon-smart agriculture. With grant contracts abruptly canceled, many family farms are left holding the bag, having made plans in good faith only to be blindsided.
We can do better. Wisconsin has the talent, tools and environmental leadership tradition to lead the clean energy economy. Clean energy already supports more than 71,000 jobs in our state. With the right investments, we could add 34,000 more and grow our economy by $21 billion by 2050.
We’re also home to over 350 clean energy supply chain companies. With support from IRA tax credits and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), we can expand local manufacturing of batteries, solar panels, wind components, EV systems and smart grid technology — positioning Wisconsin as a national clean energy hub.
This is the kind of forward-thinking, common-sense investment we need. It creates good jobs, lowers energy bills, strengthens supply chains and revitalizes communities.
The Senate still has time to act. Let’s urge our lawmakers, regardless of party, to reject this harmful bill and stand with the workers, innovators and families building a cleaner, stronger Wisconsin. Our policies should reflect our shared values of fairness, innovation, resilience and stewardship — not special treatment for polluters.
This isn’t about partisan politics. It’s about economic survival, energy independence and the future we want to leave our children.
It’s time to move forward, not backward, with a smarter stronger, and more sustainable Wisconsin.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)CHADRON — While recreational trail development in eastern Nebraska has hit a roadblock, progress is being made in the northwestern portion of the state to extend the nation’s longest rail-to-trail project, the Cowboy Trail.
The expansion comes as the 317-mile-long trail marks it’s 30th anniversary, when the national Rails to Trails Conservancy, which purchased the abandoned Chicago & North Western railroad line, donated it to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.
On a recent weekend, a group of bicycle enthusiasts set out from this northwest Nebraska college town to “monkey wrench” a single-track trail from Chadron eastward along a rarely used portion of remaining railroad track.
A simpler trail
The idea was to create a trail inexpensively and quickly by mowing a path in the right-of-way beside the track, rake out the rough spots, and then beat a trail into the hard soil by riding on it.


Celebrating the Cowboy Trail
Several events are planned this year to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Cowboy Trail, which extends 317-miles across northern Nebraska, crossing through 30 towns.
Events culminate Sept. 5 with a celebration in Valentine that includes a bike ride, a dinner and a social hour on the railroad bridge that spans the Niobrara River east of the community.
For information about all of the events, access the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission’s website.


“We call it monkey wrenching or a guerrilla trail,” said George Ledbetter, a retired newspaper reporter, avid biker and treasurer of the Northwest Nebraska Trails Association.
The work is among efforts by several trails groups in the region that, in recent years, have extended the Cowboy Trail another 17 miles from Gordon to Rushville and obtained grants to build needed bridges along the as-yet undeveloped segment west to Chadron.
That undeveloped segment, from Rushville to where the guerrilla trail ends 5 miles east of Chadron (where Game and Parks ownership ends), is expected to be constructed and completed in 2026.
“Then we will have 40 contiguous miles from Gordon to Chadron,” said Alex Duryea, the recreation trails manager for the state Game and Parks Commission.
Ledbetter said connecting the Cowboy Trail with downtown Chadron via the “guerrilla trail” will provide a needed link for cyclers eastward through the scenic Pine Ridge and on to Hay Springs, Rushville and Gordon. It also will fill a gap in an ambitious plan to develop a cross-continental trail, the Great American Rail-Trail, which would extend across Nebraska from Omaha to Harrison.
“The Cowboy Trail is one of the gems of the whole rail-trail network of the whole nation,” he said.
Northwest Nebraska bike riders have already seen what a developed bike trail can do for visitation. In the nearby Black Hills of South Dakota, the Mickelson Trail draws an estimated 70,000 riders a year. Expansion of the Cowboy Trail would enhance tourism in the Pine Ridge area of Nebraska, a pine-studded area that includes Chadron and Fort Robinson State Park and vast tracts of national forest land.
“Obviously, out here, our big draw is outdoor recreation — hiking, biking, hunting and horseback riding,” said Kerri Rempp, tourism director of Discover Northwest Nebraska. “Giving people safe places to ride only increases our ability to attract tourists.”
Completing the Chadron-to-Rushville portion still would leave a 91-mile gap in the Cowboy Trail from Gordon eastward to Valentine. Duryea said that while there’s interest in completing that segment of trail, a local group to coordinate that effort and seek local and grant support has not yet emerged.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Expansion of the Cowboy Trail in northwestern Nebraska comes as trail enthusiasts struggle to bridge a gap in trails between Lincoln and Omaha across Cass County. The Cass County Board recently declined to affirm a 10-mile pathway for a trail to bridge a gap there, declining to OK months of work selecting a preferred route. A county board subcommittee is now at work trying to find an acceptable alternative route.
Such roadblocks aren’t unusual for trail development, and the Cass County connector trail lacks an abandoned rail line to follow, forcing up the cost and the need to find right of way that’s acceptable for nearby landowners.
“It takes time and it takes support from local trail users to develop new trails,” Rempp said. “These things are not cheap. They take a lot of time, and they take a lot of work.”
Support matters
Local “buy in,” Duryea said, is essential as well.


Less of a burr in Cowboy Trail’s saddle
“Goats heads” or puncture vine has been a plague upon the Cowboy Trail in sections since it was opened.
The spiny seeds produced by the invasive plant can puncture tires, causing delays and headaches during bike rides.
But Alex Duryea, trail boss for the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, said a dent in the goats head population has been accomplished via some spraying, and, for the past two years, use of a mechanical removal device called a “sticker burr roller.”
A foam roller catches the burrs, which are collected by the slow-moving device, he said.
Duryea said that you still might get a flat tire from a goats head on the Cowboy Trail, but the removal device has reduced complaints.

The Northwest Nebraska Trails Association was founded in 2017 after being inspired by the success of trail advocates in Gordon and Rushville via the Cowboy Trails West group.
Besides its Cowboy Trail work and advocacy with state and national groups, the organization has produced maps of mountain bike and hiking trails in the Pine Ridge, Toadstool Park and around Chadron State College, and it has helped with a Volksmarch held in May at Fort Robinson.
Trail advocates, Ledbetter said, had thought the Rushville-to-Chadron portion might be completed sooner, but a grant to build that segment fell short of the project’s cost and provided only enough funds for a required environmental study and to build bridges along that portion. Then, he said, flooding that damaged the eastern portion of the Cowboy Trail in the Norfolk area delayed work on the western portion.
More recently, financial help and support from the Chadron Rotary Club, the Discover Northwest Nebraska group, the national Rails-to-Trails Conservancy and the City of Chadron have led to the planned development of the five-mile segment from downtown Chadron to where the Game and Parks part of the trail begins.
The railroad that still owns that five-mile section of track and leases it to park idle railcars, agreed to allow the trails group to utilize right of way along the track. Some informational kiosks have been installed already, and a local Eagle Scout built a bench for trailside rests.
The City of Chadron soon will take bids to build a one-mile segment from the downtown area, Ledbetter said, and the Northwest Nebraska Trails group has signed an agreement with the city to maintain and develop the remaining four miles.
Rather than wait for funding to lay down a crushed livestock trail on the remaining segment, he said local cyclists decided to mow a path and lay down a single-track trail by holding rides every Saturday morning. Volunteers have removed trees, branches and even barbed wire from the path and have used rakes and hoes to smooth the path where necessary, Ledbetter said.
The trails group is talking with local health officials about establishing trails and safe paths within Chadron and about establishing trails to connect with Chadron State Park and about extending the Cowboy Trail westward to Crawford and points west.
“Our goals are pretty huge really and we hope we can keep it going,” he said.

(Courtesy of the Bureau of Land Management)Newspapers, TV and social media have been blowing up lately, shining a light on a provision tucked in the U.S. Senate’s version of the “Big Beautiful Bill” that would force the sale of public lands. The last couple of days have been dizzying. The sell off language has been removed, only to be added back, then changed multiple times. In, out, in. Enough already. 
Utah’s Mike Lee to make new attempt to sell off public lands in US Senate mega-bill

Selling off our public lands is wildly out of step with the values of people across our state. These are the lands where we hunt, fish, camp, hike, ride ATVs and horses, watch wildlife and find solitude. They’re our heritage — and our birthright. And that birthright is under threat.
Republicans and Democrats, ranchers and river runners, hunters and hikers — we may not agree on everything, but we all agree that public lands should stay in public hands. 
Let’s be clear about what selling public lands means: Idahoans will lose access to land that has always belonged to them. “No trespassing” signs will go up. Gates will be locked. 
This is not hypothetical. This is not alarmism. This is a real threat. And Idahoans have stepped up to confront this threat. Thousands of Idahoans have spoken out. Together we’ve called, written and visited the offices of our senators to voice our deep opposition to these land sale provisions. And it made a difference. Both U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch have now issued statements opposing the sale of public lands.

As this fight rages, those who want to steal your land have tried to dodge criticism and throw you off by repeatedly offering up different versions of language. But no “kinder, gentler” version of selling off public lands changes that selling off our public lands is still selling off public lands. It is a betrayal of all Idahoans and all Americans. It is a terrible idea and sets a terrible precedent for future sell offs of our heritage.
You see, Sen. Crapo is not just any senator. He’s the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the very committee responsible for writing this bill. In plain terms: this is Sen. Crapo’s bill. If the language forcing the sale of public lands gets removed, it will be because he made it happen. If it stays in, it’s because he allowed it to stay.
Sen.  Crapo, Idahoans are counting on you. You have the power — and the means — to stop the sale and privatization of the lands Idahoans and Americans enjoy for hunting, fishing, camping, snowmobiling, and more. Heed the calls of Idahoans and remove this terrible provision from the bill. You’ve told Idahoans you oppose selling off our public lands. Now is the time to turn that statement into action.
Sen. Risch, we need your leadership here too. As a senior member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and as someone who has championed public access in the past, your voice matters. We need you to make it crystal clear that selling public land is unacceptable and must be stripped from this bill.
Let’s not forget what’s at stake. These lands support our economy. They sustain our rural communities. They protect our water, our wildlife and our way of life.  They’re also a legacy. It’s our duty to protect them for those who will come after us. If we allow them to be sold now, they will be lost forever. And future generations will look back and wonder why we didn’t fight harder.
Idahoans believe in collaboration, in common ground, and in the power of citizens to influence policy. That’s exactly what’s happening right now. Idahoans are speaking up. They’re standing up. And they’re watching closely.
So to Sen. Crapo and Sen. Risch, we say this: thank you for listening to your constituents. Thank you for opposing this terrible idea. Now, let’s finish the job.
Strip the public land sale provision from the reconciliation bill. Keep public lands in public hands. And show the nation that when it comes to defending our shared heritage, Idaho leads.
Because once these lands are gone, they’re gone. Let’s not let that happen — not on our watch.

(Getty Images)The “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” that is making its way through Congress contains big cuts for disability services in West Virginia — a state with the nation’s highest rate of people with disabilities. 
One in three West Virginia residents live with a disability, according to federal data. The state’s system supporting thousands of people with disabilities is already over stretched due to health care deserts and a shortage of community group homes.
Republicans in Washington’s megabill calls for the elimination of all University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, including the one housed at West Virginia University, through funding cuts to the Administration for Community Living.
  Lesley Cottrell
“The impact will be immediate,” said Lesley Cottrell, director of the WVU Center for Excellence in Disabilities, which provides free services to 340,000 West Virginians living with a disability and their families through a network of programs and six clinics.
The center oversees the state’s only feeding and swallowing clinic. Cottrell said that without federal funding, the clinic won’t be able to serve patients, including children, who struggle to eat. 
The programs around the state have also helped children with communication disorders interact with the world by using augmentative and alternative communication devices, supported individuals with traumatic brain injuries and helped people with disabilities find jobs.
The budget bill lumps the nationwide developmental disability programs into diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which leading Republicans don’t want to fund amid a GOP-crack down on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.
Cottrell said categorizing the CED program as DEI is an unfair description. 
“Without placing any judgment on DEI programs or initiatives … We are not, by definition, a DEI program in the sense that anyone — family or individual with those disabilities — can get our services for free. We don’t separate it by age, gender, ethnicity, race,” she explained. “Some of the foundations of DEI initiatives just aren’t present.”
The university provides a $500,000 match in funding, and the WVU CED promotes research aimed at tackling disability-related issues relevant to West Virginia.
The center employs more than 100 people through its office and contract positions. Many of those jobs would be eliminated if federal funding is eliminated through the bill, Cottrell said. 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., declined to comment on the bill since negotiations continue. President Donald Trump said he wants the massive spending bill on his desk by July 4, but several major disputes — including pending cuts to Medicaid funding that would impact West Virginia — have yet to be resolved in the Senate. 
Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., and West Virginia’s Republican Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore did not return requests for comments for this story.
Several other disability-focused groups could see funding cuts because of the bill, including Disability Rights West Virginia. 
“The proposed federal budget cuts to the protection and advocacy systems like Disability Rights of West Virginia will be disastrous for the state, persons with disabilities and public safety,” said Mike Folio, DRWV’s legal director. 
The budget bill contains spending reductions for the federal departments of health and education, which would impact DRWV, according to Folio.
“DRWV received less than $2 [million] in federal funds in 2024 and stretched those dollars to monitor 176 separate facilities in West Virginia and conduct nearly 400 monitoring visits to protect our grandparents, mothers and fathers, children and family members,” he added.
DRWV serves as the state’s federally mandated protection and advocacy system for people with disabilities in West Virginia. The organization has alerted lawmakers and media to issues in state-run hospitals for people with disabilities, including patients being unnecessarily held at William R. Sharpe Jr. Hospital in Weston without appropriate therapy and support services. 
The organization also discovered that a nonverbal, elderly man died in 2024 from burn injuries after being left too long in a whirlpool of scalding water at a state-run long-term care facility.
According to Folio, DRWV fills the regulatory gaps that state run offices can’t cover. 
Cottrell said the funding cuts won’t just impact people with disabilities but could also weaken funding that supports respite care for families and programs that help parents whose children are awaiting a potential autism diagnosis. 
“That’ll all be gone,” she said.

(Spencer Platt | Getty Images)Medicaid ensures 80 million Americans, and over 500,000 West Virginians, have access to health care. Importantly, Medicaid is also a core source of oral health care coverage for families across the country, which is critical to ensuring overall health and well-being.
Everything Medicaid is under attack and many of the greatest health achievements in the last 15 years  are about to be rolled back.  
Medicaid is a critical lifeline to dental care for people with disabilities, kids and families with low incomes. Children enrolled in Medicaid have guaranteed, comprehensive dental benefits and Medicaid dental benefits are a significant driver of access to dental care for low-income working-age adults and seniors. Medicaid dental coverage also improves oral health outcomes for adults and children alike.
Additionally, Medicaid dental benefits are a driver of economic health for individuals and states. Adults with Medicaid dental coverage spend less out-of-pocket on dental care, helping them avoid medical debt and freeing up resources to meet their basic needs and engage in their local economy. For many adults, being able to afford dental care could be the key to getting a new job or advancing in their current one. When adults have Medicaid dental coverage, their job prospects and job performance improve. And adults with good oral health have more job opportunities. The improved oral health associated with Medicaid dental benefits could save states at least $273 million per year. Medicaid cuts will harm oral health.
According to Gina Sharps, West Virginia Oral Health Coalition executive director, numerous studies show that Medicaid adult dental coverage lowers overall health care spending on chronic disease management and emergency department usage. Emergency department visits alone cost an estimated $2.1 billion per year, and research indicates that nearly 79% of these visits could be addressed in a dental office — a potential savings of up to $1.7 billion per year. It also boosts oral health outcomes for patients and increases employment opportunities.
The high cost of dental care, particularly out-of-pocket costs, remains a major barrier to care. And for many families, Medicaid is one of the only affordable options to obtain oral health services. It is no wonder that it is also extremely popular, with over 74% of voters supporting better oral health access in Medicaid. However, adult dental services in Medicaid are considered “optional” for states and therefore at particular risk for being cut or scaled back if states lose Medicaid funding.
Current congressional proposals to cut or cap Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for billionaires would threaten the health and livelihood of tens of thousands of West Virginians. These cuts would lead to devastating dental coverage losses and ballooning medical debt, of which dental bills are already a key driver. In general, Medicaid cuts would push good oral health out of reach, causing avoidable dental problems to become emergencies and costing the health care system millions of dollars in unnecessary spending.
Reductions in federal Medicaid funding could lead states to roll back Medicaid expansion or cut program eligibility taking away health care from millions of seniors, kids and low- income adults. Additionally, the 23 million adults who rely on Medicaid for dental care would suddenly be left with nothing. In addition to reducing access to care and worsening oral health outcomes, dental coverage loses also decrease work productivity. Many adults who lose Medicaid coverage would go completely uninsured; some may be able to switch to private coverage through their state’s marketplace or their employer, but there are no requirements for private medical insurance to cover oral health.  
Additionally, major changes or cuts to the program could also put access to kids’ oral health coverage at risk even though it is mandatory. Cuts to Medicaid oral health benefits would lead to immediate and lasting harm. 
When families lose Medicaid coverage, they are more likely to go without oral health coverage than obtain expensive, private insurance. As a result, individuals forgo preventive care and early interventions, ultimately ending up in the emergency department for care at higher cost for the patient, hospital systems, states, and taxpayers.
Good oral health not only enables you to functionally perform as a human being — like speaking, smiling and eating — it is also important for communication, human relationships and financial prosperity. Poor dental health carries serious consequences that can lead to systemic and costly health conditions, such as oral health cancer and even heart disease. 
This is especially the case for those who have the biggest obstacle in getting access to dental care — rural and lower income households. 
Oral health is health and any cuts to Medicaid will have drastic consequences for both.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Tyler Lizenby)A decade ago, Kaila Adia Story and Missy Jackson were determined: Whether or not the United States government ever recognized them as a couple, they would marry. 
The two, who live in Louisville, had dated for three years by the time the United States Supreme Court took up Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark case that ultimately led to nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage on June 26, 2015. 
But before the nation’s highest court ruled 5-4 in favor of marriage equality, couples like the Story-Jacksons didn’t know where their futures stood. 
“We knew that the Supreme Court at the time was talking about same sex marriage,” Kaila said. “I just really did not have a lot of faith in the court, just from growing up in a homophobic society.” 
In May 2015, Kaila attended a conference in Florence, Italy, and Missy — the “woman out of my dreams” — went with her and proposed. 
Missy proposed before knowing they could legally marry, she said, because all that mattered was Kaila and her. She is used to “living on my own terms,” she said, and the next step was a commitment ceremony with Kaila. 
“I hit all the boxes of all the protected classes: Black, female, being a lesbian,” said Missy, 52. “Every day, we’re fighting to just exist. So I’m used to that. You either gotta be quiet, or you take up space. And then the way my mama raised me is: I belong in every room I go to.” 
For Missy, legal marriage is a “piece of paper,” and “the real commitment is to each other.” Their marriage was going to be “valid, regardless” of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Missy said.

“By the time SCOTUS announces that same sex marriage is legal, I knew that I wanted to (have a) wedding, and I knew that we were going to have a wedding and get married,” Kaila said. “Because it wasn’t legal, I thought that it was going to be just something smaller and much more intimate, but it became huge.” 
The day same-sex marriage was legalized, Kaila cried. She had never imagined that in her lifetime, she would be able to marry the woman she loved, legally, in Kentucky. 
“I couldn’t believe how things had lined up, how I didn’t feel like I was going to fall in any kind of deep love when I moved here (from Michigan), and then to be surprised and joyous by that, and then to go even farther, and to get engaged in this really romantic place, and then to come back a month later and realize that we’ll actually be able to get married and it will be legal,” she remembered. “I was blown away.” 
Kaila and Missy married April 9, 2016. 
“It was a wonderful time to finally have a legal acknowledgement that our unions are true, deep, loving — and just like everyone else’s,” Kaila said. 
‘A wonderful time,’ followed by ‘firestorm’

The Obergefell decision was immediately followed by a “firestorm” and “spotlight” on Kentucky, said Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky.
“When there is a victory, or when we do take a step forward in our civil rights and civil liberties, there’s often backlash to that,” Duke told the Lantern. “And the backlash here in Kentucky was almost immediate in terms of county clerk defiance.” 
Duke was referring to former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, who made national headlines for denying same-sex marriage licenses in 2015 over her religious beliefs. Davis was briefly jailed that year.  
A decade after the Obergefell decision, political and religious conservatives still debate and challenge the landmark ruling. 
Davis has kept her legal case alive since then. The Christian law firm representing Davis, Liberty Counsel, is now moving to use her case as a way to overturn Obergefell using the same legal logic that undid Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed the constitutional right to abortion. 
And, at a national meeting in early June of thousands Southern Baptists, the nation’s top protestant denomination voted in favor of pushing for an overthrow of Obergefell. 
When the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas said at the time that the court should overturn Obergefell. 
Meanwhile, in 2024, the American Civil Liberties Union said it was tracking 588 bills it considers “anti LGBTQ.” 
The 2015 decision was never going to end all opposition to the LGBTQ community, Duke said, but “it felt significant. I definitely could not have envisioned in 2015 that we would be where we are today, 10 years later.” 
Kentucky doesn’t have a statewide fairness ordinance, which is “civil rights legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity and to dismantle systemic racism,” according to the Fairness Campaign. At least 24 Kentucky communities have their own fairness ordinances, though. 
Conversion therapy still has a green light in the state. The discredited practice attempts to alter gender expression and sexual attraction that diverges from heterosexual normativity “with the specific aim to promote heterosexuality as a preferable outcome,” according to the The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 
Work on both of these issues, and more, “still continues,” Duke said. “Certainly within the past couple of years, the transgender community has been singled out and targeted specifically. Those attacks have been very intense.” 
Duke referenced the 2023 law passed in the Kentucky statehouse that banned certain medical care for transgender minors, such as hormone treatments. 
“I do think that there are many ways that, especially within the Kentucky General Assembly, that LGBTQ folks, particularly trans folks, have unfortunately become a political pawn,” Duke said. 
She takes issue, she said, with “culture war issues” being “prioritized as if they’re the most pressing issue in the commonwealth.” 
A ‘disheartening, disconcerting and devastating” time

The ongoing pushback against their community doesn’t affect the Story-Jacksons’ day-to-day lives, though it’s an upsetting time. 
“Both of us feel grateful to be with one another, to be married. We still celebrate and are excited about who we are,” Kaila said. “We’re in community with really, really great and supportive people who support our marriage, but … it’s really disheartening, disconcerting and then devastating right now, in certain ways, when it comes to watching the news, to seeing not only the attacks on same sex marriage, but the attacks specifically on trans communities, the attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion in work spaces.” 
In 2024, the Kentucky General Assembly banned DEI offices and programs in public colleges and universities in line with a national trend of pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion. 
In his second term, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders gutting DEI programs and activities across the federal government. The Trump administration also recently withdrew grant money promised to the University of Louisville’s Eating Anxiety Treatment (EAT) Lab, citing DEI issues in the withdrawal letter.

“This fixation on wanting to return to a time in which people were brutalized, dehumanized, not seen and felt as if they needed to be hidden — I’m not sure why anyone wants to return to that kind of political and social moment,” Kaila said. “It wasn’t good then. That’s why we left that moment.” 
Missy, who works in a steel mill, is surrounded by people who are her opposites, she said, including some who’ve never met a gay person before.
Living open, she said, shows people that “we’re not that much different.” 
“We’re the same; we’re no different. I have a dog, you have a dog,” Missy said. “I belong, and I’m supposed to love who I love, and I’m happy. We have a happy life. We have a healthy life.” 
‘We’ve always fought back.’ 
Kaila is an author, an associate professor of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies, with a joint appointment in the Department of Pan-African Studies, at the University of Louisville, and the Audre Lorde chair in Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. In these roles, she finds herself guiding young people through a tough political moment. 
Her students, she said, “are completely intolerant of the hate that they’re seeing directed at their friends and loved ones and people in their community.” 
It’s making them “almost completely apathetic to the electoral process” and “completely despondent around politics in general.” 
“I think all LGBTQ people know that in each decade, in each political moment, we have never, ever been safe as a community,” she said. “What we also recognize is that in each instance where we have always had such visceral and severe attacks on our communities — and this moment is probably the most severe — we have shown up for each other and for ourselves in each instance, fighting back and demanding for our communities to be treated in a different way.” 
The message she works to leave her students with, she said, is “we’ve always fought back” and rejected “gender and sexual tyranny.” 
“Even though this period, this moment, has been dehumanizing, disheartening and really, really depressing …. recognize that we have always responded, socially, politically, culturally,” Kaila said. “This time period should be no different.” 
Still, fighting against homophobia is “exhausting,” she said. 
“I saw this meme the other day that said, ‘if you’re tired of hearing about homophobia, imagine living through it.’ I’m tired of hearing about it; I’m tired of dealing with it,” she said. “I’m 45 years old. I’ve been gay in all these different cities and all these different places, and it’s so tiring and exhausting to keep having to defend your right to live as you are.” 
‘Black, gay and free’

It’s unclear if the challenges to Obergefell have enough legal validity to be successful, Duke said, but pointed out that the Supreme Court has proven it’s “willing to roll back rights that people have enjoyed.” 
Kaila Story-Jackson, meanwhile, said she has even less faith in the high court in 2025 than she did in 2015. 
“I don’t have much faith in SCOTUS maintaining the Obergefell decision, just like they did not maintain the Roe v Wade decision,” she said. “It’s interesting, because my faith in the court in 2015 wasn’t top tier, but right now, in 2025, it’s way below. I will be thrilled and blown away if they are able to uphold this. I think it’s absurd that folks have only been allowed to be legally married and recognized for 10 years, and there’s already this kind of backlash and pushback in response to it.” 
For now, she and Missy focus on what brings them joy: their dog, Denver, and traveling together — including a potential return to Italy next year. 
“At dinner time, we’ll talk about what’s happened today, because every day is some event, but we don’t get completely mired down. Our life is still full of community and fun and joy,” Kaila said. “I still, every day, wake up feeling Black, gay and free.”

(Courtesy of Pennsylvania Environmental Council)Anyone who doubts the economic importance of outdoor recreation in Pennsylvania should visit rural Huntingdon County, home of Raystown Lake. Thousands visit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-operated recreation area each year to boat, fish, and camp, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars spent at local businesses. 
Or rather, they used to. 
On a typical Memorial Day weekend, Raystown Lake would be packed. 
But this year, in the wake of federal staffing cuts and the resulting closure of a major campground, normally thriving operations near the lake are struggling to stay afloat. One proprietor told the Philadelphia Inquirer the campground closure has cut their business in half. Another described the scene to WJAC-TV as a “ghost town.”

Compare Raystown to any of Pennsylvania’s 124 state parks, where business is booming. Earlier this year, the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) reported a nearly 30 percent increase in state park campground reservations, and with vacation season now fully underway, tourist dollars are pouring into communities with open public lands. 
Already a $19 billion industry, Pennsylvania’s outdoor sector is only getting bigger as financially-pinched vacationers across the northeastern U.S. increasingly seek out adventures closer to home, and people are turning to the outdoors for peace and relaxation.
DCNR is working hard to maintain its spectacular resources, while also meeting growing demand, but new opportunities also await. Last month, state lawmakers got a peek at one of those opportunities on a tour of what could soon be the commonwealth’s first underground state park: the sprawling four-mile cave complex known as Laurel Caverns. 
The Cale family has stewarded the privately owned site in Fayette County for almost a century, welcoming visitors since 1964. This year, owner David Cale is ready to realize his lifelong dream of making the caverns a free, public amenity.
Acquiring Laurel Caverns won’t cost taxpayers a dime, since the Cales intend to donate the 400-acre property. All that’s required is a modest investment to update and staff the facility, which — judging from the nearly $2 billion visitor dollars spent annually in the Laurel Highlands — will soon deliver big returns in economic activity and community benefits. 
That investment is part of Governor Shapiro’s 2025-2026 budget proposal, which includes funding for trails and public lands statewide. 
Among them is the popular Glen Onoko Falls hiking trail near Jim Thorpe, which would reopen as a state park site after being closed to hikers since 2019. Like Laurel Caverns, Glen Onoko is already an established attraction with a proven record of drawing visitors who spend money locally, not to mention a spot beloved by generations of Lehigh Valley residents.

Just as important as opening new parks, the Shapiro budget also increases funding for DCNR to manage and improve our existing public lands across the state. These funds support everything from trash removal and picnic shelters to resort-class amenities enjoyed by locals and visitors alike, such as the golf course and swimming pool at Caledonia State Park.
As lawmakers hash out the budget in the coming weeks, they would do well to consider Raystown Lake, and what happens when we fail to support the outdoor assets that give back so much to our communities and the businesses that sustain them. 
The good news is that leaders in both parties understand why investing in public lands and outdoor recreation is an easy win for the economy, the environment, and all Pennsylvanians. Present and future generations of Pennsylvanians will thank Gov. Shapiro and state legislators for making our communities more livable and prosperous.

Kelly O. Hayes, the acting U.S. Attorney for Maryland, is acting no more.
Hayes was sworn in Tuesday as the next U.S. attorney for the state, replacing former U.S. Attorney Erek Barron, who left in February.
Hayes was chosen for interim post by Attorney General Pam Bondi, but someone nominated by the attorney general can only hold the post in a interim capacity for 120 days. After that, falls to the judges of the district to appoint a successor.
After the clock ran out of Hayes’ interim appointment, with no replacement nominee coming from the White House, the judges of the district voted to appoint Hayes to the job. She took the oath of office Tuesday, administered by Chief Judge George L. Russell III, and will serve until a replacement is nominated and approved.
Hayes said in a prepared statement that she was “honored by the confidence” the judges placed in her to serve.
“It is a privilege to lead this great office and to work alongside such dedicated public servants committed to upholding the rule of law and seeking justice on behalf of our communities,” her statement said. “I look forward to continuing to zealously combat criminal activity to ensure public safety and to steadfastly represent the interests of the United States.”
Hayed was raised in Montgomery County, attended the University of Maryland, College Park, and received her law degree from the University of North Carolina School of Law. After clerking for Judge Janis L. Sammartino in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, she joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland in 2013.
She served as principal deputy chief, deputy chief and, since 2021, as chief of the district court’s Southern Division. As chief, she oversaw all criminal investigations and prosecutions for the district. She also served as deputy appellate chief for the district.
Hayes has made “public safety, national security, and the protection of children …  top priorities for the District,” according to the news release.

Shingledecker comes home to Chesapeake Conservancy
In its search for new leadership, the Chesapeake Conservancy turned to an old friend, announcing Wednesday that one of its former vice presidents would be taking the helm. Susan Shingledecker, who served as the conservancy’s vice president and director of programs from 2017 to 2020, will step in as CEO on Sept. 8, according to a news release from the conservancy.

The Conservancy, which is based in Annapolis, focuses on land conservation and water restoration in Maryland.
Shingledecker will replace Joel Dunn, who left the nonprofit in December after 14 years. He went to the Campaign for Nature.
“Susan’s return is a homecoming we are thrilled to celebrate,” said Chesapeake Conservancy Board Chair Stephanie Meeks in a statement. “Following a nationwide search, the Board is confident that Susan brings the strategic leadership, nonprofit management experience and deep passion for the Chesapeake Bay that this role requires.
Shingledecker, who lives in Severna Park with her husband and two sons, comes from Earth Science Information Partners, where she served as executive director. ESIP, a Severna Park nonprofit funded by cooperative agreements with NASA, NOAA, and USGS, works to encourage scientific collaboration in the earth and climate science field.
“I’m honored to return to Chesapeake Conservancy and lead this incredible team working to protect the nation’s largest estuary and one of the most iconic and vital landscapes in the country,” Shingledecker said in the statement. “My five years at ESIP have given me an incredible understanding of the opportunities for data to inform our conservation work, increase our efficiency and grow our impact.”
Is it that time already?
The 2026 primary election is a year off — June 23, 2026 — which means it’s time for candidates to start lining up. It’s probably well before time, actually, but judging by the emails landing in our inbox in recent days, it’s never too early for some candidates. In State House races:
– Three of the four Republican incumbents in District 5, which includes parts of Carroll and Frederick counties, are running as a team for reelection. Sen. Justin Ready and Dels. April Rose and Chris Tomlinson are touting their “strong, conservative record”. Ready, the Senate minority whip, serves on Senate Finance Committee. Rose, in her second term, is the assistant minority leader and serves on the Economic Matters Committee, while Tomlinson, a freshman, is chair of the Carroll County delegation and a member of the Judiciary Committee.

Rose and Tomlinson face challenges in the GOP primary from Steve Whisler, a member of the Carroll County Board of Education who filed way back in March, and Sallie Taylor, a party activist who served as a staff member for former Rep. Roscoe Bartlett and Del. Dan Cox. She filed in April.
The fourth incumbent in District 5, Republican Del. Christopher Bouchat, told the Baltimore Sun last fall that he was disgusted with Annapolis and would not seek reelection. But not too disgusted, apparently — he told The Sun last week that he’s running for governor, although he has yet to file. He hasn’t told Maryland Matters anything because he has not returned several days worth of calls.
– Nobody claims to be running for governor in southeastern Baltimore’s District 46, so the four Democrats there getting the gang back together and running as a team. Sen. Bill Ferguson and Dels. Luke Clippinger, Mark Edelson and Robbyn Lewis tout their success bringing millions to district projects, investing in schools, pushing for affordable housing and fighting “the chaos and lawlessness of the Trump administration,” among other achievements. Ferguson, first elected in 2010, has been president of the Senate since 2020. Clippinger, also elected in 2010, is chair of the Judiciary Committee. Lewis, appointed in 2016, serves on Environment and Transportation and Edelson, a freshman, is on the Appropriations Committee. They are the only four filed in the district so far.
– In Montgomery County’s District 18, Democratic Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher did not announce a reelection team. But there were plenty of other names on his reelection announcement, which listed more than 60 endorsements already from federal, state and local lawmakers, beginning with Gov. Wes Moore (D) down to community leaders. Waldstreicher, who was elected in 2018, has been vice chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee since 2020, where he has led on various criminal justice reform measures, including the Gun Safety Act of 2023. “I’m humbled that these diverse community leaders and elected officials are supporting my re-election campaign,” Waldstreicher said in his announcement.
His District 18 mate, Del. Aaron Kaufman (D), filed paperwork for reelection last month, the only candidate actually filed in the district so far. Kaufman, elected in 2022, serves on the House Judiciary Committee. The freshman delegate, who has cerebral palsy, highlights his advocacy on disability rights such as legislation signed into law this year on powered wheelchairs.

The Republican-led state Senate passed both measures earlier this year. They now head to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. The votes occurred just hours after the Senate approved a House measure dealing with the same topic.
Senate Bill 227 targets K-12 education, while Senate Bill 558 focuses on public colleges and universities. The bills would prohibit what sponsors describe as “divisive concepts” from being taught in the classroom.
These measures are part of Republican-led efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the public sector — in government, higher education and K-12 education.
Several Democratic representatives denounced the legislation targeting K-12 schools and universities as harmful in Wednesday’s House floor debate. “It is un-American to be anti-diversity, equity and inclusion,” said Rep. Amos L. Quick III, D-Guilford.
Opponents also contend the bills will chill academic freedom and honest discussions about historical oppression and that the prohibitions are vaguely worded. “What this bill does is chill teachers. They will be reluctant… to teach about the Trail of Tears, or Japanese internment camps… some of these things that are crucial to North Carolina history,” said Rep. Marcia Morey, D-Durham.
Separately, the North Carolina Senate on Wednesday passed House Bill 171, (“Equality in State Agencies/Prohibition on DEI”) which would ban state agencies from promoting, supporting, funding, implementing or maintaining workplace DEI, including in hirings, dedicated staff positions and offering or requiring DEI training. 
State workers who violate the measure could be subject to removal, a fine of up to $5,000 and potential civil litigation. And the state auditor’s office, currently held by Republican Dave Boliek, would conduct “periodic” audits of agencies to assure compliance.
Sen. Danny Britt, R-Hoke, described the bill as ensuring “everyone should be treated equally across the board.” An amendment adopted on the Senate floor added provisions that would require internal grievance processes before civil actions can be filed.
Another amendment would require that only a prevailing party could receive attorney fees. The bill had originally seemed to indicate that complainants who challenged alleged DEI activities unsuccessfully could receive them. Britt stated he believes this change “would eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the number of unfounded DEI claims.”
Sen. Val Applewhite of Cumberland County said the bill is not about protecting merit. “It’s about protecting privilege. It’s about fear, fear that as this nation grows more diverse… the grip on power by a shrinking few is slipping away.”
The bill will now go back to the House for concurrence with the Senate amendments.
To overcome a potential veto from Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, House Republicans would need at least one Democrat to vote with them if all members are present. In the Senate, Republicans have enough votes along party lines to override a veto on their own. No action from Stein expected until after lawmakers depart from Raleigh for a summer break.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AdobeStock_Race-Diversity-CRT-Featured.jpg,,,2025-06-26 06:00:46.347146

Restrictions on assault weapons got top billing, including on the eight-and-a-half hour marathon that marked the final day of the session, but there was plenty more to crow about and criticize during the jam-packed final weeks.
Here are five wins you might have missed from the 2025 Rhode Island General Assembly. Stay tuned for the losses, coming Friday.

 1. Shekarchi zones in on housing 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi succeeded in his push to boost housing production in Rhode Island for a third consecutive year, with 10 of the 12 bills of his legislative package clearing the Senate in the final days of the session. (All 12 had already secured approval in the lower chamber.)
That includes two bills sponsored by Shekarchi: one to expand electronic permitting and another to amend the state’s building code by centralizing the responsibilities of various officials, commissions, and boards involved in building and fire code permitting.
Other bills passed include measures to allow townhouses wherever duplexes are permitted, require mixed-use zoning in every community, and promote the conversion of vacant or underused commercial buildings into housing.
“Rhode Island’s housing crisis was decades in the making and is taking a sustained effort, over the course of years, to address,” Shekarchi said in a statement Monday.  “I am so appreciative of all of the partners who work with me to address our housing shortage, and this progress is the result of our collaborative efforts.”
Legislation that would have allowed development of vacant state-owned land did not make it across the finish line. Shekarchi described the bill as in need of some “fine-tuning,” pledging to work with the Senate on it again next year.  
Also left hanging by the Senate was legislation that would have eased local restrictions on subdividing large parcels of land, despite having passed in the House on May 15. However, Shekarchi noted that elements of the stalled bill were addressed in one of the successful 10 bills, which sought to eliminate unnecessary red tape and delays in local land subdivision more broadly.
Senate President Valarie Lawson said while there were concerns with the bill, she intends to continue to work with Shekarchi and other lawmakers to encourage further housing development.

2. All rise for AG Neronha 
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s skilled litigation style persuaded lawmakers to his side on a host of policy changes and added funding for his office for new hires.
Neronha initially sought 13 more staffers for his office, asking for $1.7 million to fund the hires in his fiscal 2026 budget request to Gov. Dan McKee. McKee’s proposed spending plan did not offer any of the money, or additional employees.
Neronha subsequently revised his request, asking lawmakers in the House Committee on Finance for four, rather than 13, hires, funded by settlements his office had won for the states. Lawmakers included an $848,000 allocation of state settlement money for the extra AG staffers in the final fiscal 2026 budget.
Neronha thanked lawmakers for funding the hires in a statement Tuesday.
“The people of my Office show up to work every day with one goal: improve the lives of Rhode Islanders,” Neronha said. “These four additional attorneys will share in that goal, and deliver for the residents of our state.”
Neronha scored wins on several policy changes, too, including a change to state procurement to ban “bid-rigging” by public officials. The Neronha-backed legislation taking aim at McKee’s involvement in “steering” a state education contract to the ILO Group in 2021, passed unanimously in the Senate on the final night of the session, having already secured approval by a strong majority of the House. 
Lawmakers also signed on to versions of some of Neronha’s proposed remedies for the health care crisis, such as using Medicare reimbursement rates as the standard by which to hike corresponding Medicaid payments to primary care providers, and doing away with cumbersome and time-consuming pre-authorization requirements for primary care providers.
Finally, the AG’s office staved off an eleventh hour challenge by House Republicans to his authority over state settlements. GOP lawmakers unsuccessfully attempted during the House budget vote on June 17 to siphon $11 million from the AG’s fiscal 2026 funding as a quid pro quo for what they argued was an unconstitutional overstep of his authority. Neronha had already set in motion a plan to spend the $11 million state settlement from the Route 6/10 contamination lawsuit on pediatric dental care in Providence. 
Speaking to reporters after the June 17 House budget vote, Shekarchi affirmed Neronha’s authority over the state settlement funds.
“If this particular settlement was unfair, the solution is to appeal that,” Shekarchi said. “What we’re doing with the money is helping underprivileged children with health care and dental care is a good thing and I will never be against that.”
Neronha’s office did not return inquiries for comment Tuesday.

3. Republicans at the ready for 2026 
The most high-profile victory of the session belongs to those who supported a state ban on assault-style weapons — even if the final legislation did not go as far as some had hoped. 
But state Republicans wasted little time turning “L” on what they say is a matter of Constitutional rights into a potential win for the party and its candidates in the 2026 election cycle.
GOP Chairman Joe Powers initiated the call to action Friday night, declaring it was actively recruiting candidates to challenge the “anti-Constitution, anti-liberty legislators” who voted to limit assault-style weapons in the state.
“We now have a clear, targeted list of every legislator who voted to betray their oath — and their time is running out,” Powers said in a statement. “To every Rhode Islander who still believes in the Constitution — we’re not going to fix this by posting memes or yelling at the TV. We fix it by running for office, knocking doors, and taking back this state seat by seat.”
His call to action has already been met with a flurry of responses — a few dozen potential candidates have reached out to the Republican Party in just the last four days, Powers said Tuesday night.
Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz of North Smithfield debuted a new “Keeping the Spirit of 1776 Alive” fundraising campaign Tuesday morning, seeking support and donations to retain and boost the Republican’s 14-person presence on Smith Hill.
It’s no secret that state and local Republican party committees have struggled to recruit candidates for state and local office, diminishing their voice in a solidly blue state. Could the contested ban on assault weapons sales change the tides in their favor?
“I think it can’t hurt,” said Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican and former House minority leader.
Newberry had already heard rumblings of potential Republican challengers coming out of the woodwork to run against Sen. John Burke, a West Warwick Democrat who voted for the revised assault weapons ban in committee, and again on the floor, last week. Burke in a text Tuesday declined to comment, noting the 2026 legislative elections are still more than a year away.
Powers also declined to reveal details of party strategy, but said the GOP is eyeing specific legislative districts to mount challenges next year, with plans in the works well before the legislature’s final vote on the assault weapons sale ban.
“We saw the writing on the wall,” Powers said in an interview. “We’re not dummies.”

4. Hands off those cat claws  
Your furniture may hate you, but your cat will soon thank you. Lawmakers in the final days of session approved companion bills that ban declawing felines unless it’s for therapeutic use, such as to treat recurring infections or an abnormal condition in the claw that comprises the feline’s health. Anyone who violates the ban faces a fine up to $1,000. 
State law already prohibits landlords from requiring their tenants’ cats to be declawed, carrying a similar fine to the legislation banning the practice statewide.
“Declawing is painful, unnecessary and inhumane — it’s no way to treat any pet,” Sen. Melissa Murray, the Woonsocket Democrat who sponsored the bill, said in a statement. “Fortunately, there has been growing awareness of the risks and cruelty of declawing.”
Declawing a cat is viewed as similar to severing a human finger at the last knuckle, according to written testimony by the Animal League Defense Legislative Fund. The organization stated that scratching is a normal, healthy behavior for felines as it allows them to stretch their back muscles, relieve stress, and keep their nails in good condition.
The proposed ban also saw support from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Paw Project, and Humane World for Animals. 
But not all advocacy groups supported the legislation. The Rhode Island Veterinary Medical Association submitted a letter saying the decision to declaw should be left up to vets, not the state.
New York was the first state to ban declawing cats in 2019, followed by Maryland in 2022 and Virginia in March 2024. Massachusetts legalized a similar ban earlier in the year.

5. Self storage sale protections that could have been 
It might seem odd to celebrate failed legislation. But Rep. Cherie Cruz refused to let the outcome diminish her joy over a rare demonstration of bipartisan support for protections for self-storage unit renters in the lower chamber Friday.
The proposal aims to weaken public notice requirements that self-storage facility owners have to give before selling off contents of “abandoned units.”
Cruz successfully petitioned her legislative colleagues to support a floor amendment to the House version that gives storage unit renters 15 days, rather than one, to access their unit after defaulting on a payment, and extends the amount of time storage unit owners have to advertise pending sales online.
“This bill wasn’t my top priority, but it was something I saw as a basic right to notice,” Cruz said in an interview Tuesday. She noted that the housing crisis has forced people to move into smaller spaces, potentially doubling or tripling up with family or friends and putting their belongings in self storage. 
Cruz’ amendment scraped through in a 32-31 vote, with support from progressive and moderate Democrats and nine of 10 chamber Republicans. Adding to the drama of the narrowest vote margin of the night: Rep. Brandon Voas, a Cumberland Democrat, missed the vote on the amendment, but later asked to have his vote recorded as a ‘“no.”
His request was shot down because it would have changed the outcome — against the chamber’s rules. 
Cruz called it “democracy in action,” noting the rarity for floor amendments on any issue to pass without leadership’s backing.
“It gave me hope,” she said.
But her triumph was fleeting; minutes later, the chamber approved the unchanged, Senate version of the bill, which sets a one-day window for renters to access their units after defaulting on payments, and only requires online notice of a sale once a week for two consecutive weeks.
Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat and bill sponsor, did not vote for Cruz’ amendment, though Cruz said Hull told her he thought it “made sense.” Hull did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment.
Robert Jacquard, a lobbyist paid $3,500 a month to represent the Self Storage Association, said in an email Tuesday that he would work with Cruz on her ideas for additional notice requirements during the “offseason.”

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)This week Virginia has set new heat records and come close to beating old ones for this time of year. The Richmond airport recorded a temperature of 99 degrees at the hottest part of the day on Tuesday, Roanoke reached 99, and Alexandria reached 98. Those high temperatures come at a crucial time for many crops growing across the commonwealth.
“We are at a critical point for certain crops like corn that are either about to pollinate or our pollinating and so it will have an impact,” said Wilmer Stoneman, vice president of agriculture development and innovation for the Virginia Farm Bureau.
Virginia’s largest commodities include corn, soybeans, cotton, peanuts and wheat. In the summer, crops are pollinating but high heat reduces the pollen survival rate, which could impact yields down the road. 
“When it comes to corn there’s research that’s been done that says for every day you’re above 90 degrees consecutively you can have a 3-5% reduction in yield during bloom period,” said Matthew Chappell, director of Virginia Tech’s Tidewater Agricultural Research and Extension Center.
While some may have lamented the amount of rain Virginia experienced this spring, those soggy days and others to come are helping save crops as the temperature rises. The state’s soil is very moist which helps keep crops alive, even though rainy days may make it difficult for farmers to get tractors through their fields. The National Weather Service in Wakefield predicts showers will fall across most regions of the state this weekend and some days next week. 
“This is the time of year we need a little temperature but we have to have rain,” Stoneman said.
If things were to take a turn towards drier patterns while high temperatures persist, then farmers would have cause to worry. As of Wednesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that no counties in Virginia are under drought conditions. This year the state has seen an average of three inches more rain than normal.
“This time last year it turned hot, but it also turned dry. We had what a lot of people consider a mini drought and it basically went from a bumper corn crop the year before to basically no corn crop,” Stoneman said. “Producers had half over or didn’t produce any corn last year.”
Chappell said that this year is not necessarily hotter than past years; rather the extreme heat is happening earlier than usual during a delicate time in the growing process for multiple crops. The heat also puts restraints on when laborers can be in the fields tending to crops, as heat indexes can reach extremely dangerous levels.
“Extremes and prolonged weather extremes are always a tough hurdle for farmers to to deal with, but they’re resilient folks,” Stoneman said, adding that the rain is welcome and necessary. “We can’t have all sunshine and make a crop.”
Stoneman also said the wet soil is contributing to a humid weather pattern that can help form thunderstorms that will provide more rain. But that precipitation needs to be widespread across the growing fields to have a big impact on crops.

This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Tennessee Lookout . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published. 
ProPublica and the Tennessee Lookout are continuing to investigate Harpeth Financial, which owns Flex Loan operator Advance Financial and online sportsbook Action 247. To tell us about the experience you had with either or both companies, call or text reporter Adam Friedman at 615-249-8509.
Jeanette Thomas had just made her first payment on a loan from payday lender Advance Financial when she said the company emailed her with “good news.” She could borrow $206 more. 
The solicitation was a relief to Thomas, a 62-year-old grandmother who had already exhausted the $783 disability check she receives each month since her health conditions render her unable to work. 
Over the next few months, Thomas made the required minimum payments on what started in 2019 as a $400 loan to buy Christmas presents. But each time she did so, the company invited her to borrow almost all of the payment back, she said, with emails or letters like “Access Your Cash Today” or “You’re Already Approved.”
“They kept trying to rope me in,” Thomas said.
In the months that followed, the company continued to expand her credit, allowing Thomas to borrow close to $1,600 in total. In the emails and letters that Thomas kept, Advance never stated how much it would cost if she continued to reborrow. 
Thomas had read her original loan documents warning that the loan carried a high 279.5% interest rate and would be challenging to pay off. But as the loan balance grew, Thomas came to realize she was trapped. By the spring of 2021, Thomas had paid Advance almost $4,000, yet she still owed more than $1,000 and was paying more than $200 a month to cover the interest, depleting the disability checks that were her only source of income.
Until the Flex Loan, reborrowing or rolling over payday loans was against the law. Tennessee lawmakers first banned reborrowing when they passed the state’s payday lending law in 1997. They reaffirmed that protection in 2011 when they updated that law.
When Tennessee lawmakers passed a 2014 law allowing Flex Loans, they included no such provision.
Instead, the bill’s sponsor, current House Speaker Cameron Sexton, said the loans could be better for borrowers because it required them to make a monthly minimum payment that covered all fees, interest and 3% of the principal. This key provision would ensure that borrowers would always be paying down the principal on the loan.
Thomas and more than a dozen borrowers told the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica that Advance has encouraged them through emails and notifications to borrow back the value of almost all of the payments they made, tearing a hole in the safety net the law tried to put in place. 
All but one of the 14 borrowers who spoke to the newsrooms for this story reported having reborrowed at least once as part of their Advance loan. As with Thomas, Advance made them eligible to borrow more shortly after paying, even though they were often making the minimum payments and almost immediately borrowing the money back to cover the cost of the payment they just made.  Advance went on to sue 12 of these borrowers once they stopped being able to afford the loan.
  Advance Financial sent ads to several borrowers telling them they were eligible to borrow more. (Obtained by Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica. Highlighted and redacted by ProPublica.)
Andrea Heady, 45, was sued by Advance in Knoxville for over $7,300, despite having paid the company nearly double what she ultimately borrowed. She initially took out $750 through a Flex Loan after the hours at her university job were slashed in June 2020.
“I’ve always sent money home to my mom,” who was taking care of Heady’s sister, she said. “It was COVID. My aunt and uncle were very sick, then they passed away and I just needed money.”
Heady said Advance would send her notifications letting her know she could borrow more. One email appeared as a financial statement, but included in bold and large text was the amount she had available to borrow. The statement did not provide a payment schedule, a new loan amount, the total cost of the loan or how long it would take to pay off making minimum payments, information a lender would have been required to provide if she’d been borrowing on a credit card.

Heady reborrowed on her Flex Loan over a dozen times over the next 18 months as Advance increased her credit limit seven times. She stopped paying when her monthly payments of $650 equaled a quarter of her paycheck. 
Heady hoped the company would forget about her, but it didn’t. In 2024 Advance sued and won a wage garnishment against her. Ultimately, Heady will end up paying Advance over $14,000 on the $3,850 she borrowed. 
David Hill, a 36-year-old from Nashville, started by borrowing $175 from Advance in February 2020. Each month he would repay the full borrowed amount, including interest and fees, and reborrow the principal, often on the same or next day. Over 18 months, he reborrowed almost 80 times.
“COVID happened and I was going through financial trouble,” Hill said. “I would get a check and pay it off. But then I would have to borrow it back to have money.”
Via email, Advance kept increasing his credit limit and encouraging him to borrow more. “Dear David,” started two of the emails, which contained notes like “good news — you have $645 available.” Hill eventually reached a point where he couldn’t afford the minimum payment, totaling over $400 a month. 
He stopped paying and the company sued him in 2023 for over $4,700.

The Lookout and ProPublica sent detailed questions to Cullen Earnest, the senior vice president of public policy at Advance Financial. Earnest repeated what he said in a previous statement, that the company has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. He added that the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions has received just 91 complaints about flexible credit lenders since 2020, representing less than 0.001% of all new flex loan agreements, and that this data reflects the satisfaction of the vast majority of Advance’s customers.
The Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica previously reported that the company has sued over 110,000 Tennesseeans since it began offering the Flex Loan in 2015, making it one of the largest single plaintiffs in the state. One of the subjects in that story reborrowed on her Flex Loan over a dozen times, turning $4,400 in borrowed cash into more than $12,500 in payments to Advance. The company sued her and won a judgment that led to the garnishment of her wages. 
Christopher Peterson, a senior official with the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2012 to 2016 and a contributor to multiple reports about payday loans, said the agency sought to limit reborrowing on payday and title loans because the desire to borrow again often indicated that borrowers couldn’t afford the loans and would be paying them off forever. That is especially true of the Flex Loan in Tennessee, he said. 
“It’s a nasty loan,” he said.
 A better loan?
The CFPB began targeting high-interest lenders in 2013, releasing a report on the dangers of payday loans and how reborrowing often led to debt traps. 
With the threat of federal regulation looming, Advance Financial Chairman Michael Hodges started working with Tennessee lawmakers to create a new type of high-interest loan that would avoid federal oversight, he told the Nashville Business Journal. 
In Tennessee’s state House, Advance and other high-interest lenders turned to Sexton to sponsor the legislation.
Sexton was then the majority whip, a position typically reserved for ambitious state House members hoping to travel up the party’s ranks. Sexton also knew banking. He worked at a local bank as a business development executive, a position he still holds today, along with having a seat on its board.

Starting in the spring of 2014, Sexton began guiding Flex Loan legislation through Tennessee’s state House committees. On the surface, the bill appeared to be a new type of loan with a 24% interest rate, which would be significantly cheaper than the triple-digit interest on payday and title loans. But the actual cost could be found in the bill’s details, which gave lenders the right to charge a 0.7% daily customary fee, which over a year adds another 255.5%.
Official video recordings from legislative committee hearings show that neither legislators nor Sexton discussed reborrowing or the loan’s interest rate. 
When Sexton took to the Tennessee House floor in April 2014, his colleagues showed him deference because of his banking experience, said former Rep. Craig Fitzhugh, a rural West Tennessee Democrat and the minority leader at the time, who sponsored the original payday lending legislation in 1997.
During the hearing, Fitzhugh asked Sexton if he thought the soon-to-be-created Flex Loan was “a step up for consumers” compared to payday and title loans. Sexton said that was a “fair statement.”
When a lawmaker asked about the interest rate, Sexton said it was 190% to 210%, which is lower than the actual rate. But Sexton once again assured lawmakers that the minimum payment would reduce the cost of the loan for consumers. 
“When you reduce the principal each and every month, obviously you’re decreasing the amount of interest,” Sexton said from the House floor.
The Flex Loan legislation passed the Tennessee House 83-6, with Fitzhugh abstaining from the vote. Fitzhugh said the high-interest lending landscape in Tennessee has only “gotten worse” over the past decade because of Flex Loans. 
Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Knoxville Democrat, said she regrets voting for the Flex Loan legislation and feels like proponents of the legislation misled her.
“I definitely would not vote that way today, and would like to work to fix that massive mistake that’s hurt so many Tennesseans,” Johnson said. 
A spokesperson for Sexton did not respond to questions from Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica.  
Since passing the Flex Loans bill in 2014, Sexton has received over $105,000 in contributions to his campaign and political action committee from Advance Financial and its affiliated PACs, making them one of his largest contributors. 
No money for food
Over five years after the law passed, Jeanette Thomas walked into an Advance Financial store three weeks before Christmas 2019 and filled out an application.
Thomas said she listed her income, gave them her debit card number and permission to directly charge her bank account the required monthly minimum payment. A borrower isn’t required to put up any assets, like a car or future paycheck, to get a Flex Loan. 
  Thomas wound up in a debt trap, borrowing again and again to keep herself afloat. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had tried to restrict reborrowing to protect consumers from falling into this kind of hole. (Stacy Kranitz for ProPublica)
Unlike some other borrowers, Advance allowed Thomas to pay monthly, instead of biweekly, because that’s how she received her federal disability benefits. Thomas said she suffered physical abuse for decades that left her with a traumatic brain injury.
The company deposited $400 into her account the same day she walked into the store. 
At the time of the loan, Thomas had been trying to build a better relationship with her two sons and three grandchildren. She used the money to purchase gift cards, art supplies and toys. She was happy to be able to give her family something for the holidays. 
Thomas’ first minimum payment to Advance was due Dec. 31 and was a manageable $51.78. That December had been cold, and when Thomas’ heat bill came in $50 higher than normal, she started to worry. 
Then, just two days after her loan payment, Thomas said an unsolicited email arrived from Advance telling her she was eligible to borrow $206 more. Thomas thought she could afford it. Why would Advance loan her money she couldn’t pay back, she said she thought. 
What Thomas did not realize was her first bill had only been for a 13-day payment period, meaning she’d been charged less than two weeks of interest. By taking the additional loan for an entire month, her monthly payment would almost triple to $130 per month. 
Over the next two months, the company offered her a lifeline, extending her credit limit enough that she could make her payments with the money she’d just borrowed. 
Eventually, Advance stopped increasing her credit limit and her monthly payment had increased to $230 a month, almost a third of her disability check.
Thomas cut her spending to the bone, hoping that a few months of payments would get her out of debt. She turned to friends to help pay for food, and to a local church to cover her utility bill. 
Thomas said Advance sent her mailers and emails multiple times a month, offering to let her borrow any of the principal she had paid off. She tried to resist, but inevitably, she would have an unexpected expense, like medical bills from a series of mini strokes. 
Thomas found herself in the position the CFPB had warned about when it sought to restrict reborrowing. Former CFPB official Peterson, who’s now a law professor at the University of Utah, helped work on the agency’s 2017 payday regulations. At the time, the agency wrote that consumers who reborrowed would inevitably be forced to choose between making an unaffordable payment on the loan or paying for necessities like food or rent.
By May 2021, Thomas could no longer afford to pay. The company kept her loan open and unpaid for 90 days, allowing the interest and fees to accumulate, nearly doubling the amount due to $1,700. Advance then charged Thomas two times in one week, withdrawing $430, or half of her monthly budget.
  Thomas continues to receive bills requesting a minimum payment of $226.49 years after closing her account with Advance Financial. (Obtained by Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.)
“I can remember just lying in my bed, stomach hurting and doubled over in pain because I couldn’t get something to eat,” Thomas said. 
Not knowing where to turn for help, Thomas filed a complaint with the Tennessee attorney general’s Division of Consumer Affairs. In her complaint, she wrote that Advance “needs to stop abusing their power.” 
“Now I cannot pay my rent,” she said. 
The state investigated the case and took no action. By October 2022, Advance noted on one of Thomas’s monthly bills that it had “written off” her loan and closed her account. Unlike the other 110,000 Tennesseans who fell behind in their payments, Advance hasn’t sued Thomas, whose federal benefits are protected from garnishment. 
The company also agreed in a letter to the state to “cease all communications” with Thomas, but Advance continues to send bills requesting a minimum payment of $226.49.

“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
Living longer
People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.











The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares



“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.
Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
Uncertain grants
Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help toshore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
Skipping pills
In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

It’s not that often that floor debates in the North Carolina legislature shed much light on important subjects.
One impressive exception to this rule took place this week, however, when Durham Democratic Senator Sophia Chitlik addressed a bill that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in state government.
In her remarks, Chitlik pointed out a glaring problem that has afflicted numerous bills advanced by Republican lawmakers this year – bills that that they, the sponsors, claim are designed to end all discrimination and promote quote “equal opportunity.” Namely, they were all drafted and sponsored exclusively by white men.
As Chitlik’s remarks served to highlight, the Senate features several members from groups long targeted for blatant discrimination in our society – women, people off color, LGBTQ people – and it only stands to reason that any bill worth its salt on the subject would include at least some involvement from them. But of course, they don’t.
The bottom line: The anti-DEI bills aren’t about ending discrimination — they’re about protecting it. Arguments to the contrary are simply delusional.

The PCS (Proposed Committee Substitute) to House Bill 59 would expand eligibility requirements for existing county programs that give property tax breaks to citizens 65 and older and to those with permanent disabilities. The programs are administered by all of North Carolina’s 100 counties, but state lawmakers must sign off on any changes.
  Rep. Erin Paré (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Rising property taxes, particularly in the state’s urban centers, are making it increasingly difficult for seniors and citizens with disabilities to stay in their homes, State Rep. Erin Paré (R-Wake), a bill sponsor, told committee members.
“I’ve heard from people who are in their 80s who bought their homes 50 years ago and they just simply cannot, based on their fixed income as a senior citizen, afford to live there anymore because they can’t afford their property tax bill,” Paré said. “It’s very sad because at that age, they want to stay in their home, of course, and they don’t want to move, and this is a desperate situation for them.”
The committee gave a favorable report to the PCS and referred it to the House Finance Committee. Meanwhile, Senate Bill 349, a bill that Paré said does “almost the exact same thing” is winding its way through the Senate. With the General Assembly set depart Raleigh for an extended summer break this week, final approval — if it occurs — will almost certainly not occur until later in the summer or fall.
The current relief menu
North Carolina currently offers three property tax relief programs for qualified homeowners that are administered by counties:

The Elderly/Disabled Homestead Exemption is for residents 65 years or older or those who are totally and permanently disabled. The program excludes from taxes the greater of $25,000 or 50% of the assessed value of the owner’s permanent residence.
The Circuit Breaker limits the amount of annual property taxes the owner pays on their permanent residence. Eligibility is limited to homeowners who are 65 and older or who are totally and permanently disabled. The tax bill is limited to a fixed percentage of income, and any taxes owed above that limit is deferred until a “disqualifying event” such as the owner’s death. This program requires a new application to be filed every year.
The Disabled Veteran Exclusion program excludes up to the first $45,000 of the appraised value of the permanent residence of a disabled veteran who has a total and permanent service-connected disability or who received benefits for specially adapted housing. There is no age or income limitation for this program.

 Increasing eligibility
Under HB 59, a provision would be added to the program for elderly citizens and those with disabilities who are married. Currently, income cannot exceed $37,900 for a married couple. It would increase by 15% to $43,585 for a couple under HB 59.
Also, a new income eligibility provision would be added to the Circuit Breaker program. A household of two earning up to 70% of area median income (AMI) would qualify. Currently, the income limit is $56,850. Paré noted that the income limit for Wake County would jump to $68,495 for the Circuit Breaker program under HB 59.
“By connecting this to average median income, we’re trying to apply it uniformly, but it really addresses more of those high cost of living areas where there’s move of a problem,” Paré said.
For some counties, Paré said, existing program qualifications and income eligibility requirements will be better than those proposed under HB 59.
Counties would absorb tax revenue losses if HB 59 becomes law, Paré said when asked by Rep. James Roberson (D-Wake) if Wake County leaders were prepared for such a scenario. Paré estimates tax revenue losses of $15 million for Wake County if the bill becomes law.
“What I can tell you Rep. Roberson, there’s nothing in the bill that makes a county whole as a result of this by the state, if that is what you’re asking me,” Paré said.
Paré added that she worked with the Wake County Tax Administrator Marcus Kinrade and others on the bill.
“He’s [Kinrade] obviously the tax administrator and not an elected county commissioner, but I would say that in my discussions with county commissioners, that they have been looking for this, wanting to support something like this,” Paré said.
  Rep. Donny Lambeth (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) said he welcomes legislation to ease tax burdens for senior citizens and other populations vulnerable to rising property taxes.
“I hear this a lot from senior citizens in my district because property taxes, in fact, have gone up so much over the last 10 years for houses and house values have gone up, so it it’s become a big issue, particularly in my county,” Lambeth said. “I think you have come up with a reasonable solution. Will there be some impact to the counties? Yes, but I don’t think that there will be a major impact to the counties, so I wholeheartedly support doing something to try to help these individuals.”
 Residents and advocates weigh in
John Adcock, a Wake County resident, spoke in favor of the bill, noting that Wake County has raised property taxes four consecutive years. Adcock said his tax bill has increased 43% since 2020. And while he would not qualify for the tax help under HB 59, Adcock said his mother would if she were still alive and the bill became law.
“If she had lived to this year, her property taxes on her residence would have increased by 85% over the last five years for life,” Adcock said. “It’s my belief that my mother would have qualified for this exclusion, and by operation of this bill, her tax bill would be cut in half for 2026.”
He said property tax hikes, increases in insurance premiums and local government sales taxes all contribute to the “financial burden of homeownership.”
“From a Wake County residence perspective, the way county commissioners have talked about housing affordability, yet their tax policies say the exact opposite” Adcock said. “By the adoption of this bill, the General Assembly will have a direct and tangible impact on housing affordability for those that qualify for this exemption.”
  Mary Bethel (Photo: NC Coalition on Aging)
Mary Bethel, chairwoman of the North Carolina Coalition on Aging, said transportation was the biggest issue people faced 40 years ago when she began advocating for seniors. The big issue now, she said, is concern about property taxes.
“We constantly hear from people, particularly those as Rep. Paré said have been in their homes for decades, who basically cannot afford their property taxes,” Bethel said. “This is happening not only in large metropolitan areas like Wake County where you’ve got a lot of big homes that are expensive, going up in neighborhoods that have lower income homes, but it’s also happening in smaller counties too where the property tax base is their primary source of revenue, so it’s a big issue.”
Bethel said a provision that would remove the tax deferment from the Circuit Breaker program would likely encourage more people to use the program. She said the program isn’t utilized as much as others because homeowners don’t want heirs to inherit their debt.
“It’s going to take a lot of education of older adults and persons with disabilities to assure them their property is not going to have a lean placed on it,” Bethel said. “I think this is a step in the right direction.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Property-taxes-iStock-Getty.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 05:01:56.870275

[…]","Getty Images.A Franklin County judge said Ohio’s private school voucher program is unconstitutional in a ruling this week. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost’s office is planning an appeal of the decision.
The court granted a summary judgment, which is a ruling that comes from a judge without the need for a full trial in the case.
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Jaiza Page said the General Assembly has “exceedingly broad powers to tax, organize, administer and control the common school system,” but those powers “do not include unlimited discretion.”
The judge pushed back on private school voucher supporters’ claims that the program is a subsidy program providing scholarships, rather than a separate system of schools.
The idea of the “EdChoice” vouchers as a scholarship program instead of a system of schools “is mere semantics,” Page wrote, due to the fact that the state pays schools directly, rather than parents.
“More importantly, private schools participating in EdChoice receive substantially more state funding per student than public schools,” Page wrote. “Where EdChoice participating private schools are inexplicably receiving double the per-pupil state funding than public schools, it is difficult to say that EdChoice is simply a scholarship that follows and/or benefits the students as opposed to a system that benefits private schools.”
The state spent nearly $1 billion on private school vouchers in 2024 alone as near-universal eligibility was approved by the Ohio General Assembly.
The ruling rejected one of the claims from voucher opponents, an accusation that the voucher program created segregation in public schools as white students leave to attend private schools. The judge said no evidence of “discriminatory intent” was shown.
Though the judge ruled the voucher program unconstitutional, she allowed the program to continue “in recognition that this decision may cause significant changes to school funding in Ohio and the high likelihood that the parties will immediately appeal.”
Public school advocates praised the decision as not just a good one, but the constitutionally correct one.
“Any ruling different than the one we got would have been a horrific surprise and a mistake according to the constitution,” said William Phillis, executive director of the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding, one of the leaders of the lawsuit.
A spokesperson for Senate President Rob McColley said the suit was “a shameful case of bench-shopping from a radical organization that prefers to vilify parents and children who simply want a better educational environment than they have now.”
A history lesson
The lawsuit was a constitutional challenge to Ohio’s private school voucher program. It started in January 2022, when opponents of the program filed their case in Franklin County, alleging violations of two clauses of the Ohio Constitution.
The first was a claim that the voucher program violated the requirement in the constitution that the state support a “thorough and efficient” system of public education, and the second claim alleged a violation of the state’s equal protection clause.
The case included an attempt to question Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman back when he was the Senate’s president, about legislative measures to support the voucher program and the process of implementing the program statewide. Huffman fought a subpoena and argued he had nothing to share in a deposition, adding that legislative privilege protected him from such questioning.
The court allowed Huffman to avoid an in-person deposition, instead requiring him to submit to written questioning, a decision he appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court.
Many Ohio school districts signed on to the lawsuit, including districts in Columbus, Cleveland Heights-University Heights, Richmond Heights, Huffman’s hometown of Lima, and Barberton. Individuals and parents of students also joined as parties to the lawsuit.
The schools and voucher opponents argued the funding that was being given as part of the program was taking away funding from public schools, who serve the vast majority of students in Ohio.
Page noted in her decision that in fiscal year 2022, more than $300 million went to about 575 chartered non-public schools through the voucher program, and of the schools that received the funds, 154 were given voucher funds for 75% or more of their enrolled students.
The judge also brought up arguments from certain schools who joined the lawsuit, who said “inadequate funding” has caused lay offs or suspensions of teachers and staff, causing overcrowded classrooms and insufficient support.
Page said the amount of records in the case “is unquestionably voluminous,” with reference materials “from before Ohio’s statehood up to the General Assembly’s modification of EdChoice in (Ohio House Bill) 33,” the previous state budget bill.
The 47-page court decision included its own history of school funding legislation and legal battles, which included education debates at “the forefront of Ohio’s leaders’ decision-making during the (state) Constitutional Convention of 1850.”
Ultimately, out of that convention came the current language of the constitution, requiring the General Assembly to “secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state; but no religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any part of the school funds of this state.”
Several state constitutional conventions attempted to change this wording, even proposing leaving out the “religious or other sect” language.
Delegates at an 1873 convention said removing the language on religious sects would “leave the Constitution so crippled that the various religious denominations may divide the common school fund among them, for the support of sectarian schools.”
“The moment we consent to do so, we deal the death blow to the system of common schools, upon which expanded and improved by increasing experience and wisdom, more than upon anything else … depends the perpetuity and efficiency of our American institutions and government,” another delegate said in 1873.
‘School choice’
Private school voucher supporters, including Ohio’s legislative leaders and Gov. Mike DeWine, have argued Ohioans should be free to choose the school they want to send their students to, instead of being tied down to “underperforming” public schools in the area in which they live. The mantra of “school choice” is one that has sounded from Republican state leaders and federal GOP leaders alike.
In Tuesday’s ruling, Page said the non-public schools who receive private school vouchers are largely religious, and are able to deny enrollment to students based on their own standards.
These schools aren’t subject to anti-discrimination laws, Page wrote, therefore they can turn students away based on religion, sexual orientation or disability.
“By bestowing participating private religious schools with complete control over prospective students’ participation, the ‘school choice’ here is made by the private school, not ‘as the result of independent decisions of parents and students,’” Page wrote, citing previous case law.
The Catholic Conference of Ohio released a statement expressing their disappointment in the ruling, but also emphasizing their confidence that the private voucher program “will prevail” on appeal.
“The Catholic Church will continue to advocate for and defend programs that support parents as the primary educators of their children and enable them to select a school that best suits their child’s needs,” the statement from conference Executive Director Brian Hickey said.
The heads of Ohio’s education unions said the ruling was just a confirmation of what public schools have known already, “that Ohio’s unsustainable and costly private school vouchers are draining public funds and preventing legislators from fully funding the quality public school education that every child … is entitled to under the Ohio Constitution,” as Ohio Federation of Teachers leader Melissa Cropper put it.
Ohio Education Association President Scott DiMauro said though he expects this ruling to be the first step in a longer process through appeals, the ruling “represents a huge victory for Ohio’s public school educators, school communities and students.”
“The work does not stop here,” DiMauro said in a statement. “But I am confident this initial ruling will ultimately stand up through the appeals process, and Ohio can once again dedicate its resources fully to funding our public schools and ensuring all Ohio students can get the world-class education they deserve – no exceptions.”
A request for comment from House Speaker Matt Huffman was unreturned as of Wednesday afternoon.

Ned Lamont was asked Wednesday about the stunning victory in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary by a 33-year-old socialist, Zohran Mamdani, over the 67-year-old former governor, Andrew Cuomo, whom Lamont had recently, if awkwardly, identified as his favorite. 
“Mamdani ran a hell of a race, didn’t he?” Lamont said, as a Democratic Party in the throes of an identity crisis rushed to find larger meaning in the upset. “He surprised the hell out of the establishment world down there. And I salute him for the job he was able to get done.”
Elected Democrats in Connecticut, Lamont included, called Mamdani’s victory significant for his youth and message, while most also cautioned against instantly proclaiming him as the answer to what went wrong in the 2024 presidential race.
The premise of generational change embodied by a candidate promising things largely anathema to Lamont — higher taxes on the rich, free buses, universal child care, a freeze on rents of rent-controlled apartments — comes during a particularly difficult week for a 71-year-old Connecticut governor whose brand is fiscal discipline and stability.
Lamont vetoed two bills placed on his desk by the Democratic majorities of the General Assembly, acts that reinforced his political identity as a centrist — an image that makes him a formidable opponent for a Republican challenger should Lamont seek a third term in 2026 — but antagonized the left of his own party.
At a press conference Monday explaining the vetoes of an affordable housing bill and a measure that would have provided jobless benefits for strikers, Lamont also made an unforced error: identifying Cuomo, who resigned after a sexual harassment scandal, as his preferred candidate for mayor.
On Wednesday, Lamont praised Mamdani while noting that Democrats have hardly renounced centrists. He pointed to Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats recently nominated moderate suburban women for governor. 
But the governor readily conceded Mamdani’s win demonstrated an appetite for change — and he claimed some common ground.
“There’s a lot of frustration out there,” Lamont said. “And some of what Mamdani was saying, we’ve already done. He’s making a big down payment on universal pre-K. You know, we’re doing that as well.”
Lamont says the highlight of the recently concluded legislative session was the creation of an off-budget early childhood trust fund that will raise salaries for child care workers, increase access and provide free care for families earning no more than $100,000 and discounted care for others. 
“So I share a lot of his aspirations, where he wants to go,” Lamont said of Mamdani. “We probably get there in different ways.”
Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, a candidate for governor if Lamont does not run again, said Mamdani won by talking about affordability.
“Clearly, those issues spoke to people,” Bysiewicz said.
Mamdani, who was endorsed by the union-financed Working Families Party, ran on a promise to increase affordable housing, open city-owned grocery stores and raise the city’s $16.50 hourly minimum wage to $30. 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said he found Mamdani’s victory easy to analyze.
“It is so easy to see right now that people are hungry for fighters. They’re hungry for people to be authentic,” Duff said. “They’re hungry for people to stand up and give people a voice. And they may not always have to agree with you, but they will respect the fact that you stood up and you fought for them and their values.”
Lamont’s two recent vetoes put him at odds with labor, affordable housing advocates and fellow Democrats, including Duff.
His veto of the strikers bill was expected and came with a consistent and clearly stated rationale. But his veto of an affordable housing bill that had been drafted largely to his specifications infuriated lawmakers. 
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, was bracing for hard questions about the housing veto Wednesday night at a House Democratic caucus. Ritter and House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, had called the vote on the housing bill after assuring the rank-and-file Lamont was on board.
“So we’re going to get some flack from this, from people who are going to say, ‘Well, you guys said, ‘It was all set.’ And we’re going to say, ‘We thought it was all set.’ And so it’s not good for anybody,” Ritter said. “It’s not good for him, it’s not good for us.”
A leader in Connecticut For All, one of the liberal advocacy groups that have clashed with Lamont over state spending, was quick to assert that Mamdani’s win was a rebuke to Lamont and his style of governing.
“Tonight’s NYC Mayor results sent a strong message to corporate democrats like Governor Lamont — it’s time for bold leadership that centers the needs of the working class,” Constanza Segovia, an organizer, said in an emailed statement Tuesday night. “Lamont’s endorsement for an accused sexual harasser and disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo is indicative of all of his choices lately — wrong and out of touch.”
Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, a liberal weighing a run for governor, was reluctant to find evidence of vulnerability by Lamont in Cuomo’s defeat — in part because of one of same factors cited by Segovia, the sexual harassment scandal that dogs the former New York governor.
“You need to be really aware of luck — and that’s not to in any way detract from that race — but I think that Mamdani got lucky to be against a truly unsympathetic competitor, where Ned is a nice guy and is really likable,” Elliott said.
Ritter had a similar take: Cuomo’s problem was less being a moderate than not getting past the scandal that led to his resignation.
“I think it’s time for him to go and retire,” Ritter said of Cuomo. “But my reasons for that are not because he’s moderate. My reasons are because of his actions.”
Comptroller Sean Scanlon,  a potential gubernatorial candidate if Lamont does not run, said he was unsure if the granular details of Mamdani’s platform were a formula path for Democrats elsewhere.
“But I certainly think he ran an incredible campaign,” Scanlon said. “And I think there is a yearning right now amongst not just Democratic voters but all voters, for young, energetic candidates that are laying out a vision for where they want to take their city or their state or the country, and focusing on affordability, which is the No. 1 issue to everybody in this country, and something that we as Democrats don’t talk about enough.”
Scanlon is a fan of “Abundance,” the new book by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. As Klein recently observed on the New York Times op-ed page, “The book is largely a critique of how Democrats have governed in the places where they’ve held power.”
“His main take, and I agree with it, is that Democrats have become the party of defending institutions that most people think are broken, and explaining why things are complicated and hard, as opposed to being willing to just break things that are wrong,” Scanlon said. “And I think we have become victims of that reality and letting perfect be the enemy of the good.”
Scanlon also offered a pithier assessment.
 “I have been saying this to a lot of people today: Young plus change, plus focus on affordability — minus socialism — is the recipe for Connecticut Democrats.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SRR_0456-TRANSIT-0625-DE-140-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 05:01:56.870275

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — A Maryland man facing criminal charges in Tennessee, after being wrongly deported to El Salvador, will remain in jail until at least Friday as a federal judge weighs whether prosecutors have the power to keep him from being “precipitously deported.”
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, appeared Wednesday in a downtown Nashville courtroom for a hearing to set the conditions of his release while a criminal case against him moves forward. 
Abrego was indicted by a Tennessee grand jury June 6 on two criminal human smuggling charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment occurred while Abrego was housed in a Salvadoran prison, where U.S. immigration officials dispatched him after a routine traffic stop.
 A Department of Justice attorney later conceded Abrego’s deportation had been a mistake. His case has come to symbolize the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. 
Wearing an orange jumpsuit and seated next to his attorneys, Abrego occasionally glanced in the direction of the gallery where his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, sat in the first row. It was the couple’s wedding anniversary, she told reporters earlier in the day.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to appear in court for possible release, a move federal prosecutors oppose

But as Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes went over the terms of Abregos’s pretrial release, defense attorneys raised the specter that he could instead face deportation. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are expected to take Abrego into custody immediately once he is released by the federal court. 
Sean Hecker, an attorney for Abrego, sought a decision by the judge that Abrego’s release would be conditional on prosecutors working to ensure that he would not be deported while the case remains ongoing.
Hecker also sought assurances that Abrego would not be housed in Texas, Louisiana or other parts of the country that could impede access to his attorneys.
In support of his request, Hecker noted prosecutors and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had a history of coordination and cooperation in Abrego’s case.  
DHS and federal prosecutors coordinated to bring charges against Abrego, including facilitating his return from El Salvador to face an indictment in Tennessee; they also established agreements with potential witnesses against Abrego to halt their own deportation cases, Hecker said. 
But acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire indicated he could make no promises about either Abrego’s placement in an ICE facility accessible to his attorneys or to prevent his deportation. He told the court that he would “do his best.”

“I will coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, but obviously I can’t tell them what to do,” he said. McGuire noted that ICE — a department within the federal homeland security agency — is not a party to the case.
McGuire had unsuccessfully sought to keep Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who typically oversee detainees awaiting trial on federal crimes. 
In an order issued over the weekend, Holmes denied the prosecutors’ petition, ruling that Abrego had a right to release while awaiting trial.
“These are the sort of practical implications of that (the judge’s decision),” McGuire said Wednesday. 
Holmes has given attorneys until noon Friday to submit legal arguments that address the question of “what can the government do to ensure Mr. Abrego will not be precipitously deported.”
Prosecutors, meanwhile, are pursuing an appeal of Holmes’ weekend decision to release Abrego.  
U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, Jr., separately on Wednesday, set a July 16 hearing day to review prosecutors’ request to revoke Abrego’s release from the custody of U.S. Marshals. 
The criminal charges Abrego faces stem from a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Abrego was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop alleged the trip was part of a years-long human smuggling scheme in which Abrego was a paid driver who transported migrants who illegally crossed the southern border to destinations across the country.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Tennessee’s free newsletter to keep up with statewide education policy and Memphis-Shelby County Schools.
As Tennessee lawmakers debated a new universal voucher program earlier this year, one financial analysis projected that 65% of vouchers would go to students already enrolled in private schools.
Now, it will be impossible to determine whether that projection was accurate.
Tennessee families do not have to report their previous school enrollment in the new statewide voucher program application, a gap that will leave Tennesseans in the dark about whether the program will significantly expand private school access for public school students or send millions in public funds to students already enrolled in private schools.
State education officials won’t explain why they aren’t asking about prior enrollment, data which is regularly collected by other states administering similar voucher programs.
The Tennessee Department of Education has not responded to Chalkbeat Tennessee inquiries about the decision and whether the state intends to collect additional information in the future.
In a statement, Gov. Bill Lee’s office said the legislation enacting the program did not require the state to collect the information.
The lack of data collection on these issues is a notable departure from the state’s initial voucher program, the Education Savings Accounts initiative. The program, available in three counties since 2022, continues to require parents to report the specific school their child was previously enrolled in to apply.
The new voucher program application also does not require families to report household income if they are applying for one of the 10,000 available slots without an income cap.
Tennessee launched applications in mid-May for the program, which will provide 20,000 students with about $7,295 to spend at private schools. In the first year, half of the vouchers are set aside for families who earn below a certain income cap, with the other “universal” half open to all applicants.
Rep. Caleb Hemmer, a Democrat from Nashville who has been critical of the Lee-backed voucher program, has requested further information from state education officials about why they’re collecting less data about students in a significantly expanded program.
“Even if you’re pro-voucher, you would think you’d want some of this information so you could see where these parents are moving their kids from,” Hemmer said.
The new application stands in stark contrast to similar voucher programs around the country.
States like Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, and Alabama regularly collect and publish data surrounding previous school enrollment, and lawmakers have used similar data as a marker to gauge which communities the programs are reaching. In March, Alabama officials released data showing more than 66% of applicants to the program were already private school or homeschooled students. The first year Florida’s voucher program expanded, the state released data showing about 69% of students were already enrolled in private schools.
Hemmer sharply criticized the Tennessee Department of Education this week, questioning whether it was a calculated decision to “shield some of this information so they don’t have to worry about negative headlines.”
“It’s a new program, and these data collections are very crucial to understanding how and if these programs work,” Hemmer said. “This is a signature initiative of the governor. I would think the governor’s office and the Department of Education commissioner in charge of managing this would want to know everything possible in how this is operating.”
K-12 Education Subcommittee Chairman Kirk Haston, a Republican from Lobelville, said he was less concerned with the lack of prior enrollment information and suggested the new voucher application shouldn’t be compared to the previous program.
“One of the key pieces of data to me is if the funds are getting back to Tennessee taxpaying parents,” Haston said.
State officials have remained tight-lipped about many details of the EFS application process through the summer. The governor’s office has appeared closely involved in communications about the program, which has been Lee’s signature issue for many years.
In May, following media inquiries, Lee’s office and TDOE released a joint statement noting that more than 33,000 people had applied for the program.
How many applicants the state has accepted or denied is not yet clear.
The TDOE has not responded to Chalkbeat Tennessee requests this summer for how many applicants have been accepted or provided specific information on whether the department has filled 11 positions the legislature funded to help administer the voucher program.

When the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee earlier this month released its piece of a federal budget bill, Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., said it took a “commonsense approach” to the federal Supplemental Assistance to Needy Families, or SNAP program. 
However, the approach could also be seen as an unfunded mandate to states and local governments — and an attempt to hassle some of the most vulnerable off of a program meant to keep them from going hungry, critics say. 
The changes to the program colloquially known as food stamps are part of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which faces a July 4 deadline. 
It would give $4.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. In an analysis, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, estimated that 70% of the benefit would go to the “top 10% of the income distribution.” 
Many unaware of threats to Ohio Medicaid, advocates say

To try to pay for it, congressional Republicans want to slash federal programs for the poor. They include cuts to Medicaid that could cost 770,000 Ohioans their health coverage. 
They also include an estimated $300 billion in cuts to SNAP — by far the largest in history. That would cost millions of children, elderly, disabled and working Americans nutrition assistance, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported. About one in nine Ohioans would be among them.
Anti-hunger advocates are scrambling to keep up with whether the provisions in the Senate Agriculture committee bill will meet parliamentary muster. But they seek to shift the burden onto states in multiple ways.
One is to increase states’ share of the cost to administer the program from 50% to 75%. Another is to make states start paying a share of the program cost based on their error rates.
The two measures would work together to dramatically increase state costs and fundamentally alter the program, said Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks. 
“There are underlying, systemic threats to the benefits of every eligible person because of the way the reconciliation package is designed,” Novotny said Wednesday. “I fundamentally believe that every child — if they’re seven or 10 or 14 — if they’re in a household in need of benefits, we need to make sure they’re nourished and that we live up to the commitment that we collectively made as a country.”
The program provides debit cards for food. To qualify, Ohio recipients generally have to have net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four. Benefits averaged $6.28 per person, per day last year.
The reconciliation bill would force states to pay for part of the program on a sliding scale based on error rates. They’d have to pay starting at 5% and up depending on how often they were found to pay recipients too little or too much in benefits. 
It also would greatly increase error rates by eliminating the current tolerance for small errors — those up to $57.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services and the large counties that administer the program gather information on gross income, family characteristics and living expenses to determine eligibility, and at what level. 
“It’s really complicated, but that determines what eligibility is for that household,” Novotny said. “If at any point in that process, there is any error made at all — if the benefit amount is calculated a dollar too low or a dollar too high — that will count toward the error rate. 
“Right now there’s a certain level of forgiveness because of the complexity of the calculation, but that would end. The error rate will go up. It will be impossible for a state to stay below a threshold of 5% because we’re talking about millions and millions of touches.”
If Ohio had an error rate of 6% or less — which it doesn’t, even under the current, more-tolerant system — the state would have to pay $158 million more a year into the program, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. At the top end, with an error rate of 25% or more, Ohio would have to pay $790 million more a year.
Under Ohio’s most recent, more-forgivingly calculated error rate, 15%, the state would have to come up with $473 million a year.
“An error rate is not fraud,” Novotny said. “It’s not the fault of the person applying for benefits. It’s a worker or a computer system making an error.”
In addition, by forcing states to pick up a huge additional chunk of the cost to administer the system, error rates stand to go up even further.
Ohio’s benefits system is now so under-resourced that SNAP beneficiaries face a two-to-three-hour wait time when they call to start or annually re-enroll for benefits, for their six-month check-ins, and when they need to report material changes in income, Novotny said. Adding 50% to states’ administrative burden would only increase wait times and the chances for harried workers to make mistakes, she said.
“Our system is already under a lot of duress in terms of access,” Novotny said.
She added, “People have trouble getting through the system already. That’s already part of the program. That’s not new. What the reconciliation text would do is exacerbate that in many ways. It would take away federal funding to support that process. So the state and the counties would have to invest more in just maintaining that level of service, which is already underfunded. And it would introduce additional complexity into every touch that is made with every household.”
On Tuesday, Novotny traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with aides to Ohio Sens. Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, both Republicans. She said neither official is on the Agriculture Committee and she wanted to explain how the SNAP changes would manifest in Ohio.
“We’re trying to talk to them about the impact it would have on Ohio,” she said. “It really is a serious, permanent, structural change to the program that we believe should be undertaken much more thoughtfully.”

Jeff Crossman, speaking, alongside former Democratic Attorney General Marc Dann. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)A pair of former Democratic state lawmakers warned the General Assembly not to approve a controversial plan to pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium and other sports facilities in the future. State lawmakers went ahead anyway.
The state budget, approved Wednesday afternoon, includes a provision to take ownership of unclaimed funds that have been in state custody for more than 10 years. It’s a dramatic change for the state.
To this point, Ohio has followed the broadly agreed upon best practice of holding funds in perpetuity until a claimant comes forward.

“These are funds held in trust. This is not state property,” attorney and former state Rep. Jeff Crossman argued. “These funds belong to all those hardworking Ohioans across the state with forgotten savings accounts, uncashed checks, overpaid utility bills — they’re not abandoned.”
Crossman and former Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann, who is also a former state senator, have put together a class action lawsuit, and they’re promising to file it immediately if the stadium funding plan gets signed into law.
“We’re not anti-stadium,” Crossman insisted. “We’re anti-theft.”
Is that legal?
Although Ohio’s proposal is a sharp departure from current state policy, it’s not the first time a state has imposed a deadline on unclaimed funds.
A small handful of states have a statutory cutoff after which funds become state property — a process known as “escheatment.” But those states wait more than twice as long as Ohio is proposing or limit the process to small dollar amounts.
Muddying the waters further, Ohio lawmakers have dipped into the unclaimed funds account several times in recent years.
The plan’s architect, state Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, points to those transfers as vindication. Importantly, those previous transfers amount to borrowing money; unlike Cirino’s plan, no one lost the right to reclaim their property.
Can they do that? Ohio Senators propose novel, if questionable, Browns stadium funding plan

Crossman and Dann acknowledge it is legal for the government to take ownership of private property, but only in extraordinary circumstances. They insist the state hasn’t met that bar.
“This is an unconstitutional taking of property,” Dann argued.
He brought up a 2006 eminent domain case in Ohio called Norwood v. Horney. The city of Norwood wanted to seize dozens of homes and businesses to make way for private development. The Ohio Supreme Court rejected that effort.
“The government cannot take private property based on speculative claims of economic benefit alone,” Dann explained. “There must be a legitimate, direct public purpose. This plan fails on both fronts.”
Crossman added that while the Norwood case dealt with real estate, the court made no distinction between real property and any other.
“And let me be blunt,” he insisted, “if this plan collapses in court and delays stadium funding, it’s not going to be our fault. It’s going to be the legislature’s fault, who forced this through knowing full well that it was unconstitutional.”
What’s next?
Following his chamber’s vote, Senate President Rob McColley said “I’m confident we’re on good constitutional grounds.” He added he’s skeptical Dann and Crossman will be able to prove their clients have suffered actual damages from the changes.
“Because everybody who has money in the fund still has 10 years to come get the money,” he argued, alluding to a ten-year grace period for those whose funds are part of the first wave swept into stadium fund.
“And so there is no harm, there are no damages for those individuals,” McColley added. “So I think it’s going to be a tough case for them to prove all the way up.”
In addition to establishing a new funding stream for the Browns stadium, lawmakers added in a provision that will likely make it easier for the team to pick up stakes in Cleveland, and settle in nearby Brook Park instead. After Art Modell moved the first iteration of the Browns to Baltimore, rechristening the team as the Ravens, lawmakers placed restrictions on owners moving teams after receiving public support.
The budget tweaked that provision. It now only applies when moving a team out of state.
McColley defended the change, arguing it still requires teams fulfill the terms of their lease and that tethering the team to its current location was never the intention. “That would have been an insane intention to have when the law was passed,” he added.
“What this is doing is protecting the taxpayers,” McColley argued. “Basically saying you have to fill out your lease, you have to satisfy your obligation, and if you receive state funding, you have to remain in the state of Ohio.”
Despite criticism of the plan, lawmakers are certainly treating it as a going concern. The Senate’s budget calls for transferring $1.7 billion out of the unclaimed funds trust, but that first draft only appropriated the $600 million the Browns want for their stadium.
But after negotiations with the House, lawmakers want to appropriate a full $1 billion for sports and cultural developments. That puts $400 million at the ready for other facilities around Ohio.

“They’re saying we don’t care that you own this money,” Dann argued, “We don’t care that we’ve appointed ourselves, the state, as the fiduciary for that money. We’re going to just dump that responsibility right now and give it out to somebody who has helped us in our campaigns. That is not a constitutional process.”
Gov. Mike DeWine could always veto the provision, but to this point he has declined to take a position on using unclaimed funds. However, DeWine’s spokesman Dan Tierney criticized the preemptive lawsuit threat.
“Wow,” he said in an email. “We haven’t even received the budget bill yet, let alone the Governor having signed it. But given that the former Attorney General gave us the Sunshine Express, his need for speed shouldn’t be surprising.”
During his time as attorney general, Dann added flames to the side of a government SUV and decals dubbing it the Sunshine Express to highlight his office’s work on public records. But that SUV wound up at the shop in the first place because a staffer in Dann’s office turned it in with extensive body damage and no explanation.
But for their part, Dann and Crossman expressed some optimism that DeWine might step in.
“Republicans do not have the corner on bad ideas in this building,” Dann said, arguing Democrats have been on the wrong side of plenty of unconstitutional proposals. “Our hope is that the serious legislators and the governor who stood on these steps and swore an oath to the Constitution will decide to follow the Constitution.”
Crossman added that as a former attorney general himself, DeWine “should recognize the constitutional problems.”
“You can’t balance a budget on broken promises, and you can’t build a stadium on stolen property,” Crossman argued. “And if the legislature won’t defend Ohioans’ rights, we will.”

(Traci Brimhall)Kansas poet laureate Traci Brimhall is offering poetic sustenance to Kansas and beyond.
Brimhall, two years into her term, is busy, and her appointment has seen an outpouring of support and excitement. It is a testament to her commitment to Kansas and poetry. Brimhall’s latest poetry book, “Love Prodigal,” was shortlisted for the Julie Suk Award, which recognizes the best poetry book published in 2025 by a literary press. The Guggenheim New York, in collaboration with the Academy of American Poets, has announced Brimhall as their poet in residence for 2025. 
I’m in awe of Brimhall. She has maintained such a high level of poetic output and programming across Kansas while still serving as the director of the creative writing program at Kansas State University and teaching as a distinguished professor of English at the university.
I asked Brimhall how the laureateship has impacted her teaching and how the University has supported her new role.
  Traci Brimhall
“One really great direct benefit to my teaching is that I’ve been able to make several internships for students to help with laureate projects,” she said. “I’m glad I can fund students to do work in arts advocacy. And I am really grateful that Kansas State has been so enthusiastic about my work as laureate. Different departments have invited me to give talks; I’ve done a university podcast on food and poetry; and I gave the commencement speech for the College of Arts & Sciences last spring. I feel arts and humanities often feel overlooked in many academic spaces, and it is wonderful that a land grant institution that has a lot of agricultural focus can also see the value of the arts.”
Poetry is growing in Kansas with each event Brimhall facilitates, and there have been many. In Poetry Harvest: Poems for the 2024 Kansas State Fair, she curated new works from Kansas poets to showcase at the event, which is held annually in Hutchinson. Thematically, the poems were predominantly agrarian and included quilting, dairy, woodworking, farming, horses, flower displays, and much more. A deep pride and sense of place are apparent. 
Brimhall has stated in her op-ed about the state fair poems that she is working to “unite the state’s agricultural roots and the literary arts.”
“Since so much of my Laureate work has been about connecting food and poetry, the Kansas State Fair seemed like a natural fit!” Brimhall shared. “There are already so many exhibits about food and the arts, and I wanted to see poetry included among the other domestic arts like quilting and flower arranging. I was lucky in that both the State Fair and the Kansas Chamber of Commerce were also excited because I couldn’t have done it alone. I paired 20 Kansas poets with 20 exhibits around the fair, and we put those poems on posters that got displayed across the fair for two weeks. And we even got to organize a poetry reading on one of the stages!”
She continues bringing poets to the table. During one library talk, the community had a potluck lunch. That’s further evidence of the cultivation of care that arises from within the places Brimhall visits.
“Southwest Kansas! A library did a potluck lunch to feed everyone, and someone told me that they were afraid of poetry before my talk,” she said. “They also said that my recipe cards for poetry lines helped them write their very first poem. That felt really special, and I hope they write many, many more poems.” 
Community through communion is how Brimhall is bringing the culinary and literary arts together. There is nourishment and fulfillment to be found in her work. Her most recent creative endeavor is a poetry cookbook.
“I wanted to connect more culinary arts with the literary arts, so I asked 20 chefs across Kansas to contribute recipes,” Brimhall said. “There are food trucks and farms and restaurateurs and Netflix chefs all participating and offering recipes. I asked them to make the recipes accessible for all Kansan — so economically accessible and easily sourced. Ten percent of the cookbook copies will be donated to food banks across the state. I then paired 20 poets with those 20 recipes and had them write response poems.”
Meadowlark Press, a Kansas press in Emporia, is publishing “Eat Your Words: A Kansas Poetry Cookbook.” That’s intentional.
“For me, it was important that all the funds go to supporting Kansas literary endeavors,” Brimhall said. “I want to see our State’s arts economy thrive.”
Brimhall is in full stride as she continues to travel across the state with poetry in hand. And I am beyond excited to read her latest collection of poetry, “Love Prodigal” (Copper Canyon Press, 2024). 
In a stunning interview on KPR Presents, Brimhall spoke about her latest book and shared that she wants “love to be the energy that fuels her art.” It’s apparent to me that at the center of her work is love. We are fortunate to have Traci Brimhall as our state’s poet laureate. She is pouring so much care into Kansas in the form of a poem. I look forward to what the next two years will bring.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)For those who care about the future of life on earth and the destiny of our children, there is nothing more frightening than watching the fossil fuel greed-induced blindness of Trump and the MAGA cult ruthlessly wiping out every single gain toward preventing a climate collapse and opening the door to a deadly acceleration of carbon emissions. 
It is no time to mince words, we are witnessing nothing less than the last chance to prevent the overwhelming suffering of literally hundreds of millions of our own children and future generations as the life support systems of the planet are irreparably crushed.
Here in Ohio we have our own version of this horrendous scenario playing out. 
Seemingly blinded by greed to the point where they do not even see the consequences for their very own children, fossil fuel interests in our state — aided and abetted by similarly blinded Republicans in the Ohio Statehouse — have now embarked on an effort to do no less than completely shut down utility scale solar projects. 
They are doing so through two primary vehicles. One is to use their exorbitant wealth to spread distortions and misinformation to the public in areas where solar projects are proposed. 
The second is to infiltrate their influence directly into the agency that makes solar project siting decisions — the Ohio Power Siting board (OPSB) — and skew the process so radically that pro-solar advocates are left with hardly any chance to ever win.
In this running battle over the green future of Ohio, one area that stands out in importance is the Frasier solar project in Knox County. 
It does so because nowhere else in the state have the lines of the conflict been drawn more clearly. It started with the fossil fuel industry blatantly jumping into the fray without even any real attempt to conceal its identity. 
As is usually the case, it formed a local “front group” — called “Knox Smart Development” — but it was obvious where the money and propaganda were coming from.
While trying to ban anyone from outside the county to even testify, they invited a speaker all the way from Chicago to attend a so-called “town hall” meeting where the climate crisis was characterized as a complete hoax. 
He came from the Heartland Institute — the very same source hired by the tobacco industry to spread lies about smoking not being a danger to health.  
In this same “town hall” — the concept known for democratically allowing all points of view — a speaker who came to present a pro-solar view was actually denied entry.   
Next was the extreme step of actually purchasing the local newspaper so it could be used as a tool to spread misinformation. 
This was exposed by a national group called ProPublica — which has actually won the coveted Pulitzer Prize for the excellence of its investigative work. 
All this manipulation was not allowed to hide in the dark. Not only were commentaries published here in the Capital Journal, but a documentary to expose the corruption was produced by this writer and distributed throughout the county.

But the Frasier battle is also notable because it will put to the test two strategies that are now becoming prominent in the effort to shut down utility scale solar. 
The first is the manipulative claim that agricultural land is being “taken out of production.” 
The solar developer for Frasier — Open Road Renewables — has designed the project so that sheep grazing will be integrated into almost the entire acreage. Continued agricultural use has now been specifically designed into the project. 
Yet the opposition continues to hold the signs and yell the same words despite the point now being rendered meaningless. Will they be allowed to get away with this?
Frasier will also crystallize whether the attempt by fossil fuel interests to skew the entire decision process will be successful. 
They are doing so by getting the Ohio Power Siting Board to essentially grant “veto power” over projects to a small handful of local officials — despite the fact there’s actually a state statute that prohibits the granting of such local jurisdiction.  
Even more unbelievably, these local officials are not even being asked to present *any rationale* whatsoever for *WHY*  they oppose a project.
All they do is say no, and the extra power they have been given results in the project being rejected. 
It is the antithesis of a democratic process. 
Fossil fuel pressure can be applied to just a few select individuals and once they are “locked” into the opposition, not even a majority of the public has any ability to affect the outcome. 
The power siting board has objected to calling this a “rigging” of the process. But in all honesty what else can it be called? The legality of this bald-faced power grab is now being deliberated at the Ohio Supreme Court.   
Ohio is not just one state among many. 
It is the fifth most prolific producer of carbon emissions, placing an immense weight of responsibility on our shoulders related to our children and future generations. 
Jake Zuckerman reported for Cleveland.com in March: “Ohioans and their elected representatives have killed enough solar development to roughly power the state’s three largest cities in the three years since state lawmakers passed one of the nation’s most stringent restrictions on new solar development.”
The stakes are high, and our planet is currently losing. 
The Ohio Power Siting Board cannot claim ignorance of the issues. It has acknowledged that these concerns about skewing the process have been raised. In the name of our collective future, it must change course.

The budget now heads to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk for his signature, which he must sign by June 30. He can line-item veto provisions in the budget. 
Anti-LGBTQ provisions 
A handful of anti-LGBTQ+ provisions are sprinkled throughout the budget, including a provision that would only recognize two sexes — male and female.

“Do we really have to make a law that says that men are men and women are women?” state Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, asked. “Do we really have to define that? We shouldn’t have to, but apparently we do.”
The budget would require public libraries to put books related to sexual orientation or gender identity in an area of the library that is out of sight for minors. 
“If moms and dads want their kids to be indoctrinated within that, that’s up to the moms and dads, but we’re not going to put it in children’s faces in the children’s sections of the libraries,” Click said. 
Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, called out the library provision. 
“If you are one of the 20% of young people who identify as LGBTQ, you’re not going to be a hero in that story,” he said. “We have to have more books that show you as a leader, as a champion, as a hero.”
The budget would also ban Pride flags from being flown at public buildings and prohibit giving funds to youth homeless shelters that house transgender youth, even if they also serve youth who are not transgender. 
“We are not hanging out the welcome mat for people from the LGBTQ community,” said Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood. “We should be a place where folks can just be who they are authentically and live and let live.”
Higher education provisions 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship awards the top 5% of each high school graduating class a $5,000 scholarship each year to attend an Ohio college or university. 
Under the final version of the budget, scholarship recipients must sign a statement of commitment to live in Ohio for three years immediately after graduation starting in fiscal year 2027. 
“If we want our young people to stay in Ohio, to start their careers in Ohio, to start a family in Ohio, we need to put our money where our mouth is, and we are doing that in this budget,” said Ohio House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville. 
The Senate’s version of the budget would have required scholarship recipients sign a promissory note, but the final version of the budget instead requires students to sign a statement of commitment to live in Ohio for the first three years after graduating college. 
“It was deemed (the promissory note) was a little bit heavy-handed and so we tried to roll that back,” Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon said. 
The budget allocates $47 million for fiscal year 2026 and $70 million in fiscal year 2027 for the Governor’s Merit Scholarship. 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was enacted through the last state budget two years ago and 76% of the state’s 6,250 eligible students from the class of 2024 accepted the scholarship. Eighty-seven percent of Ohio students accepted the scholarship in its second year and 11 rural counties had a 100% acceptance rate. 
The budget ties a portion of the State Share of Instruction to compliance with Senate Bill 1, a new higher education law banning diversity efforts, creates post-tenure reviews and an American civic literacy course, among other things. 
The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges and each university must submit a report showing compliance to the House and Senate higher education committees by March 1, according to the budget. 
Housing provisions 
The budget kept housing provisions the Senate added to the budget — $90 for the Residential Development Revolving Loan Program and $10 million for the Residential Economic Development District. 
The Residential Development Revolving Loan Program supports new, single-family residential homes in rural areas of the state. 
“If we want to grow our population, we have to have places for folks to live,” Stewart said. “This is going to be directed to small counties. We can’t be growing housing just in the three C’s, we need to be growing housing all across Ohio.”

After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
Uber, Lyft oppose some bills that aim to prevent assaults during rides

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.










We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
Thousands are suing states over sexual abuse in juvenile detention facilities

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sexual assault survivors can now track their rape kits in most states

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Taylor, in which a group of Montgomery County parents are suing for the right to take their children out of classes that have LGBTQ-themed books. (Photo by Nathan O’Neal/Cronkite News)The Supreme Court case Mahmoud v. Taylor has already been cast in stark moral terms: On one side, a public school district trying to foster inclusion and tolerance; on the other, a group of religious parents resisting progress.
But this case is not about banning books or rejecting diversity. It is about whether parents have a limited right to excuse their young children from specific public school lessons that conflict with their religious beliefs. That’s a First Amendment question — not a culture war skirmish — and it deserves to be treated as such.
The families challenging Montgomery County schools are Muslim, Christian and Jewish. Their children attend elementary school, where a handful of picture books featuring same-sex couples and discussions of gender identity are used in literacy lessons. The parents are not asking that these books be removed. They are asking for notice and the opportunity to opt out of particular lessons, so they can address those topics at home, in accordance with their faith.
The district initially allowed such accommodations. Then it reversed course. No more opt-outs, not even for kindergartners.
The district says its curriculum reflects its commitment to inclusivity, and that letting  families withdraw from certain lessons could undermine that goal. But the parents are not asking the state to affirm their beliefs — only to give them space to raise their children without contradiction from mandatory school messaging.

We’ve seen versions of this question before. In West Virginia v. Barnette (1943), the Supreme Court ruled that public schools could not force students to salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance. In Abington v. Schempp (1963), the court barred mandatory Bible readings in public classrooms. Though the content in those cases differed, the principle was the same: Public schools may not compel students to participate in messages that contradict their convictions.
The message in Mahmoud is not patriotic or religious, but it still carries moral weight. The lessons are designed to promote inclusion and affirm diverse identities and family structures. The question is whether families may decline to participate when those lessons conflict with their religious beliefs.
The district allows opt-outs in other contexts — for example, when students object to religious songs in choir or to depictions of the Prophet Muhammad in literature. But it has drawn a hard line at objections from religious families responding to LGBTQ-themed books. As Justice Gorsuch noted, when the government allows some exceptions and not others, it raises concerns about religious discrimination.
In Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021), the court held that when a policy allows officials to grant exemptions, it cannot deny a religious exemption unless it can meet the highest standard of constitutional scrutiny. That reaffirmed a core principle of the free exercise clause: When government creates space for individualized judgment, it must treat religious claims with the same respect it gives to others.
Understandably, some worry about a slippery slope. If parents can opt out of LGBTQ-inclusive material, what about civil rights history, feminism, or even basic science? That concern is real, but not new. Courts have long been able to distinguish between good-faith conscience-based requests and efforts to undermine public education.
The deeper problem is that we increasingly treat constitutional questions like Mahmoud as moral referenda. Once a case is framed as progress versus prejudice, there’s no room left for pluralism. Disagreement is interpreted as hostility. Rights become conditional on political alignment.
Yet the genius of the First Amendment is that it protects conscience across lines of ideology. If secular parents have the right to object to religious instruction in schools then religious parents should have the right to seek limited accommodation from secular messaging that conflicts with their faith.
You do not need to agree with the parents’ theology to understand why their rights matter. If public education is to serve a pluralistic society, it must allow space for real moral diversity. That includes LGBTQ students and families, and it also includes those whose beliefs about family and identity are shaped by longstanding religious traditions.
The court’s decision in Mahmoud could help reestablish that balance. But for the conversation to move forward, we must first abandon the assumption that all dissent is an attack. Sometimes it is simply an act of conscience. And in a constitutional democracy, we are supposed to protect that — even, and especially, when we disagree with it.  Stories default to familiar caricatures, offering little to promote a nuanced understanding of the complexity of the case. Mahmoud provides an opportunity to tell a new and better story — of a society in which deeply held differences can coexist.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/scotusfacade-1024.jpg,,,2025-06-26 03:00:36.086112

Ford,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/06/26/house-judiciary-committee-grapples-with-response-to-medical-examiner-audit/,House lawmakers grappled Wednesday to find a path forward on a report that dozens of police-custody deaths previously ruled accidental or of unknown causes by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner have been reclassified as homicides.,"Maryland’s former Chief Medical Examiner Dr. David Fowler testified as a defense witness during the murder trial of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd. (Screenshot from Court TV)House lawmakers grappled Wednesday to find a path forward on a report that dozens of police-custody deaths previously ruled accidental or of unknown causes by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner have been reclassified as homicides.
The report, the result of a four-year review of 1,300 cases between 2003 and 2019, was presented to the House Judiciary Committee by Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) and Towson University psychology professor Jeff Kukucka, who led the audit.
It revealed the potential of racial and pro-police biases in the office led by former Medical Examiner David Fowler that led to the incorrect characterization of some deaths as accidental. The report, originally released last month, included several recommendations, most of which are administrative, Brown said.
“None of the recommendations require legislation,” Brown said. But, “they all could be done by legislation. If you’re going that path, we respectfully ask that we’d be involved to help shape that.”
Judiciary Committee Chair Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) said the committee would likely meet again to discuss the issues, if not before the start of the 2026 General Assembly session, then shortly thereafter.
The hearing was the latest in the sudden unraveling of the legacy of the office under Fowler, who led it form 2003 to 2019, when he resigned.
Questions arouse after Fowler was called as an expert witness in the trial of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, a white police officer who was ultimately convicted of murder in the May 2020 death of George Floyd, a Black man, while in police custody. As part of Floyd’s arrest, Chauvin knelt for up to nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, who said repeatedly that he could not breathe.
Medical examiner audit reclassifies dozens of police-restraint deaths as homicides

Local autopsies determined that Floyd’s death — captured by witnesses on cellphone video that went viral — was a homicide.But Fowler testified that he would have ruled Floyd’s death caused by “excited delirium” rather than police actions.
Excited delirium was a catchall term used to describe aggressive behaviors related to mental health or substance abuse issues. It has been disavowed by the American Medical Association and the National Association of Medical Examiners, and Kukucka said Wednesday that it has since been abandoned by Maryland’s medical examiner’s office.
Fowler’s testimony triggered outrage, and a 2021 letter signed by 450 medical experts called on Maryland officials to reexamine deaths in police custody and medical examiner’s office practices under Fowler.
That audit involved independent review of Maryland cases by a dozen forensic pathologists around the globe, who determined that 48  police-custody deaths during Fowler’s tenure should be reclassified as homicides. The audit said 32 of the 48 cases reclassified as homicides involved victims who were Black, the other 16 were white.
The reviewers determined that the office was more likely to determine a death was homicide if the victim was white, at 44%, but only 16% if the person who died was Black.
“As AG Brown mentioned, it’s a pattern that is consistent with the possibility of racial bias,” Kukucka said. “That homicides are being under-counted in general, but they’re being under-counted even more dramatically if the decedent is Black.”
Kukucka also said the medical examiner’s office certified 14% of restraint deaths as homicides when police were involved, but that nearly quadrupled, to 54%, if the restraint was applied by a security guard, emergency medical personnel, or some other individual who was not a police officer.
Kukucka and Brown reiterated the findings do not imply criminal wrongdoing or liability. But an executive order issued by Gov. Wes Moore (D) directed the attorney general’s office to work with local state’s attorneys to review each case.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We will determine whether reinvestigation is warranted in these matters,” Brown said. He later said if a case would need to be reopened, that’s “if, and only a big capital, bold if, there was evidence that suggested prosecution.”
Baltimore County State’s Attorney Scott Shellenberger (D) said in a brief interview Wednesday afternoon any cases referred to his office will be reviewed that “might change the status of a case.”
“It’s going to take a bit [of time] because we’ve got to put together the files again,” Shellenberger said. “We’ll have to really do some digging.”
Legislation not needed, but…
During the virtual committee hearing, Del. Robin Grammer Jr. (R-Baltimore County) asked the researchers defined homicide.
Kukucka used an example of a hunter who shoots at game, but misses the animal and accidentally shoots and kills another hunter. From a death investigation standpoint, he said “that death is a homicide.”
“So how does the office of the chief medical examiner differentiate between an accident and a homicide?” Grammer asked. “Where’s the actual different difference here? Because it could be accidental when a person dies, and now you’re subject to felony murder, or if it’s negligence, maybe manslaughter.”
Del. N. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County) asked Brown if any of the audit’s recommendations should be codified into legislation.
Some of the recommendations included requiring better quality autopsy photos from the medical examiner’s office (some were black-and-whites); sending mental health experts on some emergency responses; and reviewing audit cases the pathologists determined a cause of death to be a homicide.
Brown said the recommendations can be handled administratively such as through the medical examiner’s office or the state Department of Health.
Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the committee, asked about a recommendation to conduct a follow-up audit in another five years. Bartlett asked why not sooner, especially with the biases noted in the audit.
Kukucka said five years provides more time to collect data to conduct a comprehensive audit.
“After two or three years, there may simply not be enough cases to draw firm conclusions,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-14-132-1-1024x640.png,,,2025-06-26 01:59:10.512272

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
‘Are nursing homes our only option?’ These centers offer older adults an alternative.

Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

I was one of more than 1,100 volunteers from all 50 states who gathered at the 2025 Alzheimer’s Impact Movement (AIM) Advocacy Forum. Hosted by the Alzheimer’s Association’s advocacy arm, the forum is an annual three-day event that brings together people like me – people with personal stories, loved ones lost, and a deep drive to make change.

Erin Mahoney in Washington, D.C. 
This year, our Connecticut delegation included ten passionate advocates from across the state. On the final day of the forum, we went to Capitol Hill and met with our Connecticut members of Congress to share our experiences and ask for their support.
I advocate in memory of my mother, who died of younger-onset Alzheimer’s in 2018 at just 65 years old. She was vibrant, funny, and brilliant — the kind of person who lit up a room. But Alzheimer’s slowly stole her from us, piece by piece. I watched my mother, once fiercely independent, lose her words, her ability to care for herself and eventually, her life. The grief of that loss never fully fades. But I’ve learned to channel it into purpose.
Each year, I return to D.C. not just for her – but for the millions of Americans living with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, and the caregivers who carry so much of the burden, often in silence. In Connecticut alone, over 80,000 people are living with Alzheimer’s, and more than 100,000 unpaid caregivers provide support to loved ones. This is a public health crisis hiding in plain sight.
At the forum, we asked our members of Congress to support increased research funding through the National Institutes of Health, continued funding for the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act, protections for Medicaid coverage, and access to affordable and timely diagnostic tools — including coverage for biomarker testing. We also advocated for better education and training for primary care providers, who are often the first point of contact for families facing a dementia diagnosis.
This is emotional work and not always easy. I’ve spent years sharing my story, following up with offices, and posting about advocacy on social media. I keep going because I know the silence around this disease is part of what allows it to persist.
If I’ve learned anything, it’s that the most powerful change doesn’t always start in headlines or press conferences. It starts in living rooms and support groups, in the quiet hands of caregivers, and in stories shared on Capitol Hill. Advocacy is often invisible labor – but that doesn’t make it less important.
I hope Connecticut’s lawmakers continue to lead the way in this fight. Alzheimer’s doesn’t care who you are, where you live, or what party you belong to. It steals futures and fractures families – and the time to act is now.
Until there’s a cure, we need compassion. We need resources. And we need to keep showing up.

It is incumbent upon us as food justice advocates and caring citizens to express our concern regarding billions of dollars in proposed cuts and administrative changes to nutrition assistance programs, most critically, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
We denounce actions taken to ﬁnd savings for the budget reconciliation bill from reforms to SNAP, such as stronger work requirements and cost-sharing with states. Cutting into nutrition assistance programs further compromises democratic principles already in peril.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other food security measures, including the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), emerged in the 1940s after World War II with a complex set of objectives. These programs initially served, in part, to manage overproduced commodities through charity-based food and nutrition security systems, but did so within a framework that has inadvertently contributed to the growth of ‘Big Ag’ and ‘Big Food.’ 
Despite their complex intent, these programs address critical issues like hunger and malnutrition, stimulate economic development, help prevent social unrest, and contribute to a more peaceful society. Serving mostly children and seniors, SNAP and NSLP stand as the country’s largest and second-largest food security safety-nets. 
As a nation bound by our shared responsibility for one another’s welfare, we must protect these programs from any endangerment and recognize their role in preserving peace, nourishing our most vulnerable populations, and strengthening our democracy.
Connecticut faces a deepening food insecurity crisis. The 2025 Map the Meal Gap report reveals that one in seven Connecticut residents, or 14.3% of the state’s population, are food insecure. This translates to over 516,000 people struggling with hunger, a concerning increase of more than 10% from the previous year. Jason Jakubowski, President and CEO of Connecticut Foodshare, underscores the severity of the situation, stating, “The new Map the Meal Gap report conﬁrms that food insecurity is getting worse in Connecticut and it’s getting harder to address.”
In 2024, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provided a crucial safety net for nearly 400,000 Connecticut residents, representing one in nine state residents. A total of $885 million in SNAP beneﬁts were disbursed that year. However, it is important to recognize that many recipients received limited assistance, with some seniors’ monthly beneﬁts amounting to as little as $60.
SNAP serves as a powerful economic driver. Every dollar invested in SNAP generates up to $1.80 in economic activity. Furthermore, SNAP oﬀers vital market support to farmers and small businesses while promoting the physical and mental well-being of seniors and individuals with disabilities.
However, SNAP does more than just help with food; it’s a gateway to other essential services. When families lose their SNAP beneﬁts, their children also lose automatic qualiﬁcation for free school meals. Meg Zimmerman, Program Manager at End Hunger CT!, emphasizes this crucial connection: “SNAP is not only the most eﬀective anti-hunger program in the country, but it’s also a key pathway to other anti-hunger programs, such as free school meals.” She explains that schools use data-matching to identify students who receive SNAP and automatically enroll them in free school meal programs. This automatic certiﬁcation is highly eﬃcient, saving administrative time and money. However, if families are cut oﬀ from SNAP, fewer children will be directly certiﬁed for school meals, meaning eligible kids could slip through the cracks and go without access to proper nutrition.
We ask that our U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal  embrace a new vision, alongside food and farm assistance programs, that are led by communities empowered by their own food, land and watershed sovereignty.
Connecticut is fortunate to have a diverse coalition, predominantly Black and Brown farmers, growers, food entrepreneurs and policy advocates who are leading a movement towards an equitable, just, resilient and regionalized food system rooted in interdependent relationships.
The charitable food system is stretched thin. Food banks and pantries cannot shoulder the responsibility of unprecedented levels of food insecurity, especially as diminishing federal food and farm assistance programs compound an already fraught system. We all must employ our imaginations and pave pathways towards a food culture where access to food, land and watersheds is upheld as a human right.
We invite you to join us as a food system changemaker and uplift the following programs – although by no means an exclusive list:


Federal Policy/Programs such as: Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement (LFPA) Local Food For School Cooperative Agreement Program (LFSA) and the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) and the Land Capital Market Access Program (LCMAP)
State Policy/Programs such as: School Meals For All CT, Local Food For Local Schools Incentive Program, CT Grown For CT Kids Grant and Food Recovery Initiatives
Community-Based Organizations such as: Liberated Land Cooperative, Sovereign Land Trust, Fairgate Community Farm, Green Village Initiative, Brass City Harvest, Northwest CT Food Hub, CT Farm To School Collaborative and New Connecticut Farmer Alliance

We must underscore the profound value and potential that lies in the synergy between federal and state policy programs and community-based organizations. This interconnectedness is critical for eliminating not only food insecurity, but the diverse social, economic, and ecological issues that are direct consequences of the industrial food system’s detrimental impacts. 
We ask that Murphy and Blumenthal use their position of inﬂuence, and power, to support these programs and to integrate them into their narrative around a larger vision for a democratic society. Transformation in the food system, informed and guided by said programs, will lead us towards the creative connections, authentic well being, thriving communities and stronger democracy we all long for.
We are grateful for their representation and sincerely thank them for their courage in defending our democracy at a time rife with challenges.

Jared Polis speaks at the Colorado Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A Denver judge on Wednesday blocked the Colorado governor’s office from forcing a state employee to hand over records to federal immigration authorities on 35 sponsors of unaccompanied immigrant children in the state.
The information was sought in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoena from April.
The preliminary injunction, handed down by Denver District Court Judge A. Bruce Jones, applies only to Scott Moss and staffers in the Division of Labor Standards and Statistics within the state’s labor department. Moss is the division’s director.
“I will not enjoin the governor from otherwise responding to this subpoena if that’s what he wants to do,” Jones said. “And it’s not to say that there isn’t some other workaround where somebody could ask one of his supervisees to do something and they do it. I’m not enjoining them from doing it. I’m enjoining the governor from requiring that they do it.”

The ICE subpoena seeks personal information, such as addresses, telephone numbers, emails and employment history, on 35 sponsors of immigrant children, purportedly in order to check on the children’s welfare and investigate any potential child abuse. Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, decided to comply with the subpoena in late May after some deliberation.
That’s when Moss filed a lawsuit against Polis alleging that disclosing the data would violate a state law against data sharing with ICE unless it is for a criminal investigation or under a judge-signed subpoena. Moss’ lawyers argued in court this week that the subpoena does not fit that standard because it does not point to any specific, ongoing criminal investigation and could be an attempt from federal immigration authorities to find the names and addresses of people to put in deportation proceedings.
“It’s essentially a fishing expedition,” Moss lawyer Laura Wolf said in court on Monday.
In his testimony, Moss said that during an April 29 meeting with representatives from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, the attorney general’s office and the governor’s office, “nobody expressed the view that the production should be made in light” of the state law.
“We all agreed that if there were concerns about child welfare, those should be looked into by appropriate folks. But we all agreed that we had not seen any evidence of any harm to children,” Moss said. “If we had any evidence, it could be routed the appropriate way. There are state and local agencies that cover such things.”
CDLE director Joe Barela then told Moss in late May that Polis had changed his mind and wanted to produce the records requested by the subpoena.
“He said that the governor didn’t want to be accused of not helping ICE prevent any harm that might be happening to any children,” Moss said Tuesday in court. “He said that the governor … thought that the criminal exception (in the law) … gave him ‘cover.’”
Polis’ lawyers argued this week that the subpoena related to criminal matters, and that Moss was not at risk professionally if he decided not to tell his employees to produce the information. That could have meant Barela, or some other official, would make the order.
“But the statute isn’t about protecting me personally. It’s about protecting the individuals named from having their (personal identifying information) released in a potentially injurious way. It wouldn’t make me feel any better if, to save me from the trouble, other state employees would have this thrust upon them,” Moss said Tuesday.
Colorado in recent years has enacted state laws, including legislation signed in 2021 and earlier this year, that limit the sharing of data about immigrants with federal immigration enforcement authorities.
Two unions that represent state employees, Colorado WINS and AFL-CIO, are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman said the governor’s office is reviewing next steps.
“We will abide by the court’s decision as we have always said we would,” she wrote in an email. “Governor Polis remains committed to fully and promptly cooperating with federal criminal investigations into child trafficking and exploitation, while protecting unaccompanied children in Colorado. We hope if information is needed for criminal investigations, that going forward (Homeland Security Investigations) will provide subpoenas for state information consistent with this ruling.”
Polis has repeatedly said that he welcomes federal help to detain and deport “dangerous criminals.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)I have only lived in Alaska for 24 years, but have a lifetime of Alaskan adventure under my belt. During my time here I have worked as a biologist, field archaeologist, lodge owner and wilderness guide. In my off time, I have explored thousands of miles by dog team training for and running the Iditarod and Yukon Quest among other races, floated hundreds of miles of wild rivers, and hiked hundreds of miles of tough terrain. I have filled my family’s freezer yearly from the abundant fish, wild game and berries this land has to offer … every single one of these activities have been done almost exclusively on our public lands. Public lands are more than lines on a map, as Alaskans, we are tied to the land for food, economic benefit and recreation. These public lands are our shared inheritance, our greatest privilege — and our most fragile asset. 
So when Congress tries to sell them out from under us, we pay attention.
Buried in the Senate Budget Reconciliation Bill, H.R.1, is a clause that originally would have mandated that the federal government make between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres for over 250 million acres of public lands available for sale. That includes drawing from at least 82 million acres in Alaska alone. You can view these lands on a chillingly detailed interactive ArcGIS map. While the Senate parliamentarian removed this provision, at least one senator is seeking to revive it.
Under the original plan, you may find some of your favorite places in Alaska illuminated like a for-sale sign in our front yards. I see sections of the Iditarod and Yukon Quest trail, ready to be blocked, I see my little private remote lodge property completely surrounded by lands to give away, I see the spots where my family gets its food, I see the spots where we take clients on dog mushing expeditions. Mainly, I see my Alaskan life being erased by senators with no clue what these lands mean to many. 
Supporters of this public lands sell-off frame it as a way to reduce the federal deficit, return lands to the people, and to create “affordable housing.”  But Alaskans are too smart to fall for that. These lands already belong to the people. Selling them is not “returning” them — it’s liquidating them. For private interests. Forever. The majority of these lands in Alaska are far from population centers and any housing that would be created would be far from affordable. New housing developments would need roads, infrastructure, and services which currently do not exist. Eligible lands close to population centers are already heavily used for recreational purposes and bring immense benefits to these communities.
What do we get in exchange? Practically nothing. According to the Wilderness Society, the estimated revenue from these sales is negligible compared to the $459 billion that outdoor recreation contributes annually to the U.S. economy. Alaska’s share of that pie is substantial. Our guiding businesses, lodges, outdoor gear shops, bush pilots, and even small-town gas stations and restaurants depend on the access and abundance that public lands provide.
The loss goes far beyond economics. Once these lands are privatized, access is likely to be shut off. No more family hikes to berry patches, no more hunting camp with the friends, no more snowmachine access across snow-covered valleys. Subsistence communities — especially Alaska Native villages already navigating land constraints — would bear the brunt of these closures. It’s a direct threat to food security and cultural traditions. 
Maps published by Field & Stream, Outside Magazine, and High Country News show just how widespread this threat is. From the Brooks Range to the Wrangells, from Interior trapping trails to Southeast’s Sitka Blacktail country, the lands on the chopping block are your lands. And the  proposal was not vague. The text of H.R.1,Section 20305, explicitly instructs the Department of the Interior to identify federal lands “suitable for disposal” — a designation often made with little regard for public recreational use, hunting and habitat value, or subsistence rights.
This is not the first time we’ve had to defend public lands from attack—and it won’t be the last. But the scale of this threat is historic. Alaska has more public land at stake than any other state and this isn’t stopped now, we risk losing access to the very places that define who we are.
This really is a nonpartisan issue. Every outdoor enthusiast in Alaska is a public land owner and should be paying attention.  Millions of acres of Alaskan opportunity are at risk of being able to be sold to the highest bidder. Alaskans will not trade 100-year access for a one-time payout. Our lands are not a budget line. They’re a birthright. They are what makes us Alaskan.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis-Pool/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Democratic leaders rallied Wednesday against the congressional budget and tax cut bill, fearing changes to the national food assistance program will blow holes in state budgets and leave Americans hungry.
Four Democratic governors and two U.S. senators slammed the proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which they referred to as “ugly” and a “big beautiful betrayal of a bill” during a press call.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota led the call. She and U.S. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, as well as Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Laura Kelly of Kansas and Matt Meyer of Delaware took turns lambasting the Republican legislation.
“I’m very concerned about not only the money that this is going to cost but also the chaos that it’s going to create for so many people who will just give up and end up going hungry,” Kelly said.
The Democrats told stories of seniors, children, veterans and families who they worry will suffer as a result of cuts.
“They’re going to have that pain in their stomachs and throughout their body when they’re trying to go to bed or when they’re waking up in the morning of not having enough to eat,” Beshear said.
The bill changes by the day. Recent modifications from the U.S. Senate would require states to contribute a combined $128 billion to the federal food assistance program, which historically has been fully funded by the federal government. States would be required to contribute more money, the higher their payment error rates. States currently contribute half of administrative costs, but another provision in the bill seeks to reduce the federal government’s share by $27 billion, or 25%, creating additional costs for states.
The changes to SNAP from the Senate are multifold, but many are driven by cost-cutting measures and restricting eligibility.
The current proposal would bolster work requirements for SNAP beneficiaries and restrict eligibility for people in the U.S. without permanent legal status. Both provisions are designed to save the government almost $100 billion by making benefits more difficult to access for low-income families. The proposal also could eliminate internet expenses from utility benefit calculations, reducing the amount of money beneficiaries receive each month. That change is expected to save the government $11 billion.
The Democrats criticized Republicans for touting the bill as cutting costs while it is projected to add $3 trillion to the country’s deficit in the next decade.
Two of the bill’s food-benefits provisions — the state contribution requirement and restricted eligibility for immigrants who aren’t lawful permanent residents of the U.S. — broke a Senate rule, according to the budget committee. Those provisions either need to be fixed or, if left in, will be subject to a 60-vote threshold.
“That has not deterred the Republican leadership from continuing to search for workarounds, and apparently have found one,” said Kelly.
Republicans recently adjusted the language of the state contribution provision, and the Senate parliamentarian took it under review
Klobuchar, who sits on the Senate rules and agriculture committees, anticipated word on whether the new language violates a Senate rule by Thursday. Regardless, she said, Democrats intend to oppose the bill.
Most of the bill’s funding is a result of shifting costs in the billions to states, she said.
The majority of states have balanced budget rules, Klobuchar said, “so they would be forced to choose: pay for food assistance or reduce law enforcement, reduce education or reduce health care.”
Klobuchar quoted a letter Democratic governors sent Tuesday to congressional leadership, explaining their qualms with states taking on SNAP costs.
“These cuts from Congress don’t just increase state costs,” the letter said, “they make it nearly impossible for states to effectively plan for these long-term budget impacts.”
Most states have already finalized budgets ahead of the June 30 end date of the 2025 fiscal year.
Klobuchar said 4 million Americans will lose SNAP benefits as a result of the bill, which includes 1 million seniors, 800,000 parents with school-age children and 1.4 million people who live in areas where finding a job is difficult.
SNAP beneficiaries receive about $6.20 per person per day. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to more than 42 million people across the country. Around 115,000 Delawareans, 186,000 Kansans, 700,000 Kentuckians, 1.1 million Massachusetts residents and 360,000 Minnesotans receive monthly SNAP benefits as of March, according to preliminary estimates from the USDA.
Healey, of Massachusetts, said that for every one meal that a food bank provides, SNAP provides nine.
States don’t have the resources to fill gaps left behind by the proposed cuts, she said.
Kelly estimated Kansas, in administrative costs alone, will have to find more than $15 million per year to operate SNAP, which she called a conservative estimate. She expected Kansans in need will lose their benefits, especially if bolstered work requirements pass. She said they sound “really good” in theory, but worried the requirements and reporting will create hurdles for people who are “legitimately qualified” for benefits.
“We’re going to see the same thing happen with SNAP that we saw with Medicaid in states that were forced to, or did, put in work requirements,” she said.
Beshear drew a connection between the bill’s SNAP provisions and similar cuts that would weaken funding to rural hospitals. Kentucky has the highest number in the nation of rural hospitals at risk, with 35 facing closure. Beshear said those hospitals are often major employers. If rural hospitals close as a result of the bill, he said, Kentuckians are more likely to fall on hard times and turn to assistance programs like SNAP for help. But the proposed cuts to SNAP will make that more difficult, he said. Beshear criticized the cuts through the lens of religion, reciting the biblical story of the loaves and fishes.
“In a country where we grow enough food so that no one has to go hungry,” he said, “no one should go hungry.”

(Photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey)The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will allow oil and gas workers to more intensely harass polar bears away from people and equipment near the Beaufort Sea. 
A new rule, scheduled to take effect Thursday, follows a series of lawsuits brought by environmental groups who claimed that the federal government failed to adequately justify prior rules that allowed lower levels of harassment. 
Under federal regulations, “level B harassment” takes place when someone annoys an animal enough to change its behavior, typically steering it away from an object or person. 
“Level A harassment” takes place when that annoyance has the potential to injure the animal. 
In 2024, the 9th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals said in an order that it doubted federal officials’ claims that there would be no class A harassment against polar bears and directed the Fish and Wildlife Service to reexamine its approach.
With that order in hand, the service rewrote its rules “to allow the … Level A harassment of polar bears that may result from industry activities.”
A spokesperson for the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, a trade group, said that organization was still analyzing the proposed new rules and didn’t have additional comment.
But the change drew opposition from environmentalists.
“Polar bears are the poster children for animals at risk from our rapidly heating climate and they need far more protection than this rule provides,” said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, by email. “It’s horrific that the Trump administration ignored the science to greenlight more harm to polar bears while also proposing to open up more oil drilling in their habitat. Polar bears were already being driven toward extinction, and Trump is hitting the gas pedal.”

At the event at the Theater Arts Center in Waukee, Sand started by asking how many people in the crowd were Republicans, independents, and people who voted against him in elections, asking the audience to clap. Many did.
He then led the crowd to sing “America the Beautiful” with him before launching into his reasons for running for governor and answering questions from the crowd.
Sand, the only Democrat to currently hold statewide elected office in Iowa as state auditor, said though he is running as a Democrat, he is not a fan of political parties. When he first registered to vote, he registered as an independent, Sand said, but later “picked my poison” by registering as a Democrat to vote in political primaries. However, he said, “we should be talking about the fact that it is poison, we should still be talking about the fact that no matter what your party is, partisanship in this state and in this country has gone too far.”

He said he wants to focus instead on policies and ways that government can work to better serve Iowans on the campaign trail.
“Let’s talk about issues,” Sand said. “Let’s talk about integrity. Let’s talk about ideas. Let’s learn what the facts are by talking to all the different stakeholders involved, and then figure out what a good thing to do is that we can actually implement, and then talk about that.”
While Sand is currently one of the highest-profile candidates in the 2026 race for governor and entered the race with more than $8 million from the 2024 calendar year, he is also running as a Democrat — a potentially tough sell following several election cycles where Republicans have won big across state and federal offices in Iowa.
Gov. Kim Reynolds’ decision to not run for reelection in 2026, combined with national discontent with President Donald Trump’s administration and Congress, could put Democrats, including Sand, in a better position for the upcoming election than previous years. However, Sand said he does not want to focus on advancing a Democratic agenda as governor, but on enacting policies that will improve Iowa.
He criticized Reynolds’ comments at several events that she is in friendly competitions with other GOP governors to pass tax cuts and certain policies.
“We have a governor right now who has talked about the fact that she thinks she’s in competition with other Republican governors to enact policies those Republican governors are in states that are nothing like Iowa, that can pursue policies that would not work in Iowa,” Sand said. “… I cannot understand that mindset. I can’t. I would work with anybody to do something good for the state of Iowa, but also (if) someone’s trying to do something bad or suggesting something that I don’t think would work here, I wouldn’t be interested in it. I have seen too much of policies getting imported from elsewhere that don’t work for Iowa.”
In addition to saying he would not be interested in following a party agenda, Sand said he supports certain policies opposed by many Democrats. When asked by a member of the audience about limiting unhealthy foods available for purchase through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Sand said he is generally supportive of a restriction. Democrats and hunger advocates often oppose SNAP restrictions, saying it is an unnecessary restriction for families in need seeking food.
“I think that one is a good idea,” Sand said. “People who criticize it as paternalistic, saying like, ‘Oh, well, you know, you shouldn’t decide what they’re going to buy with SNAP.’ Well, feeding people might be paternalistic too, and I feed my kids, and we don’t buy them pop. And I think that makes sense.”
But he said he does not support certain components of these proposals, pointing to Reynolds’ waiver excluding certain foods like candy and soft drinks from SNAP approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in May that would allow for candy to be purchased if it has flour in it. Sand asked “Gee, I wonder, was there someone that makes flour that had a role in crafting that legislation?” and said these measures need to pass the “smell test” if implemented.
Sand has also made other comments differing from typical Democratic positions, including answering “no” when asked on the WHO AM Simon Conway show in May if “biological boys or men should play women’s sports.”
Republicans have criticized Sand for portraying himself as moderate in his gubernatorial campaign. At an event earlier Wednesday, potential GOP gubernatorial candidate Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, called Sand a “wolf in sheep’s clothing.”
Though he said emphasized his moderate bonafides, Sand also said there are many measures passed by Republicans that he would oppose as governor. When asked about how he would work with Republicans at the Statehouse, who hold majorities in both chambers, Sand said Iowans could expect “more vetoes, probably.”
Sand said he would work across the aisle to advance measures he believe would help the state, but said that being a Democratic governor working with GOP-led chambers would mean some priorities are unlikely to pass.
“No one can honestly sit here and tell you, ‘I’m going to do this and I’m going to do that,’ because when we have divided government, it’s hard to get a lot of things done,” Sand said. “It also, though, means that for the folks out there who tend to be on the other side of the aisle, who are Republicans, having a Democratic governor doesn’t mean that I get to do everything I want, either. It means that we’re just going to have balance in the state of Iowa.”

We want young children, especially those living in poverty, to receive quality early childhood services from birth to Grade 3. We want families to feel welcome at our schools. And for the last 11 years, we’ve achieved that in the Omaha area under an ambitious initiative: the Superintendents’ Early Childhood Plan.
So, in March, when a national early childhood expert spoke in Omaha about the importance of forging strong relationships between schools and families, several current and former superintendents found ourselves nodding in agreement and recognition.

The plan was developed by superintendents and school staff, alongside the Buffett Early Childhood Institute at the University of Nebraska, to ensure all children are ready to learn and excel. Eleven superintendents endorsed it unanimously in July 2014.
It is funded through the vision and leadership of the Learning Community and stands as an example of
collaboration that extends beyond school boundaries.
Our support remains steadfast to this day, as the plan serves more than 2,800 children at the more intensive School as Hub sites.
That number climbs to 15,000 students affected when you consider school administrators and staff who receive professional development, coaching and other services.
National perspective
At the March 27 Superintendents’ Plan gathering, we listened as speaker Edward Manuszak, the executive director of early childhood at Washtenaw Intermediate School District in Michigan and a former superintendent himself, talked about early childhood education’s return on investment and the path that Omaha-area school districts have blazed.

 Who is participating

	The Metropolitan Omaha Educational Consortium includes the following superintendents:

Jason Buckingham, Ralston Public Schools
Bary Habrock, Elkhorn Public Schools
Travis Lightle, Gretna Public Schools
Mike Lucas, Westside Community Schools
Aaron Plas, Bennington Public Schools
Melissa Poloncic, Douglas County West Community Schools
Matthew Ray, Omaha Public Schools
Andrew Rikli, Papillion La Vista Community Schools
Jeff Rippe, Bellevue Public Schools
Ryan Saunders, Springfield Platteview Community Schools
John Schwartz, Millard Public Schools.



Influenced by the Superintendents’ Plan, Manuszak encouraged school districts to adopt a similar model in Monroe County, Michigan. “You’re leading the nation with this work,” he said.
The event was attended by dozens of education partners, including superintendents, principals, school staff, community and nonprofit leaders, and members of the Learning Community Coordinating Council. Improving outcomes for children in our community requires a
communitywide response.
Under the plan, there are now 10 School as Hub schools providing comprehensive services to families in the Bellevue, Douglas County West, Millard, Omaha, Ralston, and Westside districts. Bennington, Elkhorn, Gretna, and Papillion-La Vista receive consulting to meet district-specific early childhood goals.
Local progress
Here’s what this looks like in practice:
Home visitors show new parents how to read and talk to their infants to spark brain development. Families can enroll their child in high-quality preschools. Teachers and principals receive training on the best early learning practices.

(Courtesy of Buffett Early Childhood Institute)
And we know one key fact—it is working. Principals at School as Hub schools report 100% of Kindergarten classrooms met growth goals for math and reading. These schools also found improvements in teacher-child interactions and instruction through 3rd Grade. Participating families note increased connection with school staff and reduced stress.
Schools are engaging families in new and meaningful ways:

In addition to home visits and family engagement, Omaha Public Schools is leveraging staff to build a community and child care network through training and a collective focus on early childhood success. That includes new community facilitators who connect North and South Omaha schools with community child care programs serving future Omaha students.


In Millard, where deeper parent and guardian engagement has been a priority, Sandoz Elementary celebrates students’ family history and stories at its school events.


At Westbrook Elementary in Westside, an after-school “park and play” program allows babies and toddlers to play together while parents pick up their school-age siblings.

This kind of work is slow and deliberate. Success does not happen overnight. But we are honored to participate in an innovative program helping children learn long before they enter our school doors.
These early years matter so much. Let’s continue to make the most of this crucial time so all children have the opportunity to succeed.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)After nearly 40 years in Alaska’s state Capitol, Sen. Lyman Hoffman is calling it quits. 
On Wednesday, the Bethel Democrat confirmed that he will not seek reelection in 2026 and will end a political career that has left him as the longest-serving state legislator in Alaska history.
“Forty years is enough,” Hoffman said on Wednesday.
“I’m going to go back and become a civilian, and I’m going to talk with Rep. Edgmon and encourage him to file for my seat,” Hoffman said, referring to Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham.
Hoffman was elected to the state House in 1986 and to the state Senate in 1994. That year, his closest opponent was Edgmon.
“He’s from the region. He’s been in politics for over 20 years. I think we would have more continuity in having a seasoned person to represent the Senate district,” Hoffman said of Edgmon.
By text message, Edgmon said he is “taking a serious look” at running for Senate.
“Senator Hoffman’s announcement today was not unexpected; however, it still comes as a bit of a gut punch because of what he has meant not just to rural Alaska but to the state as a whole,” Edgmon said. “His departure is going to be a huge loss to the Legislature.”
Hoffman confirmed that he doesn’t intend to run for governor or any other office.
“The family life — that’s the toughest part. Leaving home, leaving family, leaving friends for three to six months out of every year, it puts a big strain,” he said. “So a lot of kudos out to my wife Lillian for putting up with me to do what I love to do.”
In a 15-minute phone interview, Hoffman reflected on his career, saying that in addition to a law that requires the state to fund rural schools, his biggest achievements were those related to energy. He successfully created an endowment fund for the Power Cost Equalization program, which subsidizes rural power costs, and that endowment now is worth more than $1 billion.
Other successes also were related to energy.
“We passed legislation to set up a weatherization program, and we’ve weatherized over $600 million worth of homes,” he said.
If the trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline is built, 20% of gas-sale royalties will be reserved for rural energy development, thanks to Hoffman’s work.
“I think that overall, the work I’ve done on energy is probably the most important thing,” he said. 
Asked what has changed in the Capitol during his 40 years, he said the power of rural legislators is now taken for granted. Earlier in his career, it wasn’t.
For the past 10 years, rural legislators have played a kingmaking role in the closely divided state House and Senate, frequently determining whether a Republican-led coalition or a Democratic-led coalition controls each body.
“There were times when rural Alaska wasn’t at the table, and I think that’s the biggest change,” Hoffman said.
“Even if you talk to urban legislators, I think the caliber of and the participation of rural legislators is well respected today,” he said.
When asked what advice he would give a new legislator, he said that it’s important to know that “the relationships you make directly affect your influence,” so it’s important to make friends.
“The top people that are out there — Senator (Gary) Stevens, Senator (Bert) Stedman, Senator (Donny) Olson. All of us have over 20 years of experience in the Senate, and we are good friends, and so I think it’s all about relationships and keeping your word to each other.”
During his time in office, the state’s population has grown, as has the influence of Alaska Native corporations, including Native health corporations.
“I’m chairman of the Bethel Native Corporation, and have been for around 30 years. Our wealth has multiplied by 20-fold. You know, I think that in the state … Native corporations have changed the state of Alaska for the better,” he said.
As he prepares to leave office, Hoffman said he thinks the state’s biggest unresolved issue is the affordability of living in Alaska, particularly with regard to the cost of energy.
“That’s why I spent so much time on it,” he said of energy issues.
“The unfinished business, I think the biggest one that is going to have a major impact on energy, is the gas line,” he said.
The high cost of energy in rural Alaska is also why he’s been interested in micronuclear reactors.
“Right now, people in rural Alaska are spending up to 50-60% of their disposable income on energy, and if they had that 50-60% reduced down to 10%, that would be a windfall to them, and that would change the way people look at Alaska, because it’s in many instances, it’s pretty expensive to live here because of energy,” he said.
“If we can crack the energy equation in the next two decades, I think that’s going to change the face of Alaska.”

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)A state-mandated racial equity study in Colorado has raised a total of more than $1 million and is a month ahead of schedule, according to a presentation Wednesday at the Colorado Capitol by the study’s leaders to the Black Coloradan Racial Equity Study Commission.
The commission oversees the ongoing History Colorado study, which is looking into inequalities, both historic and current, caused by racism in Colorado. 
The commission was established in June 2024 through Senate Bill 24-53. The law did not come with any state budget allocation, and the study instead derives its funding through grants, foundations and donations. The three-year study began work in the fall and will cost a total of $1.8 million. Fundraising efforts continue in an effort to bring in the remaining $740,000 needed.
“It’s a big deal to know that we’re doing something that’s simultaneously data-driven and community-funded,” said Colorado Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat who chairs the commission. “It’s powerful.”

The study focuses on the harms of racism in areas including housing, banking, employment, education, health care and criminal justice. The commission will make legislative recommendations based on the study’s findings.
The study examines the long-term economic inequalities that have stemmed from now-unlawful racist practices like hiring discrimination and redlining, which refers to race-based discrimination in real estate markets. Redlining was particularly prevalent in Colorado during the 1930s. 
Study leaders are also working to document the damages of racist violence throughout Colorado history, including at least seven lynchings of Black Coloradans in the late 1800s and bombings targeting Black Denver residents in the 1920s.
“We’re moving (through the study) with a sense of commitment, a sense of fervor and a sense of care,” History Colorado Program Manager Chloé Duplessis said. “As we all know, for far too long, there has been an absence of care when it comes to Black and Brown bodies, livelihoods and access to quality of life.”
Study leaders have uncovered that several lawmakers throughout Colorado’s early history either owned slaves or came from slave-owning families, including three U.S. senators.
Study leaders announced that they are scheduling several listening sessions to be held in Pueblo, Colorado Springs and Denver on Saturdays throughout September and October. These sessions will be open to the public, with a focus on hearing the stories of Coloradans, answering their questions and engaging them in the study’s research process. 
“Everything about this journey is not just for research purposes, but to honor and build capacity within the community,” Duplessis said.

Task force co-chair and Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, encouraged members during a meeting Wednesday at the University of South Dakota’s Sioux Falls campus to look at all options to cut budgets, reallocate funding, or raise or implement other taxes in order to achieve the group’s goal.
“If we’re going to actually go through this exercise of looking for property tax relief, then we have to turn over each rock, all of these rocks,” Karr said. “Even if I don’t believe I’m going to find what I’m looking for, I feel like there’s an obligation to look underneath and see what’s there.”

Lawmakers adopted Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s proposal earlier this year to slow property tax increases with multifaceted reforms including a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments. That new law will take effect next week. Rhoden has also proposed an optional county-level sales tax of a half-percent to offset participating counties’ property taxes on owner-occupied homes. 
Another idea pitched by Sen. Jim Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, on Wednesday would separate school funding from property taxes and create a new state sales tax of 1% dedicated to education funding. The 1% tax would apply to most products and services that are currently exempted from sales taxes, and would stack on top of the existing state sales tax rate of 4.2% for other transactions.
Lawmakers plan to discuss both ideas and others that might arise throughout the summer as they consider introducing legislation next winter to ease the tax burden for homeowners. The task force was created during this year’s legislative session. 
According to a presentation from the Legislative Research Council, the amount paid in property taxes by South Dakota homeowners increased 38.8% between 2020 and 2024. Owner-occupied properties accounted for 44.3% of total property taxes paid in the state in 2024.
Local government officials and representatives warned the group repeatedly Wednesday against knee-jerk reactions to recent increases and asked for consideration of the consequences of limiting revenue for local governments. Some members of the public encouraged lawmakers to make cuts or eliminate property taxes altogether.

Counties: Reduce unfunded mandates or open another revenue source
Counties and schools depend on property taxes for much of their revenue, while cities receive some property tax revenue but are more dependent on sales taxes. The state also depends on sales taxes and does not receive any revenue from property taxes.
County representatives told committee members that their budgets are already bare-bones.

Minnehaha County Auditor Leah Anderson said her county is losing money to complete some state-mandated services, such as mailing new license plates. Clay County Commissioner Geoffrey Gray-Lobe said his southeastern county cut its budget to essential services due to funding issues and decisions, despite high property taxes.
Any reductions in revenue would lead to cuts to infrastructure, road maintenance or public safety, county representatives warned, while saying about 80% of county budgets are spent on unfunded mandates imposed by the state.
Part of that cost includes public defenders and state’s attorneys required to be provided and funded at the county level, said Dan Klimisch, a Yankton County commissioner and president of the South Dakota Association of County Commissioners.
“Reduce or eliminate unfunded mandates,” Klimisch said, “or give us another revenue source.”
Cities, schools warn of budget cuts
Mike Jaspers, Sioux Metro Growth Alliance board chair, said lower property tax revenues could hurt communities because they wouldn’t be able to build infrastructure to support eventual growth and have a “balanced community.”
“Down the road, my biggest fear is forcing the hand of communities of what they will look like versus what they’d like to look like,” Jaspers said.

Sioux Falls Director of Finance Shawn Pritchett said the city experienced a 59% increase in expenses due to an increase in population and inflation over the past decade. The budget increased by 58% in that same timeframe.
“At its core, maintaining property taxes isn’t just about growing government,” Pritchett said. “It’s about trying to keep pace with our growing community.”
Amanda Mack, Harrisburg city administrator, listed millions of dollars of costs to build roads and  a new fire station to accommodate the city’s growth. South Dakota’s impending property tax changes, including a cap on the amount of growth that can be factored into property tax increases, will force the city to take on more debt, she said.
“These needs will not go away nor can they be ignored,” Mack said.
Jamie Nold, incoming superintendent for Sioux Falls School District, said the state’s largest district eliminated $3 million from this year’s budget, will do the same next year, and will reduce the budget by $1.5 million the year after to make up for less-than-desired state funding increases.
“People want to come here for the amenities that they have, not for the things they don’t have,” Nold said.
Some local governments seek to opt out of property tax limitations
According to the Legislative Research Council presentation, 69 taxing districts exercised their right to opt out of property tax limitations in fiscal year 2025, in order to raise more revenue. About 94% of those were approved without a public vote.
Most of the opt-outs happened in school districts, accounting for about $10 million in new opt-outs in fiscal year 2025. Less than $4 million in opt-outs were initiated by counties.
The number of active opt-outs among schools decreased from 66 in 2020 to 62 in 2024, though the total funding from opt-outs increased from $31.1 million to $34.1 million. The highest active opt-out is in Sioux Falls, at $11 million annually.
“As we look at opt-outs, we need to understand why they exist and how local governments have had to make that determination,” said Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish. “We can’t lump them all together.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/591A0214e-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-06-25 20:59:25.811264

TOPEKA — Democratic leaders rallied Wednesday against the congressional budget and tax cut bill, fearing changes to the national food assistance program will blow holes in state budgets and leave Americans hungry.
Four Democratic governors and two U.S. senators slammed the proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which they referred to as “ugly” and a “big beautiful betrayal of a bill” during a press call.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota led the call. She and U.S. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, as well as Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Laura Kelly of Kansas and Matt Meyer of Delaware took turns lambasting the Republican legislation.
“I’m very concerned about not only the money that this is going to cost but also the chaos that it’s going to create for so many people who will just give up and end up going hungry,” Kelly said.
The Democrats told stories of seniors, children, veterans and families who they worry will suffer as a result of cuts.
“They’re going to have that pain in their stomachs and throughout their body when they’re trying to go to bed or when they’re waking up in the morning of not having enough to eat,” Beshear said.
The bill changes by the day. Recent modifications from the U.S. Senate would require states to contribute a combined $128 billion to the federal food assistance program, which historically has been fully funded by the federal government. States would be required to contribute more money, the higher their payment error rates. States currently contribute half of administrative costs, but another provision in the bill seeks to reduce the federal government’s share by $27 billion, or 25%, creating additional costs for states.
The changes to SNAP from the Senate are multifold, but many are driven by cost-cutting measures and restricting eligibility.
The current proposal would bolster work requirements for SNAP beneficiaries and restrict eligibility for people in the U.S. without permanent legal status. Both provisions are designed to save the government almost $100 billion by making benefits more difficult to access for low-income families. The proposal also could eliminate internet expenses from utility benefit calculations, reducing the amount of money beneficiaries receive each month. That change is expected to save the government $11 billion.
The Democrats criticized Republicans for touting the bill as cutting costs while it is projected to add $3 trillion to the country’s deficit in the next decade.
Two of the bill’s food-benefits provisions — the state contribution requirement and restricted eligibility for immigrants who aren’t lawful permanent residents of the U.S. — broke a Senate rule, according to the budget committee. Those provisions either need to be fixed or, if left in, will be subject to a 60-vote threshold.
“That has not deterred the Republican leadership from continuing to search for workarounds, and apparently have found one,” said Kelly.
Republicans recently adjusted the language of the state contribution provision, and the Senate parliamentarian took it under review
Klobuchar, who sits on the Senate rules and agriculture committees, anticipated word on whether the new language violates a Senate rule by Thursday. Regardless, she said, Democrats intend to oppose the bill.
Most of the bill’s funding is a result of shifting costs in the billions to states, she said.
The majority of states have balanced budget rules, Klobuchar said, “so they would be forced to choose: pay for food assistance or reduce law enforcement, reduce education or reduce health care.”
Klobuchar quoted a letter Democratic governors sent Tuesday to congressional leadership, explaining their qualms with states taking on SNAP costs.
“These cuts from Congress don’t just increase state costs,” the letter said, “they make it nearly impossible for states to effectively plan for these long-term budget impacts.”
Most states have already finalized budgets ahead of the June 30 end date of the 2025 fiscal year.
Klobuchar said 4 million Americans will lose SNAP benefits as a result of the bill, which includes 1 million seniors, 800,000 parents with school-age children and 1.4 million people who live in areas where finding a job is difficult.
SNAP beneficiaries receive about $6.20 per person per day. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to more than 42 million people across the country. Around 115,000 Delawareans, 186,000 Kansans, 700,000 Kentuckians, 1.1 million Massachusetts residents and 360,000 Minnesotans receive monthly SNAP benefits as of March, according to preliminary estimates from the USDA.
Healey, of Massachusetts, said that for every one meal that a food bank provides, SNAP provides nine.
States don’t have the resources to fill gaps left behind by the proposed cuts, she said.
Kelly estimated Kansas, in administrative costs alone, will have to find more than $15 million per year to operate SNAP, which she called a conservative estimate. She expected Kansans in need will lose their benefits, especially if bolstered work requirements pass. She said they sound “really good” in theory, but worried the requirements and reporting will create hurdles for people who are “legitimately qualified” for benefits.

“We’re going to see the same thing happen with SNAP that we saw with Medicaid in states that were forced to, or did, put in work requirements,” she said.
Beshear drew a connection between the bill’s SNAP provisions and similar cuts that would weaken funding to rural hospitals. Kentucky has the highest number in the nation of rural hospitals at risk, with 35 facing closure. Beshear said those hospitals are often major employers. If rural hospitals close as a result of the bill, he said, Kentuckians are more likely to fall on hard times and turn to assistance programs like SNAP for help. But the proposed cuts to SNAP will make that more difficult, he said. Beshear criticized the cuts through the lens of religion, reciting the biblical story of the loaves and fishes.
“In a country where we grow enough food so that no one has to go hungry,” he said, “no one should go hungry.”

Kennedy Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the committee and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will reexamine current recommendations around childhood vaccination schedules and Hepatitis B immunizations, members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices announced during a meeting in Atlanta Wednesday.
The committee, which meets three times a year, does not typically garner much public interest. However, this meeting is the first since U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the committee and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics, launching the little-known committee into the national spotlight.
Medical experts, including the American Medical Association, expressed dismay at Kennedy’s appointment of the new committee members, which the organization said occurred “without transparency and proper vetting to ensure they have the expertise necessary to make vaccine recommendations to protect the health of Americans.”

“We urge the Administration to reconsider the removal of the 17 ACIP members who have deep expertise in vaccines so physicians can continue to have confidence in ACIP’s recommendations,” AMA President Bobby M. Mukkamala said in a statement.
Six former ACIP chairs also authored an op-ed after the former committee members’ dismissal, warning that “if relevant scientific expertise on vaccines is not maintained, access to vaccines may fundamentally change.”
The move was also made in direct contradiction with a promise from Kennedy to Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy ahead of the secretary’s confirmation in February. Cassidy says Kennedy pledged to “maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes.” 
Cassidy, a doctor who cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as health secretary, called for the meeting to be delayed until members with more expertise in vaccines could be appointed to the panel, but was unsuccessful. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski also expressed concern about the backgrounds of the new panelists.
The committee is now chaired by Martin Kulldorff, a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who was fired in 2024 after declining the COVID-19 vaccine, and has spoken out against blanket vaccine mandates during the pandemic. 
“Secretary Kennedy has given this committee a clear mandate to use evidence-based medicine when making vaccine recommendations, and that is what we will do,” Kulldorff said in his opening remarks. He also disputed characterizations of his skepticism of vaccine mandates as “anti-vax.”
“Some media outlets have been very harsh on the new members of this committee, issuing false accusations and making concerted efforts to put scientists in either a pro- or anti-vaccine box,” he said. “Such labels undermine critical scientific inquiry, and it further feeds the flame of vaccine hesitancy. To thoroughly scrutinize and assure the safety and efficacy of vaccines is a pro-vaccine position.”
Other appointees to the committee include Robert Malone, a doctor and biochemist who said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise” and Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses who also serves on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, an organization that advocates for vaccine exemptions.
One member of the committee, Michael Ross, had already withdrawn from the committee by the time the body convened for the two-day summit in Atlanta. Kennedy, who was attending a “Make America Healthy Again” event in Oklahoma, was not present at the meeting. 
‘Completely unprecedented’
As the committee met inside, dozens of people braved the sweltering heat to hold what they called a “parade of preventable diseases” to highlight the dangers of limiting the public’s access to vaccines. They also called for the committee to be restored to its previous makeup.
A whole colorful cast of pathogens were represented just outside the center’s entrance, from influenza to HPV to meningococcus. Dr. Deblina Datta carried a leg brace to represent polio.
“This is what we don’t want to see again. When we introduce vaccine skepticism, we are going to see people wearing this,” Datta said holding up the brace.

Datta spent more than two decades at CDC working on immunizations, with six years with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. She called the abrupt overhaul of the committee alarming.
“While a healthy skepticism of vaccine policy is good, this level of skepticism and the sources of the skeptics being put onto ACIP is calamitous,” Datta said. “And it’s absolutely eroding the public’s faith in the ACIP to dictate policy.”
Katrina Kretsinger, who retired from the CDC two years ago after working mostly on vaccine-preventable diseases, said she has major concerns about the changes made to the committee.
“This is completely unprecedented,” she said. “And I really don’t think it’s going to have any credibility.”
But she said she is also trying to have “a little bit of wait and see” attitude about the new members.
“I would say that there’s a number of them who seem like they are reasonably well qualified, and then there are others of the seven who come with a very clear anti-vaccine agenda and are well known for viewpoints that are really hard to defend based on the scientific merits,” Kretsinger said. “It’s very disappointing.”
ACIP’s new agenda
The new ACIP appointees are scheduled to spend two days reviewing safety and efficacy data on COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella (MMRV), Influenza, Anthrax and Chikungunya vaccines before voting on new immunization recommendations.
However, Kulldorff said the committee also plans to commission new working groups dedicated to evaluating the impact of childhood vaccines and investigating the timeline for the recommended administration of Hepatitis B vaccines in newborns. The committee will also be reexamining vaccines that have not been reviewed within the last seven years.
“In addition to studying and evaluating individual vaccines, it’s important to evaluate the cumulative effect of the recommended vaccine schedule,” Kulldorff said.
Thursday’s agenda also includes a presentation from Lyn Redwood, the former head of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy. 
Redwood, who is not a CDC employee, is expected to argue that a preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines, known as thimerosal, causes autism. According to the CDC, research has shown no connection between thimerosal and autism or any other source of harm, and the chemical was taken out of childhood vaccines in the U.S. in 2001.

,DC,2025-06-26 00:08:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,GOP mega-bill stuck in US Senate as disputes grow over hospitals and more,"Ashley Murray, Shauneen Miranda, Jacob Fischler, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-mega-bill-stuck-us-senate-disputes-grow-over-hospitals-and-more,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans appeared deeply divided Wednesday over how to establish a fund for rural hospitals to offset the budget impacts of Medicaid cuts in the “big, beautiful bill.”The hospitals, which are generally already hurting financially, rely heavily on Medicaid, a state-federal partnership that provides health insurance for low-income households and for some people with disabilities.GOP senators haven’t yet reached agreement on how to structure the fund, or on dozens of other unresolved provisions in the sweeping package, even though leaders hope to begin voting as soon as Friday. Still up in the air were agreements on major provisions of the measure involving the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s food aid program for low-income people and a proposed selloff of certain public lands.Republican leaders continued to project optimism. “We’re well on our way to getting this bill passed this week,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a floor speech, continuing to press ahead toward a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline. Others saw it differently. Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson cast doubt on the short timeframe leaders have set to reach final agreement and move the bill through both chambers.""We're still discussing some pretty fundamental issues,” Johnson said. “I'm just laying out the reality of the situation. We've got a lot of work to do.”‘The only person up here that’s ever ran a rural hospital’Dueling plans to establish the rural hospital fund to ease the threat of Medicaid cuts circulated among senators working to finalize the massive tax and spending cut measure, but an agreement had not surfaced by late afternoon.Unofficial details showed Senate Republicans eyeing the inclusion of a $15 billion fund — $3 billion a year between fiscal 2027 and fiscal 2031 — to help rural hospitals, according to multiple reports.But Sen. Roger Marshall, who sits on the Senate Committee on Finance, said he wants to increase that fund to $5 billion annually, with “half of that going to rural hospitals, and half of it going to primary care and prescription drugs and throw in physical therapy and occupational therapy, all the others as well.”The Kansas Republican and physician said “we should probably only do it for four or five years and then regroup and see where we are.”“I'm the only person up here that’s ever ran a rural hospital — I actually know something about them,” he added.While Marshall said he loves “90%” of the broader bill, he said not nearly enough is being cut.“But I can't get the votes to do that, so it’d still be the largest cut in spending in my lifetime anyway,” he said, noting that “it’s going to be hard for the House to vote against it.”Fund size criticizedOn a midday call with reporters, Traci Gleason with the Missouri Budget Project said the stabilization fund being batted around by lawmakers “would fall well short of addressing these problems.”“Forty-three percent of Missouri's rural hospitals are at risk of closing, and 17% are considered to be at immediate risk,” said Gleason, who spoke during a virtual press briefing organized by the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.“Those figures don't account for all of the other health care providers in rural communities, like federally qualified health centers and others that operate on these incredibly thin margins. So the massive cuts to Medicaid are what is creating the problem and the only real way to address it is for Congress to not make these massive cuts,” she said.‘Problematic’ Medicaid cutsSen. Susan Collins was advocating for a much bigger rural hospital stabilization fund, at $100 billion.“I don't think that solves the entire problem,” the Maine Republican and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee said.“The Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that's problematic as well.”Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia said that the $15 billion “is better than zero.”“You know, naturally, I'd want it to be as high as it possibly can,” he said, adding that rural hospitals are the “lifeblood” of his state.Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a loud voice against Medicaid benefit cuts, said a stabilization fund is a “good idea but we're still going to have to address the longer term effects of this.”When asked for a dollar figure, Hawley said “it depends on the structure of it.”Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said he keeps hearing the Senate will take a procedural vote on Friday, though that isn’t set in stone. “Should be a fun weekend for all of us,” Cornyn said. “Can't wait.”Once the Senate votes on what is called a motion to proceed, there’s a maximum of 20 hours of floor debate before the chamber must begin its marathon amendment voting session and eventually a passage vote.SNAP provisionsSenate Agriculture Chairman John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, said a revised version of his committee’s bill had not yet been reviewed by the parliamentarian.The updated text alters a section restructuring the cost-share of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a key food assistance program for low-income people.The provision would require states for the first time to shoulder some of the cost of the program’s benefits. The amount a state owes would be determined by its error payment rate, with greater error rates requiring a higher state share.Complex rules govern what can and can’t be included in the measure. The Senate parliamentarian ruled the language in the initial proposal did not comply with the chamber’s reconciliation rules.The updated proposal would allow states more flexibility during the policy’s phase-in in fiscal 2028, allowing them to choose either the error rate in fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2026.Boozman told reporters that change sought to respond to the parliamentarian’s ruling.The parliamentarian “asked us to allow them (states) to use a different time frame — essentially gave them more time to understand what their error rate would be and to plan for it,” Boozman said. “And so we adjusted for that and I think we satisfied it.”Lee and public landsSenate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Mike Lee of Utah reportedly narrowed a provision that would mandate the sale of Bureau of Land Management lands. He has not publicly said where it stands with the parliamentarian.A committee spokesman did not return messages seeking clarification Tuesday and Wednesday, but a version of the changes obtained by news media shows changes consistent with what Lee proposed Monday.Those changes include limiting the mandated sales to only the BLM — and not U.S. Forest Service lands, as Lee had initially proposed — and lowering the percentage of the agency’s lands that must be sold to between .25% and .5%. The initial proposal required between .5% and .75%.The updated provision would also only require lands located within 5 miles of a population center to be sold and exempts lands that are currently used for grazing or another “valid existing right that is incompatible with the development of housing,” according to a copy of the changes obtained by hunting and angling publication Outdoor Life.The provision has sparked opposition from Western lawmakers, including a handful of conservatives.But it also has its share of supporters. Alaska Republican Dan Sullivan told reporters he had not seen the updated text but remained supportive of the idea.“I've been supportive of what Sen. Lee is trying to do,” he said. “We have a lot of public lands in Alaska that the federal government abuses. But we're in a good discussion on that, so I need to see the update.”",,,,2025-06-25 20:59:25.811264

A long-awaited scientific report commissioned by Polk County says farm pollution threatens the ability to drink clean water and to safely interact with central Iowa streams, Iowa Capital Dispatch has learned.
The county announced its Central Iowa Source Water Research Assessment in 2023 and heralded it as a first-of-its-kind, unbiased and comprehensive examination of the watersheds that feed the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers, which converge near downtown Des Moines.
The topic is acutely important: Central Iowa Water Works recently banned lawn watering — for the first time ever — to prevent nitrate concentrations in its treated drinking water from exceeding a federal health limit.

Further, there are plans to spend more than $120 million to make the area a major destination for water recreation. That includes installing a machine near the confluence of the rivers to generate waves suitable for surfing.
But sampling shows the rivers routinely have fecal bacteria concentrations that exceed safe limits for swimming.
The assessment’s final report — dubbed “Currents of Change” — was expected to be released earlier this year, but the county has thus far declined to make it public. The county has denied requests to release it under the state’s open records law on the basis that the report is still in draft form.
A county spokesperson has declined to comment about the situation.
Groups that are potentially affected by researchers’ findings have reviewed some or all of the report.
“This is not new information that we have a water quality issue in Iowa,” said Stephanie Oppel, executive director of Iowa Confluence Water Trails, which seeks to enhance water recreation in central Iowa with public funding.
Oppel said her organization — commonly known as ICON — does not dispute the underlying data that was collected for the project but disagrees with conclusions that central Iowa streams might be unhealthy for recreational activities. She said she didn’t know why the county has delayed the release of the report.
“All recreation is not without risk,” Oppel said. “There is some sort of risk.”
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, a powerful group that advocates for agriculture, did not respond to requests to comment for this article.
The report is more than 200 pages and is the result of about 4,000 hours of analysis and assessment by a team of researchers who were commissioned by the county, according to a copy of the report obtained by the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
Two people who examined that copy and have viewed the original report confirmed the copy is authentic.
The analysis is based on data and research that spans decades. It is the product of work by 16 researchers at a variety of institutions, including the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, Drake University, the U.S. Geological Survey and a federal lab in Illinois, the Argonne National Laboratory.
The report contains a detailed look at the characteristics of the region, the river contaminants and their sources, and their effects on water quality. The researchers also made about two dozen recommendations to help remedy the problems and for future research.
The analysis covered a wide variety of contaminants but focused on several tied to agriculture, including nitrate, phosphorus, fecal bacteria and toxins produced by microbes.
Nitrate problem is uniquely Iowan
Federal data show that the highest stream nitrate concentrations are “predominantly found in Iowa,” the report said.
And an analysis of intensively farmed areas in four other states showed that the high concentrations are an anomaly: “Successful agriculture can coexist with substantially lower river nitrate levels,” the report said.
Nitrate is limited by federal regulators for drinking water to prevent blue baby syndrome, a condition in which infants are deprived of oxygen. But research has tied elevated nitrate consumption to colorectal cancer, thyroid disease and other ailments in adults.
Central Iowa Water Works, the largest drinking water utility in the state that serves more than a half million people, implemented this month a first-ever lawn watering ban for the Des Moines metro. That has helped prevent the utility’s water from exceeding the federal nitrate limit.
The utility employs a robust nitrate-removal facility, but nitrate concentrations in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers — its primary water sources — have spiked in recent weeks along with summer water demand. The utility also blends the river water with other sources to reduce nitrate but was struggling to keep pace with demand.
River nitrate in Iowa has ballooned in the past two years, according to Iowa Water Quality Information System data. That follows a nearly four-year drought that ended last year and likely allowed nitrate concentrations to build in cropland soil.
The report Polk County commissioned concludes that nearly 80% of nitrate in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers is directly tied to agriculture.
Specifically, the nitrate sources are synthetic fertilizers, livestock manure and soybeans, which have a symbiotic relationship with microbes that produce nitrate.
The report said an additional, unspecified amount of nitrate contaminates the landscape when ammonia from manure goes into the atmosphere and disperses.
Nitrate is an important fertilizer for corn, but it can quickly leach into streams via surface runoff and through the vast expanses of underground tubing that drain saturated crop fields.
More than three-quarters of cropland in the upper Des Moines River watershed has the drainage tiling, the researchers found.
The state’s 12-year-old Nutrient Reduction Strategy has encouraged farmers to voluntarily reduce their stream pollution with a variety of conservation practices, often with the help of state funding. But the researchers said such efforts need to be “outcome based,” meaning those practices should be monitored to determine their effectiveness at reducing the pollution.
An example is sampling water going into and out of wetlands that are designed to reduce pollution to measure nitrate reductions.
Further, the researchers said state regulators need to improve their oversight of livestock manure disposal. They said the records related to the disposals and soil testing are not digitized and make it difficult to discern whether certain areas are getting too much manure.
It’s common for hog confinement operators in Iowa to store manure for months and then spread the animal waste on fields. The fecal material contains nitrogen and phosphorus that crops need to thrive, although not in ideal ratios, so farmers might also use commercial fertilizers.
Iowa is the nation’s top pork-producing state, with about 24 million pigs at any given time. That stresses the environment, the researchers determined.
“In parts of the watersheds, manure produced exceeds the capacity of surrounding lands to absorb it as fertilizer,” the report says. “This surplus manure becomes waste, contributing to the contamination of surface and groundwater.”
A threat to paddlers?
Excessive bacteria concentrations are the most pervasive stream impairment in the state, according to a biannual analysis that is required by the federal government.
Water is sampled for E. coli bacteria to gauge its overall risk for pathogens that can sicken people. That includes a range of ailments from skin rashes to digestive diseases.
The state routinely monitors its park beaches for bacteria and their toxins and posts swim advisories when beach water is unsafe during summer months. There is no similar program that monitors streams.
And the rivers have more bacteria, according to the researchers’ analysis of sampling data.
For example, data from warm months of the year revealed that the Raccoon River near Fleur Drive in Des Moines exceeded safe swimming concentrations in a little more than half of the samples. The concentrations exceeded safe limits for recreational activities that require less contact with river water about 15% of the time.
Fecal bacteria can come from livestock and wildlife, and numerous human wastewater treatment facilities discharge into streams.
“Microorganisms, such as viruses and bacteria, that cause diseases in humans have been found in central Iowa’s waterbodies and pose risks to aquatic recreators,” the researchers concluded. “Targeted efforts to remove human and animal pathogen sources and improve monitoring are needed to reduce risks of illness.”
What’s next?
Polk County has said it will release the report next week. A spokesperson for the county declined to comment further about its release and how much the county spent to commission the report.
The researchers condensed their work into a summary that included a list of their primary concerns:
– Livestock manure and its regulation to prevention stream contamination.
– Nitrate and phosphorus pollution from agriculture.
– Pathogens from human and animal waste.
– Algal blooms that emit toxins and are fed by fertilizers and manure.
– Urban and rural land alterations close to streams that introduce contaminants and promote flooding and erosion.
They also developed about two dozen recommendations to improve water quality. Key among them are:
– The state should provide more money to improve wastewater treatment facilities that discharge to streams.
– The state should create a public database that shows where and how much manure is applied to land, and it should also take steps to reduce the impacts of manure on water quality. That includes reducing the overapplication of manure and regulating the timing of its application to reduce stream contamination.
– Prepare for further restrictions on drinking water contamination, including a potential reduction in the allowable amount of nitrate concentrations. Research has indicated that current regulations might not be sufficient.
– Implement “outcome-based” water quality conservation practices and improve row crop production sustainability.
– Improve data collection to further evaluate contaminants.
– Improve the understanding of health risks and communicate them to the public.
“The suggested initiatives not only address immediate concerns such as nutrient pollution, microbial contamination, and chemical spills, but also pave the way for long-term sustainability and resilience of the regions’ water resources,” the researchers concluded.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-26 00:00:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi executes Richard Jordan,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/25/mississippi-executes-richard-jordan/,"Richard Jordan, Mississippi's oldest and longest serving death row inmate, died by lethal injection Wednesday.","Richard Jordan, Mississippi’s longest serving and oldest death row inmate, died by lethal injection Wednesday evening at the Mississippi State Penitentiary nearly 50 years after he kidnapped and murdered Edwina Marter. 
The 79-year-old Vietnam War veteran who experienced post-traumatic stress disorder was pronounced dead at 6:16 p.m. 
“First I would like to thank everyone for a humane way of doing this. I want to apologize to the victim’s family,” Jordan said, adding thanks to his wife and lawyers and asking for forgiveness. 
“I love you very much,” he said as his last words. “I will see you on the other side, all of you.”
Prison officials confirmed Jordan was unconscious after injecting a sedative before following with injection of two other injection drugs – a check ordered by a federal judge who greenlighted the execution late last week. This was part of a federal lawsuit challenging the lethal injection protocol in which Jordan was a lead plaintiff. 
In January 1976, Jordan found himself desperate for money and made a plan to kidnap the family member of a bank employee and demand funds. The Vietnam War veteran had a job lined up and had moved his family to Louisiana, only to find the position was filled, according to his clemency petition. 
He spent a few days looking for work before calling the Gulfport bank where Charles Marter worked as the commercial loan agent. Jordan found the man’s address in the phonebook and went there, posing as an electric company worker to get the banker’s wife, Edwina, to open the door at gunpoint. Her toddler son was left unharmed at home. 
Jordan had Edwina drive to the DeSoto National Forest. As she tried to run away, Jordan shot in her direction, hitting her in the head. Afterwards, he called Edwina’s husband to demand $25,000 in ransom. After two failed money drops, Jordan was arrested. 
He went to trial that year and received a death sentence, only for it to be overturned multiple times due to questions about the legality of Mississippi’s death penalty law. It wasn’t until 1998 and four trials later that the sentence stuck. Then Jordan began years of appeals. 
Eric and Kevin Marter, the now-adult sons of Edwina, and her husband Charles did not travel to Parchman to witness the execution, but Edwina’s brother planned to attend with help of his family, Kevin Marter said. 
Family members left without offering comment. 
Ahead of the execution, Eric Marter said he wanted Jordan’s sentence to be carried out sooner rather than almost 50 years later after his mother’s death. 
“I don’t want him to get what he wants,” Marter, who was 11 in 1976, said about Jordan’s efforts to fight his death sentence. 
Jordan’s wife, Marsha, witnessed the execution along with his attorney Krissy Nobile of the Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel and his spiritual adviser, the Rev. Tim Murphy. Such advisers have been allowed to accompany death row inmates since a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
After the execution, Attorney General Lynn Fitch said her office has pressed for justice and was pleased to be able to provide the Marter family, friends and the community with closure. 
Leading up to the execution, Jordan petitioned the U.S Supreme Court and the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to step in. The appeals court denied a stay of execution Tuesday, and the high court denied request for a stay and writ of certiorari Wednesday afternoon – about an hour before the execution. 
Tuesday evening, Gov. Tate Reeves reviewed Jordan’s clemency petition and said he would not intervene in the execution, noting circumstances of the crime, how Jordan admitted his guilt, multiple trials and appeals. 
Frank Rosenblatt, a professor at the Mississippi College School of Law, submitted the clemency petition that included letters of support from at least a dozen people, including Jordan’s wife, his sister and a pastor. 
“Richard is all of these things: a patriot; a Vietnam Veteran; a man of faith; a good son, brother, and friend; and he is an exemplary inmate who has worked to prevent this type of crime from happening ever again,” Rosenblatt wrote in Jordan’s petition. 
Organizations including Death Penalty Action and Catholic Mobilizing Network circulated petitions that called on Reeves to stop Jordan’s execution citing similar factors, including how he experienced post-traumatic stress disorder from his military service. Death Penalty Action’s petitions were delivered to the governor’s office Tuesday. 
During an afternoon news conference, Parchman Superintendent Marc McClure said Jordan seemed talkative and was telling stories about his past. He had been moved to a holding cell Sunday evening, and before the execution he visited with family, his attorneys and spiritual advisers. 
He requested chicken tenders, French fries, strawberry ice cream and a rootbeer float for his last meal, prison officials said at the earlier news conference. 
Starting in the afternoon, demonstrators gathered outside Parchman in the Delta and the Governor’s Mansion in Jackson. Death Penalty Action also hosted a virtual vigil. 
Minutes before the execution, a group gathered outside the prison entrance and offered prayers for Edwina Marter, her family, Jordan and his family. Among them were Rev. Jeff Hood, an Arkansas-based spiritual adviser who has accompanied 11 death row inmates to the execution chamber and has spoken out against the death penalty. 
Jordan’s execution is the third in the past decade, with the most recent taking place in December 2022. 
Thirty six people remain on death row in Mississippi, and the Attorney General’s Office is seeking execution dates for three – Willie Jerome Manning, Robert Simon Jr. and Charles Ray Crawford.

(Photo by Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A bipartisan panel of Washington state lawmakers devoted to increasing civility in politics is formally denouncing the murder of a Minnesota state lawmaker and attempted assassination of Donald Trump as violent attempts to “undermine our democratic process.”
“Disagreements should not translate to violence. Furthermore, disagreements on policy never justify political violence, against anyone,” the Joint Select Committee on Civic Health declared in a statement approved at a meeting Wednesday.
The five-paragraph statement went on to condemn this month’s slaying of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, and last year’s two failed assassination attempts on Trump as he campaigned for president, as attempts by individuals to thwart the rule of law “simply because they disagree with something.”
Rep. Dan Bronoske, D-Lakewood, a committee member, called it a very clear statement that “we can’t revert to, let me put it bluntly, targeted assassinations of anyone who’s involved in politics, whether it’s the current president of the United States or the former Speaker of the House in Minnesota.”
Meanwhile, in Congress, the U.S. House unanimously approved a resolution Wednesday condemning the June 14 attacks on Hortman and Hoffman. 
The Washington state panel is made up of a dozen members, three from each of the Democratic and Republican caucuses in the House and Senate. It is chaired by Democratic Lt. Gov. Denny Heck, who has championed bringing greater civility to politics.
Sen. Ron Muzzall, R-Oak Harbor, said the violence is a result of an inability in politics to have “constructive dialogue” and to disagree without being disagreeable.
“The truth of the matter is, we’re trying to get in at the ground level to stop all of that,” he said, referring to the broader goals of the panel.
Later, after approving the statement, lawmakers pondered their next steps. Most agreed they needed to be more proactive in talking with those of the other political party and those with different views.
“The value of that cross-party relationship building is that ultimately it makes each of us feel valued and, I think, that’s such an alien concept sometimes,” said Rep. Chris Stearns, D-Auburn.
Heck suggested bringing in a leader of the National Institute for Civil Discourse and providing the lawmakers on the committee with training, making them “ambassadors” who could “spread the gospel of engaging with respect, seeking common ground and disagreeing constructively.”
The committee’s statement mirrors the tone of one put out by the leaders of the four legislative caucuses following the Minnesota attack.
“There is no doubt that this kind of political violence stokes panic and distrust in our system of democracy. We must stand united against it, no matter our party allegiance or personal beliefs,” said House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn, and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-25 23:48:42+00:00,CT Mirror,Kennedy’s new vaccine panel alarms pediatricians with inquiries into long-settled questions,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/25/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-panel/,"Kennedy's hand-picked seven-member committee announced inquiries into some long-settled questions, including the children’s vaccine schedule.","ATLANTA (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s new vaccine advisers alarmed pediatricians Wednesday by announcing inquiries into some long-settled questions about children’s shots.
Opening the first meeting of Kennedy’s handpicked seven-member panel, committee chairman Martin Kulldorff said he was appointing a work group to evaluate the “cumulative effect” of the children’s vaccine schedule — the list of immunizations given at different times throughout childhood.
Also to be evaluated, he said, is how two other shots are administered — one that guards against liver-destroying hepatitis B and another that combines chickenpox protection with MMR, the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.
It was an early sign of how the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is being reshaped by Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official. He fired the entire 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.
“Vaccines are not all good or bad,” Kulldorff said. “We are learning more about vaccines over time” and must “keep up to date.”
His announcement reflected a common message of vaccine skeptics: that too many shots may overwhelm kids’ immune systems or that the ingredients may build up to cause harm. Scientists say those claims have been repeatedly investigated with no signs of concern.
Kids today are exposed to fewer antigens — immune-revving components — than their grandparents despite getting more doses, because of improved vaccine technology, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
The American Academy of Pediatrics announced Wednesday that it would continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it “no longer a credible process.”
“The narrative that current vaccine policies are flawed and need ‘fixing’ is a distortion,” said the AAP’s Dr. Sean O’Leary. “These policies have saved trillions of dollars and millions of lives.”
The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they’re available, such as at pharmacies.
After Kennedy’s abrupt dismissal of the existing expert panel, a number of the CDC’s top vaccine scientists — including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings — have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.
And shortly before Wednesday’s meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist appointed to the committee stepped down. According to the Trump administration, he withdrew during a customary review of members’ financial holdings. 
Scientists show data that COVID-19 vaccines protect pregnant women and kids
First on the committee’s agenda Wednesday were COVID-19 vaccinations. Kennedy already sidestepped the panel and announced the vaccine will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women.
Yet CDC scientists told the panel that vaccination is “the best protection” during pregnancy, and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.
COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the CDC. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 — especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC’s presentation.
The new advisers weren’t asked to vote on Kennedy’s recommendations, which raise uncertainty about how easily people will be able to access COVID-19 vaccinations this fall.
After CDC staff outlined multiple overlapping systems that continue to track the vaccines’ safety, several advisers questioned if the real-world data really is trustworthy.
Vote on RSV protections is postponed
Also Wednesday, the committee took up RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.
In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants — a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women — that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. The antibody proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.
“People need to understand what a spectacular accomplishment these results are,” said ACIP member Dr. Cody Meissner, of Dartmouth.
The committee postponed until Thursday a vote on whether to recommend another company’s newly approved antibody shot as well.
Flu shot recommendations to be debated
At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps green light the annual fall vaccination campaign.
But a vote set for Thursday also promises controversy.
The panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism.
In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders. By Wednesday afternoon, the analysis had been removed from the committee’s website.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25176558180279-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 20:02:42.052503

[…],"Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill. (Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Attorney General Liz Murrill is pressing the Louisiana Supreme Court to come up with standards that she hopes will bring to an end the extended appeals of five people facing the death penalty. 
Murrill announced Wednesday she is filing writs with the state’s highest court regarding the post-conviction appeals available to persons sentenced to die. She takes issue with convicted defendants waiting decades to pursue relief, which then delays their executions.
Louisiana resumed the death penalty after a 15-year hiatus in March, when Jesse Hoffman, 46, was executed with nitrogen gas. He was convicted in the 1996 kidnapping, rape and murder of 28-year-old Mary “Molly” Elliot. She was abducted in New Orleans, then raped and killed in St. Tammany Parish.

“As I’ve said over and over, the family members of these victims deserve justice,” Murrill said in a statement. “It’s shameful they wait decades to see justice carried out. It serves no valid purpose. … I’m hopeful that the Louisiana Supreme Court will grant review to give clear direction to lower courts and we can finally move these cases forward.”
The attorney general said some district courts have acted on their own to create exceptions to a state law that already provides clear direction for post-conviction relief. State Supreme Court justices are being asked to provide uniform guidance for all courts to follow, Murrill said.
Cecelia Koppel, an attorney who represents clients on death row and directs the Center for Social Justice at Loyola University College of Law, said in a text message that the attorney general’s news release constitutes “meritless grandstanding.”
“The AG’s filings have nothing to do with speeding up cases, but instead seek to confuse, delay, and prevent these individuals from having their day in court,” Koppel said.
Murrill’s writs have been filed in the cases of Antoinette Frank, Robert Miller and Larry Roy, and more filings are planned Monday for David Henry Bowie and Marcus Reed, according to the attorney general’s office.
Frank, a former New Orleans police officer, is the only woman on death row in Louisiana. She was found guilty in the 1995 murders of her NOPD partner, Ronald Williams II, and sibling restaurant owners Ha and Cuong Vu. Rogers Lacaze, Frank’s co-conspirator in the botched armed robbery of Kim Ahn Noodles restaurant, was sentenced to life in prison.
Miller was given the death penality for the robbery, rape and fatal stabbing of his 67-year-old Baton Rouge landlord in 1997. The woman was not identified in court records.
Roy was convicted in the 1993 double murder of his ex-girlfriend’s ex-husband, Freddie Richard Jr., and her elderly aunt, Rosetta Silas, in Cheneyville. A Rapides Parish judge issued a death warrant for Roy in February, setting his execution date for March 29. But the warrant was withdrawn once District Attorney Phillip Terrell was made aware Roy had not exhausted all of his appeals.
Bowie was found guilty in East Baton Rouge Parish of strangling John Smith at Smith’s home after losing all of his money to him in a dice game, according to court records. Police said Bowie used shoelaces and the cord of a clothing iron to murder Smith.
Reed was convicted in Caddo Parish of killing brothers Jarquis, Jeremiah and Eugene Adams in 2010. Police said the fatal dispute was over an allegedly stolen video game console.
The five are among the 54 people facing execution in Louisiana.

Kelly Ayotte said Wednesday she had come to an agreement with legislative leaders after a week of disagreement over the budget. Here, Ayotte speaks during a March 12, 2025, press conference. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The chaotic final days of the New Hampshire budget process may soon be over. 
On Wednesday evening, hours before the House and Senate were scheduled to meet, Gov. Kelly Ayotte said she had come to an agreement with legislative leaders after a week of discord. 
The statement, released just after 6 p.m., did not specify what the agreement entails. But it suggested that some of the major issues Ayotte had raised with legislators’ previous proposal have been resolved.
“I am pleased we were able to reach a compromise that delivers a fiscally responsible and balanced budget for all of New Hampshire,” Ayotte said. “We have protected our most vulnerable, created an even brighter future for our children, and stood up for those who have made our state the safest in the nation.”
The agreement could provide an exit route yet for lawmakers who had been facing a potential budget veto and continuing resolution. But it will need to pass the House, where some Republicans have not been happy with the final budget. 
Lawmakers have until June 30 — Monday — to pass a funding agreement or the state could face a sweeping shutdown.
Here’s what you need to know ahead of Thursday’s votes. 
What is in lawmakers’ budget agreement reached last week?
While both the House and Senate passed their own versions of the budget at different points this spring, the latest version was passed last week by a “committee of conference” — a panel of House and Senate negotiators.
Most of that compromise agreement follows the version of the budget the Senate passed, and included more spending than the House’s version but less than what Ayotte wanted, according to an analysis by the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
But the negotiators added some new elements. Their budget reduced funding to the University System of New Hampshire, revised the “targeted aid” school funding formula to include a cap for large school districts, and rolled back an increase to retirement benefits for a key group of first responders championed by Ayotte. 
Those differences drove the wedge between Republicans that threatened the package’s future. Depending on the details, Wednesday evening’s agreement could remove that wedge. 
Why were the governor and Republican lawmakers at odds?
Within an hour of the committee of conference budget passing on June 12, Ayotte condemned changes it made to “Group II” benefits. Ayotte’s original budget had restored benefits that were reduced in 2011 to a group of about 1,500 police officers, corrections officers, and firefighters in order to address a funding hole in the pension fund; the committee of conference reduced funding toward that effort. 
Ayotte also raised concerns about funding cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services and a change to the school funding formula that gave Manchester public schools less money than her budget did. And she pledged a veto if those elements were not fixed. 
The veto pledge inspired a volley of harsh words between Ayotte and Senate President Sharon Carson, which aired publicly this week.
“We did not keep a promise to those law enforcement, firefighters, corrections (officers) in the system,” Ayotte said in a radio interview with Jack Heath on Monday, speaking about the 2011 changes. “We changed their retirement midstream, and I was trying to fix that. I ran on that. I thought it was important for recruitment and retention and trust.” 
Carson said Ayotte’s changes would be too expensive and could threaten the health of the retirement fund. 
“I have no idea what she’s trying to do,” Carson said on Tuesday, also speaking to Heath. “She is threatening 1.4 million people in the state of New Hampshire for the benefit of 1,550 people.” 
Under legislative rules, lawmakers are not allowed to make changes to the two budget bills, House Bill 1 and 2. Those must receive an up or down vote. But lawmakers could potentially choose a bill with a fiscal impact that had been tabled earlier in the session, remove it from the table, and attach an amendment that included the fixes agreed to by Ayotte and lawmakers Wednesday.
Such an agreement would still require the underlying budget to pass. Speaking before the compromise agreement was reached Wednesday, House Deputy Speaker Steven Smith said he would vote for the committee of conference budget. But he declined to comment about whether the rest of his Republican caucus would.
Senate Minority Leader Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, a Portsmouth Democrat, said Senate Democrats would oppose the budget, criticizing it for expanding education freedom accounts and containing too-little funding for social services.
“I think what has become clear is that the Republicans have decided to craft this budget following their own agenda,” Perkins Kwoka said in an interview. “And you know, it’s left them with few partners to work with.”
What happens if lawmakers vote down the budget agreement Thursday?
If the budget fails to pass in either the House or the Senate Thursday, there will be no funding agreement in place beginning July 1, the start of the next state fiscal year.
To prevent that outcome, Ayotte has raised the possibility of a continuing resolution should the budget fail. That would keep agencies funded at similar rates, without any of the policy changes in the current budget, while the House, Senate, and governor went back to negotiations. 
In order to pass a continuing resolution, a supermajority of two-thirds of lawmakers in each chamber would need to vote to allow a late legislative item. In the Senate, that would be 16 members; if all 16 Republicans voted in lockstep, they could do that.
But in the House, Republicans make up just about 55% of the body; depending on attendance, they would likely need Democratic votes to allow a continuing resolution to be passed. 
On Wednesday, the Executive Council formally approved Ayotte’s request for a special legislative session to be held Friday, as a contingency if lawmakers can’t pass a budget or a continuing resolution Thursday.
Smith blasted that idea, noting that many members have jobs or make plans on Fridays.
“That is the product of a rookie governor that has no clue how state government works,” Smith said. “You don’t just say on 72 hours notice ‘everyone come in on Friday.’ It’s not gonna happen.”
What might a continuing resolution look like?
In 2019, when Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed a budget passed by House and Senate Democrats, the Legislature passed a 90-day continuing resolution that kept funding even, for the most part.  That’s the arrangement that Ayotte asked for in her proposal for a special session that was approved Wednesday. 
But that’s not necessarily what might emerge this time. The Legislature could impose a longer or a shorter continuing resolution period, and lawmakers could change how much state agencies receive.
On Wednesday, Democrats suggested Republican leaders were favoring a continuing resolution proposal to fund the government at 90% of current levels, necessitating about $700 million in funding cuts. Republican lawmakers have not publicly commented on those plans.
Should that proposal come forward, Democrats would likely back a different short-term funding plan that moves forward with 100% of funding. But while lawmakers must vote with a two-thirds majority to suspend the rules, the passage of the continuing resolution itself would require only a majority vote, giving House and Senate Republicans more leeway. 
“What we’d like to see is that the CR is as close to current spending levels as revenue can support,” said Perkins Kwoka. “Because there’s a lot of programs that are really on the margin here. We’re talking about homeless shelters, we’re talking about SNAP, like there are places where they just can’t afford that cut.”
What happens if the Legislature does not pass a continuing resolution?
If no continuing resolution is passed, the state would be plunged into uncertainty. 
There is little precedent for this possibility. The state has passed its fiscal deadline without a continuing resolution just twice in modern history: in 1959 for two days, and in 1977 for 12 days, according to a 2013 paper by Joshua Elliott for the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think tank. 
Both instances were chaotic, according to the paper. Unlike the federal government, which can continue to maintain critical functions if Congress fails to authorize spending and initiates a shutdown, New Hampshire does not designate certain employees as “essential.” 
In both situations, lawmakers reached an agreement to give retroactive back pay to state employees in time for their paychecks. But in 1977, the state attorney general said state employees were not obligated to come to work if no spending agreement were in place, according to the paper. 
Today, there is another option for the state: emergency funding. RSA 9:13-d allows the governor to declare a civil emergency and ask the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee — a panel of House and Senate members — and the Executive Council to “authorize such expenditures, by any department or agency, as may be necessary to effectively deal with said civil emergency.”
The condition for invoking this is “such imminent peril to the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this state so as to require immediate action to remedy the situation.”
The state would continue to collect taxes even if there were no spending agreement in place; without a budget, that revenue would go to the state treasury as “funds not otherwise appropriated.” An emergency declaration could theoretically allow the governor to draw from those funds, with approval from the fiscal committee and council.
But the fix would be hamfisted at best. And the deep uncertainty — including to the state’s credit rating — means the possibility is not attractive to most lawmakers. 
“We have identified some potential contingency plans, at least, to keep critical operations going if a shutdown were to happen,” said Attorney General John Formella in an interview Wednesday.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3123149-Ayotte-bail-press-conference-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 20:02:42.052503

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)In the shadow of Three Mile Island’s iconic cooling towers, state Rep. Tom Mehaffie recalled Wednesday how his father, 50 years earlier, built a career and a life around the nuclear power plant. 
“When Constellation left and this plant shut down, a lot was missed,” Mehaffie said, noting the fortunes of businesses and the community followed that of the plant in Dauphin County. 
Now, state government and energy and tech industry leaders are betting on its rebirth as an example of Pennsylvania’s readiness to power future industries, including electricity-intensive artificial intelligence data centers. 
In a $16 billion deal between owner Constellation Energy and Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers, Three Mile Island is set to return to service as the Crane Clean Energy Center.
“Let’s not just open this plant, let’s open business,” Mehaffie told a tent full of Constellation Energy workers gathered to celebrate progress in the plant’s restoration, including an expedited review that cuts about a year off the project’s timeline.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
About 10 miles south of Harrisburg near Middletown, Three Mile Island was the site of a 1979 nuclear accident that transfixed the world. But after that partial meltdown in one of the plant’s two reactors, the remaining Unit 1 continued safely producing electricity for another 40 years. 
In 2019, Constellation determined the facility was no longer economically viable and put plans in motion to permanently decommission the reactor. With peak energy demand, driven largely by data centers, predicted to grow up to 17% by 2035, the plant’s capacity is now in high demand.
“We made a mistake in shutting down this plant, but we’re not here to dwell on that mistake,” Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said, noting that hiring staff for the recommissioning process is ahead of schedule because many former workers returned.
The plant’s reopening will support at least 650 permanent jobs and hundreds more for building-trade workers during the recommissioning process.

Gov. Josh Shapiro welcomed the returning workers Wednesday, as he highlighted the role of nuclear power in his energy plan.
“We’re going to make sure you never have to leave again,” Shapiro said. “This is going to be one of those places where the jobs get passed down from generation to generation, where fathers talk to their daughters about the work that they did, and their daughters pick up that mantle of energy leadership right here at Crane.”
Shapiro has outlined a plan over the last two years to ensure the commonwealth remains a leader in the competitive energy market, by leveraging the state’s natural gas resources while making it an attractive location for sustainable energy technologies. Part of the plan, now under consideration as a suite of bills before the General Assembly, is a goal to obtain 35% of the state’s energy from renewable sources by 2035.
Shapiro noted his administration intervened to ensure the Crane center would be able to quickly reconnect to the regional power grid that serves Pennsylvania and all or parts of 12 other states.
PJM Interconnect, which operates the grid and ensures adequate energy supplies, has a backlog of projects waiting to be approved for connection. The company created its Reliable Resource Initiative last year to expedite the interconnection of 51 shovel-ready generating resources that include battery storage, nuclear and natural gas facilities, a PJM spokesperson said.
Shapiro, who describes himself as an “all of the above energy governor,” noted the state has four operating nuclear power plants that provide nearly one-third of its energy.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Shapiro said. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy for Microsoft, said the Crane center is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring nuclear energy online with the speed needed to match the growth of artificial intelligence. 
“It’s a unique opportunity where we can bring together a supportive community, state and a skilled workforce that is absolutely the best kept secret ingredient,” Hollis said. 
Microsoft’s agreement to purchase all of the Crane center’s 835 megawatt output demonstrates the importance of abundant energy for tech industry growth, Shapiro said.
“That is a heck of a signal of the optimism people feel about Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said, noting that Amazon also recently announced a $20 billion investment in a data complex near the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear power plant in Luzerne County.
PJM interconnection president and CEO Manu Asthana said as the state swelters through its first heatwave of the summer, the growth in demand for energy is apparent. PJM this week recorded an all-time peak in electricity production, nine gigawatts larger than last summer’s peak. Asthana said the difference is equal to 11 times the Crane center’s planned output.
“What we’re talking about here is not hypothetical. Our country needs this power. All of our citizens need this power just to keep their lights on, to stay warm, to stay cool,” he said, adding that ensuring power for all that plus AI is a matter of national security.
“I can’t imagine by 2030 what artificial intelligence will enable us to do and strategically, for our country, for our state, for our region, it is critical that we win that race, and the power that you produce here is critical to winning that race.”

The Senate, however, probably won’t vote on the House-written mini-budgets before legislators begin their multi-week break on Thursday. 
“I think it’s unlikely that it’s something that we will take up or have time to take up,” Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters Wednesday. 
“We haven’t had conversations as to the contents of that bill, and if the idea is you’re going to send something over the day before we’re adjourning and haven’t had conversations with us and have some agreement or understanding as to what’s in there, I don’t think that’s a serious effort to do anything,” he said. 
The legislature will recess without having passed a new comprehensive budget to begin the fiscal year that starts July 1. House and Senate Republicans have not been able to bridge their considerable differences over spending and future taxation. 
Under state law, government operations will continue into the next fiscal year without a new budget, based on previously approved spending. But new government projects and raises for teachers and state employees remain in limbo. Legislators are discussing returning to Raleigh for a few days of work each month, if they have things to do. 
Senate Democrats criticized Republicans, who control both chambers, for failing to pass a budget. Approving a budget is the General Assembly’s main job. 
Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said legislators should not be going home without passing budget.
“Literally, lives are hanging in the balance,” she said. “Agencies need funding, and yet, we’re saying, ‘Oh, we’ll just tap out,’ because the Republicans who control the House and Senate can’t sit down and talk. 
“They need to be starting to put people over politics and they’re not doing that very well right now,” she said. 
Both the Senate and House have passed stop-gap budgets intended to fund a few projects leaders determined need new or extra funding beginning July 1. House Speaker Destin Hall said Tuesday his chamber would not consider the Senate proposal. 
House Republicans countered with two measures. These are the House-written bills Berger said the Senate is unlikely to consider. 
One House-written bill included provisions approved in the House version of a comprehensive budget during the spring that would give teachers average raises of 6.4% and state employees 2.5% raises. The bill would also cut state jobs by 20% across agencies. It passed the House on Wednesday 94-19.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Agriculture policy experts in a press conference Wednesday hosted by Environmental Working Group said the massive budget reconciliation bill waiting for debate and approval in the Senate, would drive further dependency on farm safety nets, and have negative effects on small- and medium-sized producers.
The bill pulls money from the federal nutrition programs and to pay for federal farm subsidies, which the analysts argued would go to “some of the wealthiest people in farm country.
The budget reconciliation bill, commonly referred to as the “one big beautiful bill” comprises budgets across the entire government, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture which oversees farm programs, and nutrition programs. Its budget is typically determined by omnibus legislation known as the Farm Bill.

Environmental Working Group reported USDA paid $279.4 billion in commodity subsidies in 2024, and that from 1995 through 2024, the top 10% of commodity farms received nearly 80% of commodity subsidy payments. 
Joshua Sewell, a director of research and policy at Taxpayers for Common Sense, said this trend would only get worse under the reconciliation bill, as it boosts crop guarantees and references prices by 10-20%. 
Sewell said the bill further prioritizes larger commodity farmers by eliminating a current provision that restricts farmers with adjusted gross incomes of $900,000 or more from receiving certain USDA benefits. It would also increase annual payment limits from $125,000 to $155,000 per person actively engaged in the farm. Sewell and others on the press call said means the taxpayer-funded payments could go to spouses and other family members associated with a farm.
“It’s the largest, most successful operators who are going to harvest most of the benefits of these loopholes and increases,” Sewell said.
The bill also authorizes the enrollment of up to 30 million new base acres, or a farm’s crop-specific acreage eligible for certain benefits. Sewell said it “virtually guarantees annual payments for peanuts, cotton and rice” because of significant increases to those crops’ reference prices and commodity title program spending. 
Sewell said those crops, which are primarily grown in southern states, are benefiting from “southern dominated” ag committees at the Capitol and lawmakers that are “padding the pockets of their own self interests and their states.”
Sewell said senators should reject the massive spending in the bill and instead focus on tailoring safety nets and social programs “to actual need” and spending “at a level that we can afford.” 
“This bill advocates austerity and food aid, while deepening dependency on farm subsidies for, as has been mentioned, only a select few,” Sewell said. “It’s the exact opposite of what our nation and our farmers need.” 
Ferd Hoefner, former policy director at National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, said the bill would lead to more farm consolidation, economic concentration and a harder time for beginning farmers and small- to medium-sized farm operations trying to compete in the rental and real estate markets.
“It’s just going to further consolidate an already consolidated commodity industry,” Hoefner said. “It’s a waste of taxpayer resources … And it makes total fallacy out of the idea that we have a farm safety net — it is not a safety net, it is a commodity support system, virtually without limits.” 
Hoefner said there have been efforts in the past, supported by Republican lawmakers, to add stricter subsidy rules and to close loopholes in the system via Farm Bill policies.  
“I guess that was yesterday when they had a different philosophical belief,” Hoefner said. “But now, the more for the 1% the better.”
Paying for subsidies with cuts to SNAP
An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office of the bill’s agriculture provisions found the bill would dramatically decrease spending on nutritional programs, by cutting funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by about 30%,  while increasing spending for farm subsidies. 
The analysis predicts the bill’s cuts to the SNAP program will have net savings of $294.7 billion from the federal deficit over the next 10 years, but also shows the bill increases spending on farm assistance and other programs by $56.4 billion over the next 10 years. 
Sewell said the move to drastically cut from SNAP is a political “bait and switch” used in Farm Bill negotiations before. He said while farm subsidy regulations are put in effect almost immediately after a bill passes, the SNAP and nutrition provisions usually have longer implementation dates and get changed before they are implemented.  
“The siren song of slashing SNAP is repeatedly used to distract from the real goal of the ag committees, which is raiding the Treasury for politically favored crops,” Sewell said. 
According to the CBO figures, 93% of the total increase to ag spending comes from changes to the “farm safety net” or farm programs and crop insurance.
U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-AR, as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Chairman said in a June 11 statement the reconciliation bill takes a “commonsense approach” reforming SNAP and helping rural Americans.
“It’s about being good stewards of taxpayer dollars while giving folks the tools to succeed,” Boozman said. “At the same time, our farmers and ranchers are facing real challenges, which have been unaddressed for too long. This legislation delivers the risk management tools and updated farm bill safety net they need to keep producing the safest, most abundant and affordable food, fuel, and fiber in the world.”  
Senate Democrats removed language Monday from the House version of the bill that would have shifted some of the SNAP costs to individual states. 
Researchers: Reconciliation process harms the bipartisan nature of farm policy
Researchers from the University of Illinois and Ohio State University in a review of the CBO analysis said the reconciliation process, if the bill passes, would have “effectively broken the larger Farm Bill coalition that has made reauthorization possible for over 50 years.”  
“The bill violates one of the cardinal rules of Farm Bill politics by reducing food assistance to offset increases in farm assistance,” the researchers wrote. 
Sewell said lawmakers in the agriculture committees are “abusing” the reconciliation process to “pad the pocketbooks” of “politically favored farm interests.”  
“And frankly, they’re doing it at the expense of our nation’s fiscal health,” Sewell said. “We need a fiscally responsible Farm Bill. We want a fiscally responsible farm bill, but we need lawmakers to ensure both food and farm safety nets are affordable and effective.”  
The Farm Bill, which is typically reauthorized every five years, was last passed in 2018 and Congress failed to reauthorize, choosing instead to extend the 2018 policies, in 2023 and 2024. 
The budget reconciliation process is an expedited process for considering bills and policies by embedding them in a congressional budget resolution and allowing the policy to pass with a simple majority in the Senate. 
A press release from National Corn Growers Association expressed a similar frustration in wrapping farm policy into the budget reconciliation bill. 
 “NCGA’s farmer leaders have long stood on the policy position that farm bills should be comprehensive and bipartisan, and that they should include farm programs and nutrition programs,” the organization’s president Kenneth Hartman Jr. said. “Given that budget reconciliation provides only a partial pathway for select components of the farm bill, we would like return to a bipartisan, comprehensive approach to future farm bill debates.”  
The group, which represents corn growers across the country, acknowledged the bill fulfills some of the legislative priorities the it had, like expanding farm insurance support for beginning and veteran producers, doubling funding for the Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Program, and “strengthening” the farmer safety net with modifications including a reference price increase for corn.  
“However, corn growers remain concerned with the imbalance of investment across various commodities and potential impacts of the changes to the (Price Loss Coverage) program,” the statement read. “The legislation unfairly expands the concept only to corn growers.” 
The budget reconciliation bill passed the House at the end of May and U.S. senators are expected to begin their “vote-a-rama” of the massive piece of legislation any day now. 
Sewell said the language in the budget reconciliation bill would not have made it through either chamber’s ag committees as a normal Farm Bill. 
“Lawmakers, thus, in our opinion, should reject this flawed Farm Bill and demand an actual Farm Bill debate outside of reconciliation,” Sewell said.

Free.,"Trump drive to defund NPR, PBS resisted by Republicans from rural states",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-drive-defund-npr-pbs-resisted-republicans-rural-states,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s request to claw back $9.4 billion in previously approved spending on foreign aid and public media ran into significant opposition Wednesday, potentially dooming its path forward in the Senate. Numerous GOP lawmakers on the Appropriations Committee, including Chairwoman Susan Collins, expressed concern at how the proposed rescissions would affect American “soft power” as well as local radio and television stations that rely on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — many in rural America.Collins, R-Maine, highlighted opposition to cutting already approved funding for CPB, which goes toward National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service and hundreds of local stations outside the nation’s larger metropolitan areas. “The vast majority of this funding, more than 70%, actually flows to local television and radio stations,” Collins said. “In Maine this funding supports everything from emergency communications in rural areas to coverage of high school basketball championships and a locally produced high school quiz show. Nationally produced television programs such as ‘Antiques Roadshow,’ ‘Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,’ are also enjoyed by many throughout our country.” Collins said she understands objections to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting providing funding to national NPR operations, given what she called its “discernibly partisan bent.”“There are, however, more targeted approaches to addressing that bias at NPR than rescinding all of the funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” Collins said.Effect on AlaskaAlaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski appeared to signal she also opposes cancelling funding that Congress previously approved for public media and told White House budget director Russ Vought that she wanted him to understand the ramifications on her home state.“I hope you feel the urgency that I'm trying to express on behalf of people in rural Alaska, and I think in many parts of rural America, where this is their lifeline, this is where they get the updates on that landslide, this is where they get the updates on the wildfires that are coming their way,” Murkowski said.“And so how they will be able to not only get the emergency alerts that they need, but also the weather reporting to make sure that fishermen … can go out safely. So that these communities can be connected when a deadly landslide has come through,” she said.Rural radio in South Dakota, NebraskaSouth Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds pressed Vought to ensure uninterrupted federal funding to local radio stations in rural areas of his home state, even if Congress rescinds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s appropriation.“First of all, we have Native American radio stations in South Dakota. They get their funding through NPR – 90 some percent of what they use. They will not continue to exist if we don't find a way to take care of their needs,” Rounds said. “It's not a large amount of money, but would you be willing to work with us to try and find a way for these places where, literally, they're not political in nature?“These are the folks that put out the emergency notifications. They talk about community events and so forth. But they're in very, very rural areas where there simply isn’t an economy to support buying advertising on these stations.”Vought appeared to agree to work with Rounds, before saying that if Congress approves the rescissions request for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the administration wouldn’t pull back funding until the next fiscal year, which starts on Oct. 1. Vought also pledged to work with Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer to ensure people in rural areas will have a way to learn about emergency alerts if the rescissions request is approved.“I am very concerned also about the emergency alerts that come to many places in Nebraska only through that rural radio,” Fischer said. “We're a state of vastness, very sparsely populated areas that don't receive cell service in many cases. It's difficult even with landlines in many areas of my state.”Reductions to AIDS reliefChairwoman Collins also said during the nearly three-hour hearing that cutting funding on certain global health programs, including the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, “would be extraordinarily ill-advised and short-sighted.”“PEPFAR has saved more than 26 million lives and enabled 7.8 million babies to be born HIV-free to mothers living with HIV,” Collins said. “This program remains a bipartisan priority of Congress. After years of commitment and stable investment the finish line is in sight. The United States has the tools to fulfill PEPFAR’s mission and get the job done while transitioning HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention to country ownership by the year 2030.”Collins argued that the Trump administration is unlikely to spend foreign aid dollars on the same “questionable projects” that were part of the Biden administration.“Unless the current administration plans to continue these controversial projects that it has identified — which I very much doubt — those projects alone cannot be used to justify the proposed rescissions,” Collins said.Just before Vought began giving his opening statement to the committee, a group of protesters in the room stood up and began to yell in an attempt to preserve PEPFAR funding. They were escorted out by U.S. Capitol Police.Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the Defense spending subcommittee and former majority leader, appeared to reject some of the proposed foreign aid cuts, arguing they eroded American influence around the world.“There's plenty of absolute nonsense masquerading with American aid that shouldn't receive another bit of taxpayer funding. But the administration's attempt to root it out has been unnecessarily chaotic,” McConnell said.“In critical corners of the globe, instead of creating efficiencies, you've created vacuums for adversaries like China to fill. Responsible investments in soft power prevent conflict, preserve American influence and save countless lives at the same time. So if we're concerned about spending, and we should be, it's important to remember what wars cost.”South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, however, announced that he will vote for the rescissions package, arguing that some ways the Biden administration spent funds in the PEPFAR account deserved rebuke. ""No more preaching to me. I'm going to vote for this package. And do you know why I'm going to vote for this package? Just as a statement that PEPFAR is important but it's not beyond scrutiny,” Graham said. “That how you run the government has consequences. Don't lecture me about being mean or cruel.""How rescissions workThe Trump administration sent Congress the $9.4 billion rescissions request in early June, allowing the White House budget office to legally freeze funding for the various programs included in the proposal for 45 days while lawmakers decide whether to approve or reject it.The request called on lawmakers to zero out funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting during the next two fiscal years, a total of $1.1 billion in previously approved spending.It proposed more than $8 billion in cuts to numerous foreign aid accounts run by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, including health programs, initiatives that promote democracy, economic development, peacekeeping activities and refugee assistance.One of the rescissions proposed lawmakers claw back $500 million of the $4 billion that Congress previously approved for “activities related to child and maternal health, HIV/ AIDS, and infectious diseases.“This proposal would not reduce treatment but would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like ‘family planning’ and ‘reproductive health,’ LGBTQI+ activities, and ‘equity’ programs.”The House voted mostly along party lines in June to approve the request in full, sending it to the Senate, where it has been on the sidelines for weeks as Republicans instead work toward an agreement on the party’s “big, beautiful bill.”The rescissions bill isn’t subject to the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, so it only needs the support of 50 Republicans and Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote to become law. That, however, must happen before the 45-day clock runs out on July 18.If Senate leaders do not schedule a floor vote, or that vote does not get the necessary support, the Trump administration would have to spend the funding as previously planned. And the White House budget office would be blocked from sending up a rescissions request for the same accounts for the remainder of President Donald Trump’s time in office.Senate floor consideration also comes with unlimited amendment debate, giving senators from both parties the chance to call for votes on whether to keep or eliminate each proposed rescission.Any changes to the bill would require it to go back across the Capitol for a final vote in the House before the deadline.",,,,2025-06-25 20:02:42.052503

That was before the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion protecting abortion based on privacy in Roe vs. Wade in 1973.
“He told me the story of staying at the bedside of a woman all night watching her die as the police hounded her to get her to tell them the name of the doctor that performed her abortion,” Cahill said in written remarks. “She refused. Jim vowed after that that if abortion ever became legal, he would learn how to do it as part of his family practice training. He kept his promise.”
The late Dr. James Armstrong is the same person in the often cited Armstrong vs. State of Montana case from 1999, in which the Montana Supreme Court found abortion to be protected as part of the privacy provision in the state Constitution.
Abortion remains generally legal in Montana, but Tuesday marked the third anniversary of the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturned federal privacy protections for abortion, and this week, medical providers and advocates for reproductive freedom are assessing milestone changes in medical care since Roe.
Cahill, who worked with Armstrong in Montana for years, shared a talk she gave in spring 2024 about providing abortion care in her career and her work with Armstrong, and other advocates shared reports with other anecdotes.
In her talk, Cahill said when she came to Montana to work with Dr. Armstrong in 1976, “he was so busy performing abortions that he could not take care of his regular family practice patients.
“I helped fill that need.”
Earlier, when she was in training in inner city New York, Cahill said she cared for terrified teenagers.
“I took care of 11- and 12-year-old girls in labor from rape by their fathers or brothers, or another family member, in pain and frightened, screaming for their mothers, not understanding what was happening to them,” Cahill said.
In 2002, she said, she was asked to set up a reproductive health clinic at the University of Rochester in upstate New York, a couple of years after medication abortion had become legal.
Rochester had a significant Somali refugee population, and Cahill wrote about helping one woman in particular through a medication abortion.
“Complete female circumcision is practiced in Somalia,” Cahill wrote. “It’s called infibulation. A woman’s complete labia is removed from the urethra to the anus, and the lacerated tissue is joined together with what becomes scar tissue.
“Only two very small holes are allowed to remain, one for urine and one for menstrual blood. When a Somali woman marries, a physician cuts through that scar tissue in order for her to have intercourse with her husband, and confirmation that she is a virgin.”
She said the Somali woman she saw couldn’t speak English well, but she said “he” had “put water on her” while she was sleeping, and she hadn’t had her menstrual cycle since.
Cahill said she examined the woman and was shocked to see the infibulation, and after an abdominal ultrasound, she learned the woman was six weeks pregnant.
If the woman had to continue the pregnancy, she likely would have been thrown out of her refugee community, and probably would have killed herself, Cahill said. She said surgical abortion was out of the question because of her “female circumcision,” but providers gave her a medication abortion.
“When she returned for her two-week checkup, having bled so she knew we had gotten her period going again, all she could do was hold my hands and kiss them continually. Her smile would have blinded you,” Cahill said.
This week, Montanans for Choice Take Action released several reports with more recent experiences women have had related to abortion care and restrictions. One report discusses six deaths in Texas and Georgia.
Another, called “The Rise of Pregnancy Criminalization,” said Montana hasn’t seen many cases of criminalization, but it said the state is primed “for lawmakers to promote and enforce laws to control people’s pregnancies.”
It shared a December 2024 story from Texas, citing coverage from the Los Angeles Times. It said a Texas woman spent five months in prison after having a miscarriage in a restaurant bathroom stall.
“After restaurant employees contacted authorities, the woman and fetal remains were taken to a hospital,” the report said. “The woman was detained, charged with abuse of a corpse, and remained in prison for five months before charges were dismissed. She was held in jail despite the medical examiner’s determination she had a miscarriage and the fetus was nonviable.”
It said Montana is one of 11 states with a broad “personhood provision” in legal code. The Montana Abortion Control Act of 1999 “reaffirms the tradition of the state of Montana to protect every human life, whether unborn or aged, healthy or sick,” but it also said Montana courts have generally found the law’s provisions to be unconstitutional.
Armstrong’s obituary said the clinic he and Cahill shared was destroyed by arson in the winter of 1994.
In 2014, an arsonist destroyed Cahill’s original All Families Healthcare, and four years later, Helen Weems, a nurse practitioner, opened up a new All Families Healthcare to carry on the legacy, according to the Flathead Beacon.
Published on the Buffalo Hill Funeral Home & Crematory site, Armstrong’s obituary said he worked 35 years before he retired. After Roe, it said, he incorporated “safe, legal abortion work” into his family practice in Kalispell.
“In addition, he found great satisfaction from delivering the babies of women he had himself delivered years earlier,” the obituary said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1422564336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 20:02:42.052503

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)As a June heatwave scorches through Rhode Island, labor tensions threaten to boil over in the state’s health care sector. 
Unionized nurses at Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital voted Monday night to authorize a potential strike, while medical and support staff at Butler Hospital, off the job since May 15, were formally deemed locked out by the state’s labor department on Tuesday, making them eligible for unemployment benefits. 
“We are feeling strong and unstoppable — now management’s only option is to sit down with us and come to a fair and equitable agreement for everyone,” Joe Maini, a mental health worker at Butler and member of the bargaining committee, said in a Tuesday night statement. 
The United Nurses and Allied Professionals (UNAP) Local 5098 represents roughly 2,500 nurses, case managers and technical and support staff who work at Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital, both in Providence. SEIU 1199NE represents the 800-strong Butler workforce which comprises the nursing, clerical, dietary, technical and mental health staff at the Providence psychiatric hospital. 
Both unions’ contracts expired on March 31, and both will have the chance to hash things out again with their employers.
On Wednesday, Butler workers and owner Care New England returned to the bargaining table after two days of bargaining last week proved fruitless. 
“Our commitment remains strong: to reach a sustainable agreement that values our workforce and supports Butler Hospital’s mission,” said Mary E. Marran, Butler’s president and COO, in a statement Wednesday. 
Marran pointed people to the ButlerInfoForYou.org website, which went live in late January ahead of contract talks, for additional information on the day’s negotiations. The site has become a public landing for management’s side of the bargaining saga. A newsfeed on the site was updated with developments from 10:15 a.m. Wednesday, noting that the hospital and union’s bargaining committees had convened. 
The negotiations come a day after the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training ruled that unionized workers at Butler can receive unemployment dating back to June 1, when the hospital informed picketing staff that it intended to find their permanent replacements. That maneuver, labor officials determined, amounted to a “constructive lockout” under state law, as the hospital cut off strikers’ wages and benefits while paying temporary laborers. 
Strike notice ‘in hand’ 
Meanwhile, over at  Brown University Health — the parent organization of Rhode Island and Hasbro hospitals — spokesperson Kelly Brennan told Rhode Island Current on Wednesday that while a new, formal negotiating session has not yet been scheduled, the two parties are scheduled to meet Monday.
“They’re resuming talks, but it’s not a negotiation session,” Brennan said.
Brennan added that a hospital statement issued Tuesday was still applicable. According to the written statement, the hospital submitted its “last, best and final offer” on June 6, one Brennan described as a “competitive and comprehensive [offer], reflecting months of good-faith bargaining.” 
The hospital offered a “market-competitive proposal” with retroactive raises, step and COLA pay adjustments, and benefits totaling $50 million spread across the next three years. The union voted to reject that offer.
UNAP and Brown Health have been negotiating since January, ahead of their seven-year contract’s expiration. All in all, there have been 26 negotiating sessions with no conclusion.

Unions are required to give 10 days notice for a strike.  
According to Brennan, if notice is given, “Rhode Island Hospital is fully prepared to activate its comprehensive strike plan” which could cost the hospital “tens of millions of dollars in temporary staffing to ensure continuity of care.”
About a dozen UNAP members gathered Tuesday afternoon to host a press conference near Rhode Island Hospital to challenge their employer’s claims. Most of the workers huddled underneath the shade of a tree to avoid the oppressive afternoon heat. Frank Sims, the UNAP 5098 president and a worker at the hospital, took to the microphone to call the contract “unacceptable.”
“Management’s last offer was insulting and does nothing to improve the recruiting, retention or employee morale,” Sims said. “The members of this union are tired of seeing their coworkers, new and experienced, leave for greener pastures in neighboring states where the pay and benefits are better and healthcare workers are treated with the dignity they deserve.”
Lynn Blais, the president of the entire UNAP organization, said the strike notice was “in hand” and that the union and Monday’s meeting  had “probably the largest turnout we’ve ever had for a membership vote.”  
What did Blais think about Brennan’s statement that the hospital would spend millions in temporary labor?
“We would tell them to take the money that they want to budget for scabs…and invest it in the workers today,” Blais said.
Health care costs a stumbling block 
Prominent in both labor disputes is employer-sponsored health coverage. The UNAP workers say Brown Health’s most recent contract proposal would shift $1 million in health insurance costs onto union members at the cost of more than $1,000 per insured worker.
Butler workers lost their health insurance on May 31 and have cited lackluster health benefits in several iterations of management’s proposals. Care New England appeared ready to address this at Wednesday’s negotiations, and posted to its website that it was unveiling a new health care package that adds a second $0 premium plan for full-time employees and further reduces premiums across tiers. Otherwise, the new offer is the same as the package submitted June 5, that raised minimum wages to at least $18.03 for all employees and created a $100,000 support fund for workers injured by on-the-job violence.
Butler striking workers and management return to bargaining table

A 2024 brief by the Rhode Island Business Group on Health (RIBGH) attributed employers’ rising health insurance expenditures to growing hospital costs, which now make up nearly half the total spending for commercial insurance plans.
Al Charbonneau, executive director of RIGBH, said in a Wednesday afternoon phone call that he’s no champion of unions. After all, he previously spent time on the other side of the equation as a hospital manager. 
“What strikes me is when I look at hospital expenses, I don’t see the money going into labor, frankly,” Charbonneau said. “I’m a management person, but…you know, try to run a hospital without a nurse. Just try to do it.”
Things have changed over the past two decades, Charbonneau said, with one tide in particular carrying the sea change: The rise of hospital systems, which tend to incur substantial development costs, and ultimately raise prices with minimal impact on quality of care. Salaries also seem to lack “strategic thinking,” Charbonneau said, “because it’s all going up about 3% a year over the last 10 to 12 years.” 
“Then the hospitals go to the General Assembly and say, ‘We need more nurses. We need to pay our nurses more.’ And the question is, where did the money go?’”",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8323-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 19:08:34.847561

A tiny independent school, beloved by parents and students, struggled with finances despite recent fundraising efforts.

This story by Robert F. Smith, with additional reporting by Jeff Potter was first published in The Commons on June 24.
WESTMINSTER — After completing its 25th school year of operation, the Compass School recently and abruptly announced that it will be permanently closing.
Though it had planned on operating for at least another year, financial difficulties the school had been facing for some time proved worse than expected.
Those lingering problems, combined with what its board president termed a “domino effect” of circumstances, prompted the school’s board of directors to unanimously vote to close the school immediately.
Debts of $250,000, declining enrollment, and the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic were cited as the combination of reasons for the board’s decision.
Compass was founded in 1999 with the purpose of providing the region with an alternative to traditional education, particularly for middle-school-age children. As the years progressed, it added more grades until it served students in grades 7 to 12.
In an email sent June 9, Board Chair Christine Armiger and Co-heads of School Gabe Allen-Fahlander and Louise Hodson told families that “on Friday, June 6th, we learned that a key piece of our financial plan for next year has fallen through. Without it, there is no way for us to open the school for the 2025-26 school year.”
With “a heavy heart and deepest admiration for everyone at the Compass School,” Armiger, Allen-Fahlander and Hodson informed the community of the board’s decision.
The letter was sent out after the school year had wrapped up, with staff and students expecting the school to be operating for at least another full year ahead.
The building, at 7892 US-5, has been closed up since, and the school’s website has been scrubbed of almost all content and states, “Founded in 1999 by dedicated educators and parents, Compass has closed its doors after 26 years of innovative education.”
A domino effect
In its letter, the directors explained that throughout the last three months the board, staff and community came together and “worked incredibly hard to save the school, raising extensive funds and expanding board membership, as well as bringing in outside expertise as consultants and advisors.”
But the board said that “ultimately, these efforts could not overcome a financial deficit that made it impossible to offer another year of programming.”
Armiger spoke to The Commons on June 23, prefacing her remarks with her intention of being “respectful to parents, teachers, students, and alumni who worked overtime to do what they could to propel us forward” in their attempts to keep the Compass School alive.
She said the school had been struggling with a number of forces, including an overall decline of the population of school-age children of more than 25% between 2000 and today, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
In its annual 990 form filed with the IRS — analogous to a tax return for the nonprofit world — the school posted healthy yearly surpluses from 2011 to 2015. Starting in 2016, the filings show a number of years of losses even before the pandemic hit in 2020.
Meanwhile, the school “that thrived on its smallness” and not long ago had more than 70 students ended with approximately 50 students in its final year.
The school went public with its financial problems this past winter, sparking a series of fundraising efforts that raised at least $68,000 toward the $250,000 budget deficit, the Brattleboro Reformer reported in April.
Armiger said that between those fundraising successes and the school community envisioning a smaller and more sustainable program, things were looking up. In April, the school announced on an Instagram post that it would open for the next year.
Then came what she called “the domino effect.”
First, a new “wonderful and significant” donor, excited for a long-term relationship with the school, could not commit to a significant donation immediately, Armiger said.
“We still felt confident that a bridge loan we applied for could still get us through [in conjunction with] another outreach campaign to bring in support we’d need until the other money came in,” she said.
But then the bridge loan was denied, which Armiger called “the nail in the coffin.”
Looking back, she said that the overall environment for independent schools is “another tough reality.”
Armiger, a science instructor and director of environmental programs and sustainability at Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, said that “another tough reality is that it’s hard even for schools with significant endowments.” As a young school, Compass never had the opportunity to build wealth and resources, and the community itself is not a place where “you can wrangle up a few hundred thousand in a pinch.”
Instead, she said, the school “absolutely overextended itself with financial aid.”
Two other factors stressed the vulnerable school, Armiger noted. The first was the “declining ability for private-pay families to pay tuition” based on the skyrocketing costs that have hit every family budget hard in the years since the pandemic.
The second was the school’s reliance on tuition funds for students from towns that offer that option. Presuming that Gov. Phil Scott will sign into law the state education reform bill, passed by both the House and the Senate, new reforms and restrictions will curtail which towns can offer that option to its youth.
Heavy hearts
Compass held what has become its last graduation ceremony, for 14 students, on May 31. It ended the year with approximately 50 students and 12 staff.
The school, once described on its website as “the perfect place to get inspired, take risks, learn from mistakes, get invested in your education, and be surprised by what you can do,” prided itself in “developing strong thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and collaborative workers with the ability to adapt to changing conditions.”
Westminster resident Charmion Handy, parent of a former Compass student, said the announcement was unexpected and came as a shock and that she was “saddened to hear of its closing.”
“Compass School taught our children how to be lifelong learners,” she said. “They provided a learning environment that was rich and diverse, balancing traditional studies with hands-on opportunities to explore topics of interest.”
Rick Gordon, one of the school’s founders, called Compass “a model for what is possible in education.”
Gordon served as the school’s longtime director and retired in 2020 after more than 20 years there.
“We were honored to attract extraordinary educators who had undying belief in every child and unparalleled dedication to supporting every student in their academic and personal growth,” he said. “It was the highlight of my career to be part of this incredible community.”
Molly Bruce Patterson, a board member, alum, and Bellows Falls resident, said, “It is hard to express how much Compass has shaped my life since graduating in 2004.”
Gus Shepard, an executive board member and a member of the first graduating class, said that “students often share how their lives were transformed by their Compass experience, and parents frequently express that Compass saved their child.”
Handy agreed. “Whether it was through Community Service Week, Project Week, or the various class trips throughout New England and abroad, students were exposed to a world beyond,” she said.
She noted that in addition to educating the students, Compass “had a unique way of including parents and families, by encouraging community service at the school, sharing knowledge to students in the classroom or at after-school activities or for the many parent-focused workshops.”
“I am so incredibly grateful that my children experienced this educational opportunity and have grown to be good people as a result of their Compass School experience,” she said.
Shepard said that many students who faced challenges in more traditional educational settings went on to achieve great success in college, careers, and communities. “Unfortunately, demographic shifts in the region led to a significant decline in student enrollment compared to when the school began,” he added.
Hodson, the co-head of school, was also the longest-serving teacher at Compass.
“I am heartbroken to close our doors,” she said. “I am saddened for the future students who will miss the opportunity to participate in our community. Thank you to all the teachers, students, and families who have worked to keep our doors open. We take immense pride in the educational experiences we have provided to so many learners.”
What’s next
Windham Northeast Supervisory Union Superintendent Andy Haas said that the closing of Compass “came as a shock to us.”
“Compass has been part of our community for many years, meeting the needs of students and families,” he said. “WNESU has enjoyed our relationship with Compass.”
He said that the district looks forward “to welcoming students to Bellows Falls Middle School and Bellows Falls Union High School. We have been communicating with families since the announcement and will continue to ensure the transition to our schools is as seamless as possible.”
Haas said that approximately 22 WNESU families are affected by the closing. Two of the students are middle schoolers, the rest are high schoolers.
Haas said he knows of three who have requested to attend Green Mountain Union High School in Chester, or Leland & Gray Union High School in Townshend.
As for BFUHS, Haas said that “we have already registered several students.”
As to what will happen with the school building and its 8.8-acre parcel if the school’s corporate entity dissolves, it must turn over remaining assets to another nonprofit once it has resolved its financial obligations.
The school’s bylaws stipulate that its assets must be directed towards meaningful educational endeavors. According to data from the town listers, the total assessed value of the land and building is $2,181,700.
A June 9 news release from the Compass board noted that, “proceeds from the sale of the building are expected to establish a foundation to support personalized learning and continue the kinds of educational experiences that have defined [the school].”
That degree of finality is tough for those who loved the school and worked to keep it alive.
“I love my work on the board at the Compass School — a school that’s so deeply embedded in the community,” Armiger said. “I love its origin story and think that against our better judgment we kept it going as long as we possibly could for the sheer love of it.”
Faculty, she said, “loved working at that school and couldn’t imagine working at another school because they loved working there so much.”
“I think there are still some of us who hold out hope or dream that a sustainable version of school could emerge,” Armiger said. “But it’s hard to imagine right now in this moment.”

This story by Cassandra Hemenway was first published in The Bridge on June 24.
Overshadowed by the recent detention of two migrant workers in Vermont, the annual mobile Mexican Consulate event at Christ Church in Montpelier brought at least 132 people from around Vermont to the capital city on Saturday, June 21. Notably fewer people attended compared to last year, when over 200 attended.
Organizers and participants alike were palpably aware of the June 14 detentions of the two members of Migrant Justice (a sponsor of the event). In prior years, the event would spill into the Christ Church courtyard, with food, tables for eating and socializing, music, outdoor health checks and up to three entrances into the building. This year — because of heightened awareness of raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Border Patrol that have increased under the Trump administration — there was only one entrance and exit, according to Deb Jerard, a Christ Church co-warden. 
Peppy fiddle notes rang from the courtyard, thanks to the Vermont Fiddle Orchestra and Make Music Day, a local event happening at the same time, but organizers decided to keep everything else inside the building.
Asked if the church felt like it needed extra precautions this year, Gerard responded “Yeah, we were more concerned, definitely.”
Nonetheless, Gerard said, the Boston-based Mexican consulate, which holds mobile events throughout New England, “kept reassuring us that they have not had any problem with these events.”
Security was also on hand, according to a staff member from Migrant Justice, and there were a couple of incidents that made people jumpy. One volunteer at the event told another that someone had been in the building “taking notes” — then realized at least two reporters had stopped by. Another told a Mexican consulate worker about a “suspicious vehicle” — a large black SUV with dark tinted windows — that had been idling behind the church for 30 minutes. (It turned out not to be an issue).
One participant, Olga (who asked that The Bridge not use her last name), noted that the risk of an ICE detention is on everyone’s minds right now.
“Given the current political situation, there’s nowhere that’s safe, whether we’re at home in bed, or here at the consulate, there’s always the risk of detention,” Olga said, through a translator.
Olga said she came to the event to update some documents, and while there, also got a blood glucose test from Bridges to Health, a migrant health program through the University of Vermont Extension.
“I also come in to help share information about Migrant Justice and knowing your rights with my communities,” she said.

Bridges to Health had three medical providers on hand, and was joined by the People’s Health and Wellness Clinic (a free clinic in Barre), which offered vaccinations, noted Naomi Wolcott-MacCausland, who oversees migrant health programs with Bridges to Health.
“When the consulate comes to this area, I coordinate the health there, which is an opportunity for people to get health screenings, consult with a doctor, or get vaccines while they’re waiting for their documents with the Mexican government to get processed,” Wolcott-MacCausland said. The program also helps people coordinate with their local health clinics and figure out health insurance, she noted.
After talking about her experience with the mobile Mexican consulate, Olga asked if she could say one more thing.
“I wanted to mention that as a community right now, we’re fighting against the detention of two of our leaders, Jose “Nacho” Ignacio De La Cruz and Heidi Perez, a father and stepdaughter. That’s something I want to make sure everyone’s aware of. And for my part, I’m a mother and I’m putting myself in the position of Heidi’s mother and Nacho’s partner who’s still here, free, but crying and heartbroken. It’s devastating.”
Olga said she is asking for community support to help free them and suggested visiting migrantjustice.net for updates and more information.

Nearly a quarter of the Gila National Forest could lose protections from logging and road construction if the United States Department of Agriculture repeals the 2001 ""Roadless Rule,"" which Secretary Brooke Rollins announced this week the agency intended to do. (Photo Courtesy Gila NF)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ announcement June 23 in Santa Fe that her agency is seeking to repeal the “Roadless Rule” has drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups in New Mexico and across the country. 
Nixing the rule means 58 million acres of land across the country could lose protections from road construction and logging the areas have enjoyed since 2001. Environmental groups, including New Mexico Wild, have said stripping the protections could spell the end of some of the last wild places in America. 
“This will cause immense damage to public lands, drinking water, and wildlife, and also threatens to increase wildfires,” a Climate Forests Campaign, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a joint statement Tuesday. 
A news release from New Mexico Wild notes that the Forest Service received 1.6 million comments in favor of the “Roadless Rule” when the agency was considering it more than 20 years ago, “more comments than any other rule in the nation’s history.”
About 1.6 million acres, or about 2,500 square miles, in national forests in New Mexico are currently protected. 
USDA Secretary in Santa Fe announces agency intends to repeal Clinton-era ‘roadless’ rule

A Source New Mexico review of Forest Service data shows that the Gila National Forest, one of five national forests in the state, could lose the most protected land to roads and other development. 
More than 730,000 acres of the Gila’s 3.3 million acres of land is currently protected, though about 45,000 acres of it does allow roads to be built or rebuilt under certain circumstances, according to a Source New Mexico review. The Gila National Wilderness recently celebrated its 100th anniversary. 
Rollins, in her speech Monday at the Western Governors’ Association meeting, touted the repeal as a way to protect forests against wildfires and also to put more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests. 
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests,” she said.
Environmental groups have pushed back against Rollins’ claim that the repeal could reduce the risk of wildfire. New Mexico Wild’s statement Tuesday said “human-caused fire ignitions are far more likely in roaded landscapes.”
Since Monday, the USDA website about the “Roadless Rule” has now been updated with next steps about what repeal will look like, including an environmental analysis; consultation with tribes and affected states; and compliance with the Endangered Species Act. 
“More information will be released as the rescission process gets underway,” the website says.

Vermont State Police have identified the man who drowned Tuesday in Lake Champlain as Darren Kemp, who was originally from South Africa. 
Kemp, 30, lived and worked at Basin Harbor Club, which spans parts of Vergennes and Ferrisburgh. On Tuesday, Kemp swam in Lake Champlain near the club, but did not emerge from under the waters, according to a police press release. 
State Police received word of the drowning incident around 9:25 p.m. and reported to the scene along with the Vergennes Area Rescue Squad and the Addison, Charlotte, Ferrisburgh and Vergennes fire departments. First responders carried Kemp from the waters to shore, but efforts to revive him were not successful.

Kemp was pronounced dead at approximately 10:10 p.m, and the Chief’s Examiner’s Office in Burlington will perform an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of death. There is no evidence the drowning death is suspicious, according to police.
This is the second reported drowning in the state in the span of a week, after an 18-year old Burlington High School student Eljak Menjwak died in the New Haven River in Bristol on Saturday. 
Like other states in the East, Vermont has been hit with extreme heat, humidity and thunderstorms this past week, leading many people to seek relief in or near bodies of water.
The state’s Department of Health has identified more than 400 cooling centers where Vermonters can seek shelter from heat waves this summer.

Gillett said texts on her personal phone were set to delete after 30 days.,"Criticism of Connecticut’s top utilities regulator ratcheted up again this week, after it was revealed in court that she had deleted text messages being sought by a pair of gas utilities in an ongoing lawsuit challenging last year’s cuts to gas rates.
During a hearing in that case Monday, an attorney for Public Utilities Regulatory Authority Chair Marissa Gillett said text messages on the chair’s personal cell phone were set to automatically delete after 30 days. Among the messages that were deleted, the attorney said, were texts with a state lawmaker who had penned an op-ed in the Connecticut Mirror harshly criticizing the state’s two largest utilities: Eversource and United Illuminating’s parent company, Avangrid.
The admission was first reported by the Hartford Courant, and immediately prompted a fresh round of rebukes from lawmakers. 
“I think this was a part of a systematic process of not being transparent,” said House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, who called for Gillett to resign. “It speaks to a lot of the problems that have come out of that agency.”
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he would like the legislature’s newly-created Government Oversight Committee to look into the matter. “I think we need more answers,” he said.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, expressed exasperation over the controversy, saying that he’s advised lawmakers in the past to avoid discussing public business on their personal devices. 
“This is the danger when you do this, you don’t have the same software and functions,” to ensure messages are properly archived, Ritter said. “I would be concerned if it were anybody, not just her.”
Representatives for Gillett and PURA did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Wednesday. 
Gillett, who has led PURA since 2019, survived a tough renomination battle earlier this year in which many Republicans questioned her leadership style as well as the state’s persistently high cost of electricity. Lawmakers ultimately voted to confirm her appointment to a second, four-year term at PURA, though her tenure as chair is separately due to expire next month.
Gov. Ned Lamont has yet to say whether or not he will reappoint Gillett as chair, though he defended her Wednesday when asked about calls for her to step aside.
“It’s a little ironic that the person who is most likely to hold Eversource accountable, which is Marissa Gillett, and do everything she can to protect the consumer in terms of pricing, is the same person that they want out of there and replaced with another retired legislator,” Lamont said.
When asked specifically if he had concerns about the deletion of her text messages, however, Lamont said he was not familiar with the controversy — or auto-deletion technology, in general.
“If we think there should be no auto-deletes allowed on any, you know, government phone, we should make that a rule,” he said. 
Government employees are required to abide by retention schedules for public records set for each state agency, including work-related communications on their public and private cell phones.
“We generally discourage the use of personal devices, because it can get complicated, switching back and forth,” said Colleen Murphy, the executive director of the Connecticut Freedom of Information Coalition.
The op-ed in question has become a key point of contention in a lawsuit by two of Avangrid’s gas utilities challenging the regulator’s decision last year to cut gas rates. The piece, titled “Don’t believe the utility company propaganda,” was published on Dec. 19 under the names of the two co-chairs of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee: state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex and state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport.
In February, the Courant published text messages from Steinberg obtained through a public records requests in which Gillett promised to send him a “draft” several days before the op-ed was published. Steinberg responded that he “should be available to review release/op Ed.”
Soon after that story was published, Avangrid’s attorneys sought additional information about the drafting of the op-ed through legal discovery, arguing that its authors showed a clear bias against the company. If Gillett played a role in drafting the piece, they argued, she should have been prevented from participating in the case that ultimately resulted in PURA slashing the utility’s gas rates by $35 million.
Both Gillett and the two lawmakers have repeatedly denied that she had a role in writing the piece. Attorneys for PURA have argued that word “draft” in her message referred to a piece of proposed legislation.
“I have said emphatically I never discussed any aspect of this editorial with her ever, other than to say after the fact that we got a good response,” Steinberg said Wednesday.
Asked whether, in hindsight, the preservation of Gillett’s texts would have avoided such a dispute, however, Steinberg said he agreed. “A lot of these things that are being alleged, at the time seemed pretty innocuous,” he said.
In a series of increasingly accusatory legal filings over the last several months, attorneys for the utilities and PURA have fought over the release of additional records, including the “draft” referenced in Gillett’s text. 
In one brief filed on June 6, Assistant Attorney General Seth Hollander, who is representing PURA, said both Gillett and her chief of staff, Theresa Govert, had reviewed their work and personal phones and not found any relevant messages concerning the op-ed. 
When pressed about the matter by Superior Court Judge Matthew Budzik on Monday, however, Hollander conceded that Gillett’s messages with Steinberg had been subject to the auto-delete function on her phone, and that efforts to restore them from backup were unsuccessful.
“With respect to this conversation that took place on two different days, on that personal cell phone, those are not retrievable,” Hollander said, according to an official transcript of the hearing. 
On Wednesday, Budzik issued an order allowing Avangrid’s attorneys to depose both Gillett and Govert within the next two weeks to determine the extent to which either “may have reviewed and/or commented upon the December 19th op-ed.” Attorneys will also be allowed to ask about the deletion of any documents subject to the judge’s previous discovery order. 
A copy of the judge’s order, which was not immediately available online Wednesday, was provided to the Connecticut Mirror by Avangrid.
Representatives for both Avangrid and the attorney general’s office declined to comment publicly on the case Wednesday, instead referring to the court record.
“We need to get to the bottom of this,” John Cerreta, an attorney for the utilities, said during the hearing Monday, according to the transcript. “We need to find out whether these responsive documents exist, what they are, whether they’ve been deleted, and whether they can be recovered.”
The escalation of the dispute between PURA and Avangrid came this week as Wall Street credit-rating agency Moody’s downgraded the rating of the state’s largest electric utility, Eversource, citing Connecticut’s “least credit supportive utility regulatory environment in the US.”
Executives at both Eversource and Avangrid have repeatedly complained that regulators’ decisions in Connecticut have stifled their ability to access credit necessary to make investments in energy and gas infrastructure across the state.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee is scaling back his controversial proposal to sell off public land around the West.
According to a new version of the bill obtained Wednesday by Politico, Lee still intends on selling off parcels of public land — but there are several new guardrails in place, after the original proposal received widespread backlash and was deemed in violation of Senate rules by the body’s parliamentarian. 
Notably, U.S. Forest Service land is no longer eligible for sale, and the bill language states that only Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, land will be disposed of. 
The BLM will be required to dispose of between 0.25% to 0.5% of its land — previously the requirement was for 0.5% to 0.75% of land. And the bill states only parcels within five miles of the “border of a population center” will be eligible. 
That means the BLM would be required to sell between 612,500 to 1.225 million acres in 11 Western states — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Montana remains exempt.

Here are other major takeaways from Lee’s latest proposal: 

Nominating a parcel for sale would require a description of how development of the land would “address local housing needs (including housing supply and affordability) or any infrastructure and amenities to support local needs associated with housing.” 
The bill also states that any land that’s sold “shall be used solely for the development of housing or to address any infrastructure and amenities to support local needs associated with housing.”
The secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior must consult the governor of the state where the land is located, and any local governments or tribes, “regarding the suitability of the area for residential development.” 
Land that’s nominated by state or local governments that is adjacent to “developed areas,” has access to existing infrastructure and is “suitable for residential housing” would be prioritized. 
Sales that reduce “checkerboard” landscapes — the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice-versa — and federal land that’s isolated and difficult to manage would also be prioritized. 
The land would be disposed of by “competitive sale, auction, or other methods” to ensure it’s sold at fair market value. 
Land that has a grazing permit or “valid existing right,” which includes an oil and gas lease or mining claim, is exempt. 
According to the bill, 5% of the proceeds from any sale will go toward local governments. 
An additional 10% of proceeds will go toward “hunting, fishing, and recreational amenities” and the deferred maintenance backlog for BLM land in the state where the land is sold.
The bill allocates $5 million to hire appraisers, solicit nominations for land sale and other related duties. 
Anything “federally protected” is excluded — that includes a national monument, park, conservation area, wilderness preserve, seashore, historic site, memorial, historic park or recreation area. 
The bill expires in 2034.  

Lee’s original proposal received widespread criticism from Democrat and Republican politicians, as well as environmental, veteran, hunting and fishing groups. 
It would have required the U.S. Forest Service and BLM to sell between 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres in the West, and the bill’s definitions meant that more than 258 million acres would be eligible for sale, including 18.7 million acres in Utah.



Let us know what you think...


 


But on Monday, Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough said Lee’s proposal violated Senate reconciliation rules, meaning it would require more than a simple majority to pass. That same day, Lee signaled he would make changes to the bill. 
“I’m still listening,” he wrote on social media Tuesday. “I’m working closely with the Trump administration to ensure that any federal land sales serve the American people — not foreign governments, not the Chinese Communist Party, and not massive corporations looking to pad their portfolios. This land must go to American families. Period.” 
But environmental and public land advocacy groups are still doubtful. The group Center for Western Priorities identified a number of recreation spots that would still be eligible for sale under Lee’s proposal — among them are the Sand Flats Recreation Area, the Portal Trail, parts of Poison Spider Mesa, Millcreek Canyon and the Moab Rim Trail, all located near Moab. 
“Sen. Lee’s legislation is still the largest sell-off of public lands in U.S. history,” said Laiken Jordahl with the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement Wednesday. “It still leaves millions of acres of cherished public lands at risk of being lost forever to the ultra rich and destructive sprawl developments, including near Arches and Zion national parks. It’s still overwhelmingly out of step with the values of Americans everywhere.”

In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Tana Lin in Washington partially issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Trump administration to release funds that it withheld this winter. But the judge denied Vermont’s claims, deciding the state didn’t prove it would face “irreparable harm” if funds were left on hold. 
Some clean energy advocates in Vermont think the hold is harmful. 
“Americans in rural parts of the country — blue, red and purple — are worse off because these funds are not out the door,” said Ben Edgerly Walsh, Climate and Energy Program director for Vermont Public Interest Research Group. 
And now the state will have to keep fighting if it wants change.

“The Attorney General is very disappointed with this outcome and will continue to explore legal options to protect Vermont’s interests and funding in this case,” said Amelia Vath, a spokesperson for the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, over email. 
In February, the Trump administration, through the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration, withheld billions of dollars allocated by Congress to build out electric vehicle chargers in many states. In response, Vermont filed the lawsuit, along with 15 other states and Washington, D.C., in May against those two offices.
In the suit, the states bit back, claiming that both entities overstepped their authority by trying to interfere with funding that was designated by Congress. 
Before funds were put on hold, Vermont was set to receive $16.7 million in federal funding for charging projects across three years, according to court documents. 
Based on that award, the state originally planned to pay a total of $9.3 million to different contractors who would build out charging stations around the state. Now, without federal funding, “Vermont cannot fund all of the projects,” it claimed in court. 
“It’s absurd that the Trump administration is tying the law into knots in order to keep this money out of Vermont and these other states,” Walsh said. 
While Vermont has more charging ports per-capita than most states, it still has a long way to come, Walsh said. When more charging stations are publicly available, it’s more viable for renters and low-income Vermonters to own electric vehicles, he said. 
In court, Vermont, Minnesota and Washington, D.C., didn’t submit documents proving federal approval and reapproval of their state plans, according to court documents. The three were the only jurisdictions denied funding in the judge’s ruling.

Utah senator trims plans, calling targeted BLM land “unused,” “mismanaged” and “only appropriate for housing.”
The post As Wyoming protests, public land sell-off ‘just getting started’ appeared first on WyoFile .","In the face of a backlash, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee has revamped his public land sell-off measure to target only Bureau of Land Management holdings while also declaring, “we’re just getting started.”
A reconciliation budget proposal revised by Lee’s Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee targets BLM land within five miles of undefined “population centers.” It puts checkerboard BLM holdings back on a priority list for his “mandatory disposal” measure and takes lands under permit for grazing off the auction block.
The revision would shift 15% of revenue to local governments and conservation. The bill would appropriate $5 million to carry out the mandatory sales, which are designed to be offered within 60 days of passage and regularly thereafter.
Lee has not said or mapped how much land must be sold, ostensibly for affordable housing.
“Folks like Elon Musk …  will make money off the public lands that should belong to the American people. That’s horseshit.” Martin Heinrich
“We haven’t put out maps because there are a whole bunch of criteria established by the legislation, and those criteria are very difficult to reduce to a map,” Lee told conservative radio host Charlie Kirk in a video posted on X.
But opposition to Lee’s measure comes from “all walks of life,” said Land Tawney, former president and CEO of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. That includes “Democrats, Independents, Republicans, hunters, anglers, bird watchers, kayakers, ranchers [and] loggers,” he said Wednesday at a roundtable hosted by Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.
Heinrich excoriated Lee’s measure.
“Eighty-five percent of the money from these sales would go to pay for tax cuts,” Heinrich said. “That means that folks like Elon Musk, who already own[s] 4,400 acres of land in Texas [worth] some $3.4 billion, will make money off the public lands that should belong to the American people.
“That’s horseshit,” Heinrich said.
A spectrum of opposition
Lee’s plan to include U.S. Forest Service land in the “mandatory disposal” provision flunked a parliamentarian’s rules test that limits reconciliation budget measures to relevant budget matters. The revised provision must undergo the same scrutiny, Democrats say.
Heinrich poo-pooed the notion that Lee’s measure would result in affordable housing. “An out-of-town billionaire can show up, buy a 100-acre parcel and throw a trophy home on it,” he said.
Powell resident Mike Tracy criticized Lee’s linking of public land and affordable housing.
“If you put those two concepts in the same sentence,” he said of Lee’s proposal, “it makes them seem somehow related, maybe even somehow causal.
“It makes people not feel comfortable speaking out against it because who wants to be against affordable housing?” he said at the roundtable. “I don’t think it’s proper to say that they’re related.”
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, had a message for Lee. “Don’t come into our states and dictate what should be done.
“It is clear they’re trying to sell this public land to pay for this reconciliation package, which gives tax cuts to billionaires,” she said. “That’s what this is about.”
“Right now, we are pissed,” said hunting advocate Tawney, who represented American Hunters and Anglers. “They want to defund, dismantle and then divest,” he said of President Donald Trump’s administration.
Native American tribes are upset, too, said Hilary Tompkins, former solicitor for the Department of the Interior.
“The Southern Ute Indian tribe in southwestern Colorado is concerned because they have off-reservation hunting and fishing rights on an area that includes BLM lands,” she said. “They have not heard from anyone who is advocating for this proposal about the impact on those off-reservation treaty rights.”
Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon sees opportunities to resolve the state’s challenges with the checkerboard land ownership pattern along the Union Pacific Railroad line, said Jess Johnson, government affairs director with the Wyoming Wildlife Federation.
“I want to figure out how we do this in a Wyoming way,” she said of the checkerboard conundrum. “This budget reconciliation is not it.”
Not sensitive lands?
Wyoming’s U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, Republicans who continue to support Trump’s agenda, did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment about the backlash. “It is clear that our congressional delegation isn’t in it for Wyoming,” the state’s Democratic Party chair, Lucas Fralick, said in a statement.
Lee, however, explained some of his thinking.
“I’m working closely with the Trump administration to ensure that any federal land sales serve the American people — not foreign governments, not the Chinese Communist Party, and not massive corporations looking to pad their portfolios,” he said in a post. “This land must go to American families. Period.”
In the radio interview, he said opposition was ginned up.
“The left is working overtime to dupe conservatives about my federal land sale bill,” he said. “This is just basically surplus land that’s suitable for housing because it’s right next to where people live.”
He characterized critics as having an agenda. “What I’ve heard is that people on the left generally want people moving from rural areas into urban areas, more suburban areas and from single-family housing into multi-family housing, higher density housing units,” he said. “They believe that that’s good for them, perhaps for Mother Earth, or whatever their reasons might be.
“These are not sensitive lands,” Lee said of the targeted BLM parcels. “They are not lands that are out there, that are part of an environment that’s appropriate for hunting, for hiking, for fishing, etc.”
Wyoming’s Johnson challenged that notion at the roundtable. She said she arrowed her first mule deer on public land near town.
“I was on this amazing parcel of public land — tiny,” she said. “It’s little. It’s one to three miles from Lander. It’s BLM. It’s really nothing special to look at, except it is everything to me.”

(Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Democratic leaders rallied Wednesday against the congressional budget and tax cut bill, fearing changes to the national food assistance program will blow holes in state budgets and leave Americans hungry.
Four Democratic governors and two U.S. senators slammed the proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which they referred to as “ugly” and a “big beautiful betrayal of a bill” during a press call.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota led the call. She and U.S. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, as well as Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Laura Kelly of Kansas and Matt Meyer of Delaware took turns lambasting the Republican legislation.
“I’m very concerned about not only the money that this is going to cost but also the chaos that it’s going to create for so many people who will just give up and end up going hungry,” Kelly said.
The Democrats told stories of seniors, children, veterans and families who they worry will suffer as a result of cuts.
“They’re going to have that pain in their stomachs and throughout their body when they’re trying to go to bed or when they’re waking up in the morning of not having enough to eat,” Beshear said.
The bill changes by the day. Recent modifications from the U.S. Senate would require states to contribute a combined $128 billion to the federal food assistance program, which historically has been fully funded by the federal government. States would be required to contribute more money, the higher their payment error rates. States currently contribute half of administrative costs, but another provision in the bill seeks to reduce the federal government’s share by $27 billion, or 25%, creating additional costs for states.
The changes to SNAP from the Senate are multifold, but many are driven by cost-cutting measures and restricting eligibility.
The current proposal would bolster work requirements for SNAP beneficiaries and restrict eligibility for people in the U.S. without permanent legal status. Both provisions are designed to save the government almost $100 billion by making benefits more difficult to access for low-income families. The proposal also could eliminate internet expenses from utility benefit calculations, reducing the amount of money beneficiaries receive each month. That change is expected to save the government $11 billion.
The Democrats criticized Republicans for touting the bill as cutting costs while it is projected to add $3 trillion to the country’s deficit in the next decade.
Two of the bill’s food-benefits provisions — the state contribution requirement and restricted eligibility for immigrants who aren’t lawful permanent residents of the U.S. — broke a Senate rule, according to the budget committee. Those provisions either need to be fixed or, if left in, will be subject to a 60-vote threshold.
“That has not deterred the Republican leadership from continuing to search for workarounds, and apparently have found one,” said Kelly.
Republicans recently adjusted the language of the state contribution provision, and the Senate parliamentarian took it under review
Klobuchar, who sits on the Senate rules and agriculture committees, anticipated word on whether the new language violates a Senate rule by Thursday. Regardless, she said, Democrats intend to oppose the bill.
Most of the bill’s funding is a result of shifting costs in the billions to states, she said.
The majority of states have balanced budget rules, Klobuchar said, “so they would be forced to choose: pay for food assistance or reduce law enforcement, reduce education or reduce health care.”
Klobuchar quoted a letter Democratic governors sent Tuesday to congressional leadership, explaining their qualms with states taking on SNAP costs.
“These cuts from Congress don’t just increase state costs,” the letter said, “they make it nearly impossible for states to effectively plan for these long-term budget impacts.”
Most states have already finalized budgets ahead of the June 30 end date of the 2025 fiscal year.
Klobuchar said 4 million Americans will lose SNAP benefits as a result of the bill, which includes 1 million seniors, 800,000 parents with school-age children and 1.4 million people who live in areas where finding a job is difficult.
SNAP beneficiaries receive about $6.20 per person per day. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to more than 42 million people across the country. Around 115,000 Delawareans, 186,000 Kansans, 700,000 Kentuckians, 1.1 million Massachusetts residents and 360,000 Minnesotans receive monthly SNAP benefits as of March, according to preliminary estimates from the USDA.
Healey, of Massachusetts, said that for every one meal that a food bank provides, SNAP provides nine.
States don’t have the resources to fill gaps left behind by the proposed cuts, she said.
Kelly estimated Kansas, in administrative costs alone, will have to find more than $15 million per year to operate SNAP, which she called a conservative estimate. She expected Kansans in need will lose their benefits, especially if bolstered work requirements pass. She said they sound “really good” in theory, but worried the requirements and reporting will create hurdles for people who are “legitimately qualified” for benefits.
“We’re going to see the same thing happen with SNAP that we saw with Medicaid in states that were forced to, or did, put in work requirements,” she said.
Beshear drew a connection between the bill’s SNAP provisions and similar cuts that would weaken funding to rural hospitals. Kentucky has the highest number in the nation of rural hospitals at risk, with 35 facing closure. Beshear said those hospitals are often major employers. If rural hospitals close as a result of the bill, he said, Kentuckians are more likely to fall on hard times and turn to assistance programs like SNAP for help. But the proposed cuts to SNAP will make that more difficult, he said. Beshear criticized the cuts through the lens of religion, reciting the biblical story of the loaves and fishes.
“In a country where we grow enough food so that no one has to go hungry,” he said, “no one should go hungry.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/klobuchar-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 19:08:34.847561

Kelly Armstrong, left, talks to Tyler Pfaff while surveying what is left of his family's rural Enderlin home on June 25, 2025. (Photo provided by governor's office)ENDERLIN – North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong praised the cleanup efforts of communities struck by last week’s storms while promising the state would provide resources to help them rebuild.
He toured the communities of Enderlin, Page and Hunter on Wednesday, hearing about recovery efforts from community leaders, first responders and victims.
“There’s a long road ahead,” Armstrong said. “But a lot of work has already been done. I’m amazed at how quickly North Dakotans help their neighbors. 


How to help
The North Dakota Community Foundation has set up a storm relief fund. Financial donations will be provided to impacted communities and homeowners to assist with disaster recovery and unmet needs.


Armstrong declared a statewide disaster Saturday and activated the State Emergency Operations Plan after multiple tornadoes, strong winds and hail caused widespread damage across the state Friday.
The storm also claimed four lives. The latest confirmed is a 76-year-old man in the Courtenay area who was found dead on Saturday, according to Stutsman County Emergency Manager Jessica Moser. The man used a breathing apparatus and his home was among those that lost power, Moser said. His name was not immediately released.
Three people died in the Enderlin tornado, Michael Dehn, 73, Katherine Pfaff-Dehn, 73, and Marcario Lucio, 89, according to the Cass County Sheriff’s Office.
After seeing the damage, Armstrong said it was miraculous there weren’t more deaths and injuries. 
One home he toured belonged to Tyler and Brooke Pfaff of rural Enderlin. Originally built into a hillside, all that remained were some rock walls and shattered windows. The couple huddled in an interior bathroom when the tornado struck.
“It’s a total loss, but thank God we’re alive,” Tyler Pfaff said as he looked over what used to be his living room, now filled with debris and shredded insulation. “I’m not sure where we go from here.”
Over the past few days, neighbors and other volunteers had cleaned up snapped trees on the property and recovered personal items. 
“I’m overwhelmed,” Pfaff said. “People were here right away.”
Armstrong said neighborly kindness is a tremendous resource in times of disaster. “Nothing replaces our capacity to care for each other,” he said.

Enderlin Sheldon Fire Department Chief Jon Anderson said around 10 homes were destroyed or severely damaged in the storm’s path.
Much of the damage caused by storms will be covered by private insurance, but it could take a while to assess the claims, Armstrong said. One way the state may help is by offering grants or loans so individuals and communities can begin to rebuild immediately instead of waiting, he said.
The Industrial Commission meets Thursday morning and resources for storm relief will be a dominant topic, Armstrong said. In addition, Armstrong said he will ask for federal assistance, though the timing for making that request is uncertain.
“Our job is to help these communities get back on their feet,” he said.
In Page, one home was destroyed, according to Mayor Jim Heidorn. Other homes sustained damage to roofs, windows and trees. 
Outside of the city limits, many farms also lost grain storage.
Stephen and Scott Thompson, twin brothers who farm near Page, were cleaning the farm site with their families when Armstrong arrived to survey the damage. They lost grain bins that hold 450,000 bushels of corn. In addition, they couldn’t access bins holding about 100,000 bushels of grain because of the damage.
Stephen Thompson and his family were home when a series of storms hit overnight Friday. The third wave of wind hit them hardest, Thompson said.
“We ran into our (walk-out) basement and saw a 40-foot tree fall on our patio,” he said. For 45 minutes, the house shook from the wind.

Scott Thompson said it would take at least five years to rebuild, but there was no question the family would. A 100-year-old barn sustained damage in the storms and was leaning.
“We’ve straightened that more than once,” said Stephen Thompson. “And we’ll straighten it again. We’ve already tried today.”
Luke Erickson is part owner of EEE, which designs and builds grain storage in the region. He accompanied Armstrong on part of the tour around Page. Many of the farms affected were his customers, friends or family.
“It’s tough to fathom the damage,” he said. Grain bins could be replaced before harvest, but orders would need to be put in immediately, he said. 
Jim Kaiser, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service of Grand Forks, said there were 13 confirmed tornadoes in North Dakota Friday and Saturday. Six of those are rated with the highest at an EF3; the others are still being investigated.
In addition to the tornadoes, the storms brought sustained winds and wind gusts of up to 100 mph, Kaiser said. “That’s why you see so much damage,” he said. “That’s why we call it a ‘generational storm.’”

Three people linked to a group known as the Zizians are facing new felony charges related to firearms and illegal drug trafficking, on top of the misdemeanors that have kept them jailed in Maryland since February.
Members of the Zizians have been tied to violence in several states, including the fatal January shooting of a border patrol agent in northern Vermont.
The charges were filed last week against the three suspects who are named in court documents as Jack Amadeus LaSota, Michelle Jacqueline Zajko and Daniel Arthur Blank and who had previously been charged in Maryland with several misdemeanors each. 
Those charges, including the unlawful possession of handguns, trespassing and obstructing arrest, stemmed from their arrest in Frostburg, Maryland, in February while allegedly camping on private property. 
Now, prosecutors in Maryland’s Allegany County have brought a new indictment against each of them.
The new charges include felony counts of narcotic possession with intent to distribute and drug trafficking with the use of a firearm, according to court records and an article Wednesday in the Cumberland Times-News in Maryland. 
The penalties for the latest felony charges, if they lead to convictions, carry up to 20 years in prison. 
Prosecutors and attorneys for the three defendants could not be reached Wednesday afternoon for comment.
LaSota, Zajko and Blank have been in custody in Maryland since their initial arrest in February while the cases against them have been pending. 
Zajko and LaSota have also been previously charged with federal offenses as has one other person linked to the Zizians in Vermont.
In the Vermont case, two people named in court records as Felix Bauckholt and Teresa Youngblut were pulled over by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent David Maland on Jan. 20 on Interstate 91 in Coventry.
Youngblut, according to court records, opened fire, leading to a shootout that left Maland and Bauckholt dead and Youngblut injured.
Youngblut, 21, of Washington state, faces federal firearms and assault charges but has not been charged directly with killing Maland. At a court hearing Tuesday in Youngblut’s case in Burlington, a defense attorney stated he expected federal prosecutors to file new charges against his client in “short order” that carry the possibility of the death penalty.
Authorities have alleged that the guns that Youngblut and Bauckholt had at the time of the traffic stop in Vermont had been purchased by Zajko, who had lived for a time in Coventry.
Zajko has since been charged with a federal offense related to the purchases of firearms in Vermont. Zajko has not appeared in court in Vermont to face that charge.
LaSota, the alleged leader of the Zizians who blogged under the name “Ziz,” was federally indicted last week in Maryland on a charge of being an armed fugitive.
VTDigger is using Youngblut, LaSota and Bauckholt’s names and pronouns as they appear in court documents. While they have appeared to use other names in some instances, VTDigger has not been able to confirm which name each person uses in their day-to-day lives or their gender identities.
Authorities have linked the Zizians to other killings, including the January death of a landlord in Vallejo, California, and the 2022 fatal shootings of Zajko’s parents in Pennsylvania. None of the three Maryland defendants have been charged with any of the killings.

Bernie Sanders clasp hands before the crowd in Concord, New Hampshire. (Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said her agency will look into whether the Caddo Parish Commission violated state law when it touted a visit from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders to Shreveport last weekend.
Nearly 2,000 people showed up Saturday at the Shreveport Municipal Auditorium for Sanders’ appearance as part of his “Fighting Oligarcy” tour, KSLA-TV reported. The progressive senator from Vermont stopped in Northwest Louisiana to lay his criticism for the Trump administration at the doorstep of U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Shreveport, whose district includes the area. 
Ahead of Sanders’ visit, the Caddo Parish Commission approved a resolution welcoming the senator to the area. Murrill argues that because the commission’s agenda for the meeting did not include the resolution, it is potentially a violation of the state’s Open Meetings Law. The statute calls for all business to be conducted at a meeting to be placed on a publicly available agenda 24 hours before its members convene.
Agendas posted online for recent commission meetings do not list a resolution regarding Sanders.
“If members of the Caddo Commission want to act as a body (including issuing official documents in the name of the Commission welcoming socialist Bernie Sanders to Shreveport), they are legally required to put it in the agenda at a properly held public meeting,” Murrill wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday afternoon. 
Caddo Parish Commission Chairman J.P. Young did not respond to a message and email seeking comment. Krystle Beauchamp, communications director for Caddo Parish, confirmed the attorney general has notified the commission about its investigation. She referred additional questions to Murrill’s office.

Just five months after being sworn in as president, Donald Trump has embroiled the U.S. in a shooting war in the  Middle East, a trade war with our allies and neighbors, and a culture war with those who oppose his policies. 
Trump has deployed the National Guard and the U.S. Marines into the streets of a major American city over the objections of a mayor and a governor, and unleashed masked agents to snatch unsuspecting immigrants off the streets and ship them off to foreign prisons. 
This seemed like a good moment to check in with Rep. Becca Balint. Balint, D-Vt., was elected to Congress from Vermont in 2022 and is a member of the House Judiciary Committee and the Budget Committee. She serves on the Congressional Progressive Caucus as Vice Chair for New Members and as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus. 
She spoke to me on Tuesday, June 24, from her congressional office in Washington D.C.

David Goodman  
I checked the temperature in Washington, D.C., and it is 100 degrees outside. I’m wondering if it’s even hotter inside the building where you are.
Rep. Becca Balint  
It’s pretty hot. Members on my side of the aisle are furious. You had the Trump administration bomb Iran over the weekend, and we still have not received a members’ briefing on it. Members of the House were supposed to have a classified briefing this afternoon but that was just canceled by House Republican leadership. Not only did the President not come to us ahead of the attack, but he also iced out any Democratic members on the intelligence committees and the committees that deal with national security. He has surrounded himself with yes men and even his own people that he’s appointed to advise him on intelligence and national security, he did not listen to them ahead of this. So there is a lot of anger, but also generally fear about the future. 
When you have a president who is extremely emotional, seems to make decisions on a whim and does not ask for any kind of deep analysis ahead of the decision making – so yeah, things feel pretty hot and pretty tense right now. 
David Goodman  
What is your response to the US bombing of Iran?
Rep. Becca Balint  
I think it was the absolute wrong thing to do. We never should have walked away from the Iran nuclear deal. We have to continue with diplomacy. I feel like, in this moment, it seems pretty clear to me that our president is not only being played by Vladimir Putin, but he’s also being played by Benjamin Netanyahu. 
David Goodman  
Explain how this plays into Netanyahu’s interests.
Rep. Becca Balint  
This is what Netanyahu has wanted for years, to have an American president intervene in Israel’s longstanding conflict with Iran. And Americans have said repeatedly, they want no more wars. They want us to pursue a path of peace. And that was a campaign promise that the President made as well, right? He said if you elect Harris-Walz, you’re going to be involved in a war within six months of office, right? This is not only exactly what Benjamin Netanyahu wanted for his own political survival, but also to give him breathing room on Gaza, to enable him to take more power in Gaza and the West Bank. It is a way for (Netanyahu) to consolidate power and control. 
I don’t feel that this President plays chess. I feel like he makes decisions based on the whim at the moment and who is flattering him, and who is making promises to him or where he thinks he is going to get that feeling that he craves. This is a man who craves people praising him, and that is no way for us to be making foreign policy decisions.
David Goodman  
One commentator wrote that your feelings about the attack on Iran either fall into one of two categories: one, that you think this is the end of a war, or two, that you think this is the start of a war. Which do you think it is?
Rep. Becca Balint  
Interesting framing. I am highly skeptical of any information that we are getting from this administration, and so I have said in the last 36 hours that there’s a lot that’s happening right now that feels very similar to what happened in the lead up to the invasion of Iraq. You had in this situation of President (Bush) saying this was imminent, that the uranium that was being enriched was going to be used in a nuclear weapon against Israel. It was going to threaten the world. And then you had people within his own administration saying it wasn’t imminent, that actually the intelligence didn’t show that. It’s difficult, if we’re not getting any kind of information from this administration, for us to make an educated decision about what should happen here. Time will tell whether this is the end of the tensions. I have a hard time believing that that’s the case, and we’ll see if this ceasefire holds. 
You’ve got a president who, seemingly on a whim, tweets that we have a cease fire between Israel and and Iran and next thing you know, they’re bombing each other and they say that we never agreed to a cease fire. So what is actually happening here? We would like the opportunity to ask this administration directly, as that is our job as Congress to be serving in a position of oversight.
David Goodman  
You signed on to a resolution calling for the War Powers Act to be invoked. Explain what that is and what Congress’s role is in these situations, and why you think that’s warranted. 
Rep. Becca Balint  
Congress has the authority to declare war and to commit offensive force and troops. That is within our purview, that is not within the purview of the executive branch, which I know is confusing for some people, because you have the president as commander in chief. But it makes sense, too, if you’re committing resources, where do you go to commit resources? You have to come to Congress. Congress makes those decisions. And after Vietnam happened, and obviously years and years of the American people and Congress feeling like they had been quite rightly lied to by numerous administrations about how the war was going, there was a strengthening of congressional power through the War Powers Act in the 1970s. 
Thomas Massie, who’s a Republican from Kentucky, has put forward a bipartisan agreement to demand that the President comes to us to get that authority to declare or to engage in war with Iran. And obviously that hasn’t happened, but many of us were relieved that Thomas Massie has been a strong voice on these issues his entire career in Congress. We disagree on a lot of things, but as you know, politics makes strange bedfellows, and I was very happy to sign onto his bill.
David Goodman  
Let’s turn from violence abroad to violence at home. The murder of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and the shooting of another Minnesota lawmaker put a spotlight on rising political violence. And earlier this spring, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) stated publicly how afraid she was. She said “I am oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice because retaliation is real.” I wanted to get your thoughts on this and also ask, have you felt threatened in any way?
Rep. Becca Balint  
I think every single member of Congress feels threatened, feels in danger. We have all lost a sense that we can navigate this job without experiencing some kind of a dangerous situation, either for ourselves or our families, every time that we are asked to be at an event in Vermont and elsewhere too. In Vermont, my team, the first thing they need to do is they need to go over a safety plan with me. They need to call local law enforcement. I need to know exactly where the car is going to be. How are we going to get out of the building? Who is going to be my go-to? This is happening in every single district.
We do not have security details as member of Congress. I was in a huddle with members this morning as we talked about heading out for the Fourth of July parades that we’re all going to be doing, and that you can’t have a security plan for a parade. We were talking for the first time like, is this the year we all start wearing bulletproof vests? This is not what it’s supposed to be like to represent your constituents. You should not fear for your life. You should not feel fear for the safety of your family. 
David Goodman  
What do you attribute the rise in political violence too.
Rep. Becca Balint  
I think a lot of it, not all of it, can be traced back to the kind of rhetoric that this President has used in both of his campaigns. It has been dehumanizing. It’s been demonizing. It has been attacking viciously people that he doesn’t think belongs, whether it is immigrants or migrants, whether it is women, whether it is trans people. I mean, he is attacking viciously the LGBTQ community and it is picked up. He has broken the rules about what is acceptable discourse. Social media has always been a place where people felt that freedom. But it’s not just happening there. It’s happening in the halls of Congress. It’s happening in committees. It’s happening that constituents feel emboldened to say anything, do anything. This movement in which everything is acceptable isn’t going to go away when Trump is no longer president.
David Goodman  
A number of Democratic leaders have recently been arrested. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, New Jersey Representative Lamonica McIver, and of course Senator Alex Padilla of California, who was thrown to the ground and handcuffed for trying to ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a question. And then we saw New York City Comptroller Brad Lander manhandled and arrested. What is the through line that connects all of these instances of high profile arrests of these officials?
Rep. Becca Balint  
Silence and intimidation is the goal. It is to create a situation where if a member of Congress is being arrested, if a senator is being wrestled to the floor, if they will do that to a mayor, if they will do that to a comptroller, they will do that to anyone, and they are doing that to anyone. It is about intimidation and silence so that they will have no oversight over what they’re doing, and when we feel fear, when we feel intimidated, then we are not able to do our oversight, but also we won’t have collective action, right? People say to me, Is it safe for me to go out and protest? Is it safe for us to be seen together? I’ve especially gotten this question from people of color. Am I going to make myself a target? That’s what they want, and it’s going to take all of us to stand up to that, because they’re not going to stop until we say collectively No. And they can’t arrest all of us. They can’t.
David Goodman  
What should Democrats be doing right now to confront what’s going on? 
Rep. Becca Balint  
Well, a couple things. One, there’s a lot more happening than people see. Every single day in the house in every single committee, you have Democrats going toe to toe with Republicans who are trying to push the most outrageous legislation. And we need to be listening more than we’re talking. 
What’s happening is this administration is burning everything to the ground, and it is horrible. People are losing their jobs. There are resources that are not being invested in the NIH and research, there are attacks on Medicaid. These things are going to hurt people. And we also have to be thinking a few steps ahead, which is, where is the opportunity in that to not rebuild what we had before that didn’t feel like it was serving people. 
People want to see us fighting. They want us to see us showing up in difficult conversations and not backing down. I heard from Democrats across Vermont and across the country, they want to see us pushing the envelope more and using power when we have it and not being so timid.
David Goodman  
The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that states can restrict access to transgender care, and you delivered an impassioned speech in a House committee. You asked why, with all the problems that the country and the world are facing, there was this obsession among Republicans about trans kids. How do you answer that?
Rep. Becca Balint  
It was a strategic decision that was made by the Republican Party. This is no accident. They sat down with their strategists and they realized that they had sort of lost the battle on rights for gay Americans, and they were looking for a new enemy. And what they realized is that most Americans didn’t have a lot of knowledge about the lives of trans people, and it was a very easy target for them. This is a tiny percentage of the population. That is their answer to anything that we bring up in committee, trans people are to blame. Don’t focus on the fact that you can’t pay your bills, somehow the fact that trans people want health care, that’s to blame. Don’t focus on the fact that you’re being screwed over by tax policy, it’s the fact that you’ve got a 13-year-old trans girl who wants to play field hockey. It is a concerted effort to draw attention away to all the ways in which this administration is lawless, corrupt and not meeting the needs of individual people, and they’re preying on the this group because they’re trusting that most Americans don’t have a lot of experience talking about these issues, and it makes them uncomfortable, because they don’t feel like they know a lot about it. 
A reporter asked me, “Why do you think you have become sort of a champion in fighting for the rights of these individuals?” I said, for me, it comes down to every single individual having access to health care, period. And if nobody else is going to speak up, I’m going to speak up, because this is a basic core value for me. I don’t necessarily feel like I’m the best spokesperson for this. I am not a trans person. I haven’t had this experience. I don’t have a trans person in my family. But damn it, if someone’s coming for the rights of one of my constituents, are coming from their health care, I’m going to fight with everything I’ve got.
David Goodman  
One of the things that we’re supposed to be distracted from looking at is the budget reconciliation bill that is moving through Congress that includes some $800 billion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and health services. In Vermont, this may result in cutting or reducing food assistance for up to 13,000 Vermonters, and potentially result in hospital closures. Talk about this budget and its potential impact on Vermont. What aspects of it are you most concerned about? 
Rep. Becca Balint  
I was meeting with folks in healthcare from Vermont here in my office today and they’re deeply concerned that tens of thousands of Vermonters are going to lose their health care and that facilities will close. A lot of people don’t realize Medicaid is the margin that keeps open a lot of rural health care centers. This is the case that I made to my Republican colleagues on the Budget Committee. I said, it’s not just blue states. Your rural hospitals are going to close too. And many of them didn’t believe us, because I feel like their leadership was not honest with them about what was in there, and they were not curious enough to find out.
David Goodman  
President Trump’s mass deportation program has now come to Vermont. Farm workers are being rounded up. There have been high profile arrests in Vermont, such as the case of Mohsen Mahdawi. Now it appears that Trump is targeting states that do not support him or his deportation policies. What is your response to these developments and what can be done about it?
Rep. Becca Balint  
We always knew this wasn’t going to be about going after “criminals” or “the worst of the worst.” We knew that because you can’t implement a mass deportation program supposedly going after millions of criminals. He was going to have to go after people who were showing up at the Home Depot to buy tools to be able to go and do their jobs every day, or students — people here legally — swooping in on folks when they are just at their court appearances. These supposed criminals are showing up (in court) following the rules, and that’s when they’re being detained, arrested, in some cases, shipped off to other countries. 
(Podcaster) Joe Rogan, who was a huge Trump supporter, was questioning on his show, what are we doing here? We’re now going after people who are living here peacefully, they’re contributing to our communities — this doesn’t make sense. And so this is another situation where we have to be standing up together. We have an obligation as members of Congress to do oversight. And I think that those of us who saw this happening on the campaign trail, we knew exactly what was coming, because we know who Stephen Miller is. He is the mastermind of all of this. He would like to have a white country devoid of brown people. That’s what this is all about. This is about white supremacy.
David Goodman  
You ran in your last race centering your own personal story about your family being Holocaust survivors. I wonder if you could take the temperature on the state of our democracy right now. What is it? Where are we?
Rep. Becca Balint  
If you’re only looking at what this administration is doing, what you see is a very bleak story. You see a president who is exceeding his authority and his power. You see him testing the judicial branch and trying to run roughshod over Congress, and you see a dysfunctional House and Senate not able to do the work of the people. But that’s not all of it. Democracy is a structure that is based on founding documents. It’s an idea and it only works when we’re engaged in it. 
When I look at the kind of outpouring that we saw for the No Kings rallies — I did three rallies, one in Jamaica, Vermont, one in Burlington, one up in Saint Albans. There was great turnout in every single spot. The entire drive up through Vermont along Route 7, there were people out along the side of the road, massive turnout across the country. So when you look at the ways in which Americans are responding in this moment, I feel very hopeful. I have a lot of confidence in the resilience of Americans, of our creativity, of our perseverance, of our insatiable desire to want better for ourselves and our kids. So I actually feel like we’re going to prevail in this moment. We are going to prevail because broadly speaking, the American electorate does not want what this administration is offering right now. It’s slowly sinking in for some people and for a lot of us, we knew what was coming. And it’s even worse than perhaps we thought. But it is sinking in among people like Joe Rogan, it is sinking in. 
I met a woman in Saint Albans, an elderly woman. She pulled me aside and said, “I’ve never protested anything in my life. I’ve never been to a rally. But I’m here, and it feels terrific because I was feeling so alone, and now I’m out here.” 
So when I am outside of DC meeting with people and what they’re working on and what they’re working on locally and within the state, I know we’re going to get through this.

Larry Hogan, R-Maryland, (right) said that current governors may be missing an opportunity to have a bigger role in national issues that seem relegated to Congress and the White House if they were able to come together. (Photos by Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters)In a country flooded by a never-ending wave of talking heads, pundits and fiery social media posts, two bipartisan former governors said the solution to America’s political gridlock may be more talking.
But former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, and former Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, said that it’s not about talking on airwaves or to like-minded political party members. Instead, it’s about sitting and talking about common ground — together — face-to-face.
That was the message the two former state leaders and former chairmen of the National Governors Association said during an hour-long panel, “Federalism Tested: How States are Navigating in an Era of Uncertainty,” hosted by the Pew Charitable Trusts and States Newsroom on Tuesday morning.
Both Bullock and Hogan said that despite an apparent growing list of issues that divide the country, most Americans agree on one thing: They’re exhausted by the partisan rhetoric and political gridlock and want politicians to find common ground.
Minnesota assassination prompts many lawmakers to wonder: Is service worth the danger?
They said that organizations like the National Governors Association provide models for how to find common ground and advocate for solutions. And both governors know something about bipartisan work as Hogan, a member of the GOP, served two terms in Maryland, a state dominated by Democrats. Meanwhile, Bullock, a Democrat, served two terms, accomplishing Medicaid expansion and campaign spending reform, with a legislature of nearly two-thirds Republicans.
“There’s more that unites us than divides us,” Hogan said, adding it was a message that resonated with deeply liberal Maryland, because it stressed common solutions and bipartisanship.
“The politics that divide the nation need not divide the state,” Hogan said. “These days, people seem to want to win an argument rather than provide solutions to solve problems.”
Current governors may be missing an opportunity to have a bigger role in the national issues that seem relegated to Congress and the White House, they said. They agreed that if governors were able to come together, they may be better at checking the power of Congress or the president.
“You actually have to govern when you’re a governor,” Bullock said. “And that means you have to stay focused on what’s happening in your own state and to your people.”
That gives governors power to communicate concerns and stand together to influence federal leaders. One example they used was the way the governors’ association worked together during the COVID pandemic. Instead of meeting quarterly, they had weekly meetings via Zoom.
“We didn’t all agree, but we didn’t fight. We simply said: These are the things we need. It was productive,” Hogan said.
Hogan also touted the large infrastructure bill that was shaped by bipartisan input from governors of both parties.
“We don’t see enough of that,” Hogan said.
Both said governors are crucial in the feedback circle because they can pierce the federal bubble in Washington, D.C.
For example, Hogan said that Maryland, during his tenure, was able to eliminate 7,000 jobs through “a scalpel and attrition,” resulting in savings, efficiency and maintaining a high approval rating as governor, nearing 75% statewide.
“What happened with (the Department of Government Efficiency) is we took a meat ax instead of an instrument of precision,” Hogan said. “And every time you lay someone off, it will affect real people.”

Larry Hogan, R-Maryland, (right) says extreme gerrymandering and political primaries that select the more extreme sides of each political party contribute to a sense of gridlock and polarization.

It’s those people whom governors are the closest to, and those stories can be shared by the state leaders.
In Montana, Bullock said, the impacts may be noticeable when visitors travel for “a trip of a lifetime” to places like Yellowstone and Glacier national parks, which may have fewer amenities, or have extraordinary lines.
“At the end of the day, state government isn’t going to be paying for those employees, so when someone has their lifelong dream vacation in Glacier National Park, and can’t get to where they want, states will have to work with federal services,” Bullock said. “Unfortunately, folks have to feel pain for it to be real.”
He also called for more accountability for elected leaders down to the local level who avoid answering constituent questions or press inquiries. He said the media must continue to hold officials accountable by telling the public when leaders won’t speak, and what questions were asked.
Moreover, he said that true bipartisanship begins with individuals who are willing to support leaders whom they don’t always agree with, but demonstrate a commitment to bipartisan solutions.
“Why is it that the most dangerous place in America today is around the Thanksgiving table?” Bullock asked.
Hogan said that extreme gerrymandering and political primaries that select the more extreme sides of each party contribute to a sense of gridlock and polarization.
“We have an exhausted majority,” Hogan said. “The public is sick of it, and that’s why people are fleeing from both parties, becoming political independents.”

(Photo by Ylleana Berryhill/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — University of Oklahoma athletic leaders said Wednesday they are adapting to a new normal in a rapidly changing college sports environment.
Joe Castiglione, University of Oklahoma vice president and director of athletics, said athletes “are bigger, faster, stronger than ever before” and have multiple options even as the university works to recruit the best athletes to compete for championships. 
Castiglione and other OU leaders spoke about the evolving college athletic landscape and what will be needed to stay competitive in the new NIL era at the Oklahoma State Chamber’s annual meeting.
The shift in operations follows the 2021 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which opened the door for college athletes to monetize and have authority over how their name, image and likeness, or NIL, is used.
“The NIL space, as we’ve known it up to this point, has been largely unrestricted, unstructured, so they have, in this sense, the short-term memory of how NIL has been,” Castiglione said. “We’re going to have to help educate them, whether it’s how they can build their brand, how they will get monetized.”
He said OU has begun to focus on college athletics as a business.
“Every time I used to use that word or refer to business, I would get shushed, you know, because we’re part of higher education, college athletics isn’t supposed to sound like a business but we operate very much like one,” Castiglione said.
He said the university will have to pay attention to how it grows and manages expenses. Expenses are growing much more rapidly than the rate of new revenue. 
“We have to be a force multiplier in how we partner with people,” he said.
Castiglione said OU athletics will have a $225 million budget that is totally built on generating its own revenue. 
“We live by a scoreboard for many people in our world so that’s how they measure whether or not we’re successful,” he said. “Culture is going to be the catalyst as a force multiplier, partnerships are going to be a catalyst.” 
He said it is important for the university to compete for championships. That is how they will leverage support. As it grows, athletes and coaches will continue to want to come. 
Castiglione said OU is positioning their program strategically and tactically. 
“I think in this period of disruption, communicating and being proactive in the space can help align our coaches with the right strategy and tactics to navigate what is still an undefined environment,” he said.

City Council members said the ordinance could help prevent incidents of indecent exposure downtown and near schools and playgrounds.

Burlington’s City Council voted unanimously Monday to move forward with an ordinance banning public nudity following complaints from local businesses and residents.
The proposal now heads to the Ordinance Committee for review before going back to the council.
Vermont law generally allows public nudity in cases where the person leaves their house naked, though removing clothes once outside is prohibited. According to the proposed city ordinance, however, Burlington is looking to classify showing one’s “genitals or anal region” as public indecent exposure even if it’s not lewd in nature.  
The ordinance states that public exposure may interfere with people’s right to enjoy public areas without being unwillingly exposed to nudity and discourage community members from visiting spaces where these incidents occur. During the Monday meeting, councilor Becca Brown McKnight said the ordinance could help prevent incidents of indecent exposure that happened near schools and playgrounds. 
Ordinance violations could result in a $100 fine for the first offense and a $200 fine for the second offense if it occurs within six months of the first. A third violation would be considered a criminal offense and carry a $500 fine if it occurs within six months of the second. Partial waivers are available for the first two offenses.
“The intent of this ordinance to ban public nudity has nothing to do with suppressing anyone’s freedom of expression,” Brown McKnight said Tuesday. “We’re hoping the Ordinance Committee can have some kind of a flexibility in there for some of the historical events that might involve nudity in the city.” Brown McKnight said the Ordinance Committee will determine if the ordinance will be citywide or focus on specific areas.
One of the exceptions may be the naked bike ride by University of Vermont students, a longstanding tradition that takes place at the end of each semester near the campus.
“I think no matter if they have a law in place to protect it or disband it, I feel like the naked bike ride would somehow come up again,” said Claire Conklin, a recent University of Vermont graduate who participated in the event in the past. 
Conklin said the way the bike ride is currently organized allows people to express themselves and feel safe, and since it’s publicized in advance, people can decide not to join if they feel uncomfortable. 
“I feel like it kind of goes against the UVM spirit and Burlington as a whole of banning something that other people enjoy,” she added.
The proposal is the result of regular complaints from residents and business owners in downtown Burlington. Around 100 business owners sent a letter to Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak in May expressing concern over the conditions of the city center and requesting action on several items, including a plea for a public nudity ordinance.
“We have observed an increasing trend of individuals engaging in deliberately inappropriate behavior in public spaces, which is causing alarm among families and negatively impacting Burlington’s reputation as a welcoming environment,” they wrote.
“I don’t really think it’s a public safety issue,” councilor Melo Grant said. “These men who have done this have never hurt anyone. … But it is a situation where some people are concerned.”
The public will have the chance to weigh in on the proposal in the coming weeks. Brown McKnight said it might take up to two months before reaching a final resolution, but she doesn’t expect the ban will receive pushback from the community. 
Grant said she will pay attention to the final text of the ordinance before deciding how she will vote on it.
“I wanted to be really cautious about how we proceed. I just don’t want anything that’s going to be weaponized against people,” Grant said, expressing concern that the new ordinance could be used to discriminate against people experiencing homelessness or limit freedom of expression for the LGBTQ+ community.

Lawmakers are weighing a provision that would allow developers to pay a lower wage for some construction projects, theoretically stimulating housing production in California. Unions and environmental groups are opposed. 



California lawmakers are on the cusp of striking a last-minute deal to tie one of the year’s most ambitious and controversial housing bills to a new set of minimum wages for housing construction workers — a proposal that has thrown a wrench into budget negotiations just days before the deadline. 
The new legislative language, buried in a sprawling budget bill put into print on Tuesday, represents a grand political bargain between pro-development advocates and the state’s carpenters union. Supporters say the new arrangement could reshape the way that future California housing legislation is written and negotiated. 
There is intense opposition from other building trades unions, which are among the most powerful interest groups at the state Capitol and whose leaders argue that the bill would undercut hard-fought pay standards. That’s made for a high-stakes showdown as Gov. Gavin Newsom demands major changes to streamline housing construction as part of the budget.
The new wage rates are a major pivot in a debate that has dominated the legislative politics of housing in California for at least a decade. Past bills aimed at making it easier to build new homes have offered a trade: Ease regulations on approvals, permits and environmental regulations in exchange for, among other things, higher guaranteed pay for construction workers. The standard wage rate in those debates have been the “prevailing wages” — state-determined wages that vary by occupation and location that generally work out to what unionized workers earn.
These new proposed rates are significantly lower and are designed to serve as a more development-friendly alternative. They would apply only in cases where developers opt to use a new proposed exception to California’s premier environmental impact law, the California Environmental Quality Act. The vast majority of those projects, small-scale residential construction projects, are not currently covered by prevailing wage.
That’s why supporters of the deal are arguing that the new standards represent a wage increase.
Residential construction is “a virtually non-union industry,” said Danny Curtin, who heads the California Conference of Carpenters. “You have the ability to give those people a substantial — a modest, but substantial and important — raise.”
Even so, the pushback from other construction labor groups has been fierce.
The State Building and Construction Trades Council, a construction union umbrella group that regularly clashes with the carpenters union on labor issues, excoriated the proposal in a letter to legislative leadership yesterday.
“This proposal is a wage grab of construction workers’ wages disguised in an ‘affordable housing bill,’” the letter by council president Chris Hannan said. “We urge you to abandon any pursuit of this harmful and unprecedented proposal, which would devastate construction workers.”
Lawmakers also appeared caught off guard by the proposal at an Assembly budget hearing on Wednesday packed with union advocates.
“I didn’t come to Sacramento to cut people’s wages,” said Assemblymember Chris Rogers, a Ukiah Democrat. “I didn’t sit through months of budget committee hearings talking about how to preserve our social safety net to then, at the 11th hour, potentially kick more people onto it.” 
Assemblymember Lashae Sharp Collins, a Democrat from La Mesa, called the fact that the building trades reportedly weren’t consulted “appalling.” 
The new wage proposal received a similarly icy reception from many Democrats in the Senate, which also held a budget hearing on Wednesday.
“You’re presenting something at the last minute, I don’t know who you consulted with, and you reached this conclusion to completely change the structure for the way that workers in the construction industry would be paid,” said Sen. Maria Elena Durazo, a Los Angeles Democrat and a reliable ally of the trades.
The bill was scheduled to be voted on Friday. In the face of furious pushback a budget committee hearing vote in the Senate was delayed on Wednesday, making the timing of its final vote uncertain.
Though the last-minute addition of contentious labor language threatens to divide legislative Democrats, the party holds two-thirds of the seats in both legislative chambers, giving the budget bill ample opportunities to pass even with significant defections.
A debate months in the making
This new proposal is the latest addition to a policy idea introduced in March by Oakland Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks. The bill would exempt most new apartment buildings in urban areas from CEQA, the environmental law.
The 55-year-old law is the frequent target of lawmakers and pro-housing advocates who argue that it can be weaponized to slow or impede desperately needed new housing and other projects. Many environmental advocacy groups and organized labor groups defend the law as an important check on unwanted or environmentally harmful development.
Wicks’ idea got a helpful boost last month when Newsom opted to fold it into his proposed budget for the coming year, putting it on a speedier and surer path to becoming law. He has since threatened to withhold his signature from the budget if legislators do not approve the sweeping housing measures, some of which are still being negotiated.
A key part of that budget package — what’s called a trailer bill — is before the Legislature now. The bill includes Wicks’ exemption tied to the new labor language, along with key components of other housing bills, including a proposed freeze on building code changes, limits on the fees that landlords can charge tenants and an expanded tax credits for renters.
Assemblymember Nick Schultz, the Burbank Democrat who authored the building code freeze bill, noted that he wasn’t informed by the governor’s office or Assembly leadership that his proposal was being tucked into the budget bill. He said he found out from an advocacy group.
By setting wages far below the “prevailing wage” rates required by law for publicly funded projects — and frequently demanded by construction unions for their support for housing bills — it is meant to offer a more financially feasible alternative, while still boosting the pay of workers at the lowest end of the labor market.

In Oakland, for example, a carpenter making the state-set “prevailing wage” for a residential project earns at least $99 per hour including benefits.
The new minimum wages would only require that the majority of construction workers across the Bay Area covered under the policy be paid at least $40 an hour. Less skilled or experienced workers would require at least $27 per hour. Smaller housing projects of 25 units or fewer would be exempt entirely.
The budget bill also includes language that would give unions the right to take contractors to court for workers compensation, insurance and payroll tax violations.
“Yes in my backyard” advocates that have historically looked askance at prevailing wage requirements are celebrating the new deal. 
“This is one of the biggest wins for housing in a generation,” California YIMBY president Brian Hanlon said in a statement. “Building infill housing is not a threat to the environment — it’s how we save it.”
Carpenters and YIMBYs collaborate again
Though new wage rates only apply to Wicks’ urban infill exemption, hammering out a deal with a major labor group allowing for pay significantly below prevailing wage would spell a significant shift in California labor policy.
This isn’t the first time the state’s carpenters union has cut a high-profile deal to push a major YIMBY-backed housing bill across the legislative finish line. 
In 2022, Wicks’ bill to fast-track apartment construction along stripmall corridors earned the endorsement of the carpenters after she added a prevailing wage requirement, along with some other benefits. 
At the time that was considered a political concession. For years the state’s other major construction worker union group, the Trades Council, had made the inclusion of so-called skilled-and-trained standards — essentially, a requirement to hire predominantly unionized workers — the price of their support for housing bills.

In breaking with the trades, the carpenters have long argued that clearing the way for the construction of more housing, even at the expense of higher mandatory wages, represents an “organizing opportunity” for the union.
After Wicks’ bill passed over the Trades Council’s strenuous objection, other pro-development lawmakers came to see that deal as something they could effectively copy and paste into their housing legislation, all but guaranteeing the support of an unlikely coalition of developers, union workers and YIMBY activists. 
Even so, many developers continue to argue that prevailing wage rates are still too costly to make construction pencil out beyond the state’s priciest metro areas, making those prior housing bills ineffective at actually producing more housing.
Supporters of this new deal say the lower wage standard could be the next go-to legislative language for future housing bills.
“This bill is a big step forward and an important test of whether the ‘YIMBY-Carpenter alliance’ can enact housing bills that generate housing production at scale,” UC Davis law professor Chris Elmendorf wrote on X.

Statewide progress monitoring scores, announced by Gov. Ron DeSantis Wednesday, detail how Florida’s students performed in reading, math, social studies, and science.
Math scores for all students from third grade to high school improved by 3% from 2024, with 58% of students demonstrating a level 3 or higher understanding. The county with the lowest score was Gadsden, with 35% testing at a level 3 or higher, and the highest, Nassau, with 78%.
Level 3, on the state’s scale of 1-5, is considered on grade level. Level 4 is considered proficient and level 5 is considered exemplary. Students who scored below level 3 are considered below or well below grade level.
Reading scores for students in grades 3-10 increased from 53% at level three or higher in 2024 to 57% in 2025. Gadsden County had the lowest performance at 36% at level 3 or higher and St. Johns was the highest at 72%.
“Florida insists that education be factual, student-focused, and parent empowered,” DeSantis said in a news release. “Florida has led the nation in instituting progress monitoring assessments that allow for teachers and parents to provide real-time interventions that support the long-term success of their students, and our approach has paid off.”
The progress monitoring tests are administered three times per year by the state. The periodic testing is designed to allow instructors to make interventions for struggling students sooner. This is the third year of progress monitoring in Florida.
During the Spring 2025 end-of-course assessment for the civics assessment, 71% of students tested at a level 3 or higher; 47% were proficient or higher.
“Today’s results affirm that our first-in-the-nation statewide progress monitoring system is making a difference for our students. Under Governor DeSantis’ leadership, Florida will continue to provide the best opportunities for our students,” Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. said in a news release.

This year Florida scores dropped on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Eighth grade math scores have dropped in the last three iterations of the test, and Florida students that age ranked in the bottom 10 states for math and reading scores. Fourth grade reading scores on the NAEP were the lowest in 2024 since 2003, while their math scores increased but remain below pre-pandemic numbers.
The data for the NAEP, collected in early 2024, were disputed by Diaz, who questioned the methodology of the exam. Diaz wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Education with “suggestions to help make NAEP great for educational progress once again.”
He took issue with the lack of inclusion of private school students and he believed urban students were included at a disproportionate rate.
Diaz will step down next month to become interim president of the University of West Florida. Earlier this month, the Florida Board of Education named DeSantis deputy chief of staff Anastasios Kamoutsas the next education commissioner.

“Florida is a national leader in education because we are not afraid to challenge the status quo,” Kamoutsas said in the news release. “Progress monitoring assessments are a prime example of how Florida has changed education for the better, and the scores are proof of our successful approach.”
According to department data, students who are African American improved reading scores, with 45% scoring a level 3 or above in 2025 compared to those 40% scoring at the same level in 2024. Hispanic students increased performance during the same time frame on math, with 55% scoring level 3 or higher compared to 51% the year before.

(Photo by Mladen Sladojevic/Getty Images) Hospitals and surgery centers made more errors in 2024 than in previous years, continuing an upward trend that began in 2020, according to a report released Tuesday by the Minnesota Department of Health. 
Overall, facilities reported 624 medical mistakes between October 2023 and October 2024, 14 more than in the previous year, though the total number of surgeries increased even more. There were 70% more errors in 2024 than in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Health officials have attributed the increase in so-called adverse health events — 29 often-preventable errors that could result in serious injury or death — to staffing shortages and an aging population. In 2024, there was a nearly 9% increase in surgeries compared to the previous year, but only a 2% increase in the number of mistakes.
“We are glad to see the rate of increase in the number of adverse health events beginning to slow,” Minnesota Commissioner of Health Brooke Cunningham said in a news release.
The mistakes resulted in 14 deaths, two fewer than in 2023, and 224 serious injuries. 
Severe bedsores were by far the most common incident reported to MDH, accounting for nearly half of the incidents. Patient falls; loss of a biological specimen, like a placenta; leaving a foreign object inside a patient’s body; and performing a surgery on the wrong part of the body were among the other most common errors.
The small increase in the number of bedsores is partially related to more patients refusing repositioning, and an increase in the number of patients with conditions that make them especially vulnerable to bedsores, according to the report.
There were four deaths and 90 serious injuries related to falls, nearly half of which occurred when patients were using the restroom.

Proposal to keep targeting 50% more cats in western mountains — a change brought about to appease outfitters upset about deer — aligns with a statewide trend of heavily hunting cougars. 
The post Wyoming keeps lion hunting pressure dialed high as mature cats become scarce appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s nearly two-decade-old mountain lion management plan lays out three primary strategies for the native felines. 
Areas where lions exist at healthy, natural densities that are managed for long-term hunting of the big cats are classified as “sources.” Regions with  densities deemed “relatively high” — where the goal is to maintain lion numbers — are labeled “stable.” And then there are “sink” management areas, where hunting seasons are set with the goal of reducing lion numbers. 
In 2006, when Wyoming embarked upon its source-stable-sink lion management regime, a dozen of the state’s 29 lion areas were managed as “sources,” and a 13th area was marked a blend of “source” and “stable.” A single area in the southern Bighorns was then branded as a “sink.” 
Times have changed. 
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department, which typically updates its lion regulations every three years, has retained only four areas as population “sources,” according to the latest statewide mortality report. “Sinks,” meanwhile, increased from one in 2006 to six hunting areas during the last cycle, from 2022 to 2024.
Over time, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has transitioned to a management regime that has decreased the age of mountain lions through heavy hunting. (WGFD)
The maximum number of lions permitted to be killed by hunters across Wyoming has steadily grown. And the number of cougars actually killed has risen in tandem, and is now approaching or exceeding 350 cats killed annually, according to the state’s data. Populations, of which there are no good estimates in the state, are now hunted so heavily that in many places there are very few remaining mature animals. It’d be the equivalent of an elk herd that’s almost exclusively calves, yearling cows and spike bulls.   

Mountain lion mortality has been on the upswing in Wyoming since the creation of the state’s modern management plan two decades ago. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
Luke Worthington, president of the Wyoming Houndsman Association, has seen it firsthand. A houndsman who guides clients along the west slope of the Bighorn Mountains in areas 21 and 22 — both managed as a blend of “stable” and “sink” — he’s grown accustomed to seeing very few signs of lions overall, and then treeing only youngsters.

“There’s no age structure there at all, it’s all young cats,” Worthington said. “I drove almost 5,000 miles in 14 days and cut less than 10 tracks.” 
Over the two weeks of hunting there last winter, he found a single mature tom. 
Worthington tried to tilt the hunting regulations in the mountain lions’ favor. The houndsman lobbied to drop the mortality limits in areas 21 and 22 — and thought the idea had some traction. 
“We had all the game wardens and bios in those areas on board,” Worthington said. “They see the problem. And it was not even brought to the [Game and Fish] Commission.” 
When Game and Fish rolled out its draft lion hunting regulations this spring, the maximum number of cats that could be killed in the two western Bighorn hunt areas stayed the same, at 45 animals. 
Statewide, mortality limits either rose or stayed the same. One area, in Wyoming’s far southeast corner, is positioned to transition into an “unlimited” hunt, joining other “unlimited” hunt areas in the southern Bighorns, Powder River Basin and the Casper Mountain region.
Even in the Wyoming Range, Gros Ventres and western Winds, wildlife managers held onto 50% higher mountain lion hunting limits that were put into place due to big game outfitter pressure following an especially deadly winter for mule deer and pronghorn. The changes were made despite a lack of evidence that killing lions would help bring the ungulate herds back. 

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department has proposed 50% increases in mountain lion quotas in four hunt areas, pictured here. Specifically, unit 14 would go from a 20-cat quota to 30; unit 17, from 5 to 8; unit 26, from 15 to 23; and unit 29, from 6 to 9 cats. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
Two years later, Game and Fish proposed to retain 50% higher quotas in hunt areas 14, 17, 26 and 29, continuing with management that allows a maximum of 61 cats to be killed in the western hunt areas. 
Like in the western Bighorns, it’s an approach that’s working to drive down lion numbers.
“In areas such as Wyoming Range, where there was a great deal of public interest to kill as many lions as possible, we’re seeing that come forth,” Game and Fish Large Carnivore Supervisor Dan Thompson told WyoFile. “Once you start getting any adult female segment, then you start ramping into everything, and you get a younger age class and less lions overall.” 
While trapping lions for research along the Wyoming Range’s western front, state biologists saw indications of the reduced numbers. 
“It was harder to cut a track this last winter, for sure,” Thompson said. “It was pretty few and far between.”
Worthington, who lives in the Gillette area, heard the rumors from across the state. 
“For that Cokeville study, Game and Fish went up there and they found no lions,” the Wyoming Houndsmen Association president said. “That’s pretty freaking alarming.” 
Maps presented at the Game and Fish’s lion season-setting meetings illustrated the heavier hunting in western Wyoming, and its population effects. During the last three-year cycle, for example, virtually all the lions killed along the Salt River Range front in eastern Star Valley were immature animals. 
Red circles denote female mountain lions and blue circles are males killed in this map that depicts hunting success in Wyoming’s hunt area 26, which surrounds Star Valley, the Salt River Range and western reaches of the Wyoming Range. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
There was a discussion about returning to the lower quotas, Thompson said, but ultimately, in conjunction with Game and Fish’s regional offices, they opted to keep the pressure ratcheted up. 
“We want to maintain our ability to manage mountain lions as Game and Fish,” Thompson said. 
Last winter, Rep. Mike Schmid, a La Barge Republican who lives butted up against the badly winterkilled mule deer range, ran a bill that would have essentially stripped state wildlife managers of their authority over lions. The idea met overwhelming opposition and died.
Young mountain lions, like this one in a standoff with coyotes on the National Elk Refuge in 2013, dominate populations in portions of Wyoming where there’s heavy hunting. (Lori Iverson / U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)
If Wyoming wildlife managers do someday opt to allow for healthier mountain lion populations, they know from experience that the big cats can bounce back. Even where mountain lions were extirpated during the settlement era, like the Black Hills, cats eventually reoccupied and thrived due to the normally sturdy deer population. In a place like the Wyoming Range and western Bighorns, lions haven’t been hunted out of existence — just greatly reduced. 
“If there’s adequate immigration, it takes three years to get some of the densities back,” Thompson said. “Five years to get that social structure back.”
Game and Fish commissioners still must OK the draft mountain lion regulations, which will govern what the state’s hunting seasons — and, in turn, cougar populations — look like for the next three years. The governor-appointed body is set to review the proposal on July 16 in Casper. 
Commission meetings provide a stage for the public to weigh in on mountain lions, whether they want to urge killing more of them or advocate for taking it easier on Wyoming’s population. Houndsmen typically play the role of mountain lion advocates, but they largely didn’t appear, at least during the public meetings about the draft regulations. In Pinedale, for example, zero houndsmen turned out to hear about plans to retain 50% more mortality in a region where hunting pressure has been taking its toll. 
Worthington is frustrated. 
“The houndsmen not commenting?” he said. “I don’t even know what to say about it.”

What every Pennsylvania county shares is public transportation that connects people and communities to work, school and essential services.","People ride SEPTA articulated bus in Philadelphia. (Courtesy of Getty Images)In the debate over how to fund Pennsylvania’s roads, bridges and transit systems, one counterproductive misconception persists: that mass transit, and specifically SEPTA, is a “Philadelphia problem.” Nothing could be further from the truth.
From Pike County to Erie County, Westmoreland County to Lehigh County, Pennsylvania’s businesses rely on a robust network of roads, bridges and transit systems to bring employees to work and attract customers. What every Pennsylvania county shares is public transportation that connects people and communities to work, school and essential services.
Here in Chester County, and the Greater Philadelphia region, our economic growth has been undergirded by this system, with SEPTA mass transit at its foundation. 
SEPTA is an essential cog in the economic engine of Southeastern Pennsylvania — an engine that generates billions in economic output and tax revenue for the entire state. A weakened SEPTA means a weakened regional economy, and that ripples out to the rest of Pennsylvania in real dollars. The income, business, and sales taxes generated here help fund state programs and services that benefit all 67 counties. When our region suffers due to impaired transit, the state’s ability to reinvest equitably across Pennsylvania suffers too.
Counties across Pennsylvania also benefit directly from SEPTA’s operations every day — not just through travel, but through jobs, procurement, and commerce. Over the past five years, SEPTA has awarded over $1.14 billion in contracts to Pennsylvania-based companies in 39 counties, with an average annual investment of $228 million. That’s not just rail cars and bus routes in the southeast — that’s steel, rubber, electronics, parts, safety equipment, and professional services supporting jobs across the Commonwealth.
If SEPTA is forced to cut service or delay infrastructure upgrades due to unstable state funding, it’s not just riders in the southeast who are directly impacted. It’s those employers and the Pennsylvanians they employ who will also feel the impact. SEPTA is one of the largest transit systems in the country and one of Pennsylvania’s largest purchasers of goods and services — and when funding cannot fully support operations, that economic activity across the entire Commonwealth is also reduced.
This is proof of a fundamental truth: mass transit is regional infrastructure with statewide economic impact.
We fully support statewide transit funding to address SEPTA’s shortfall this year to avoid devastating cuts. But we also recognize the need for a long-term, sustainable solution that ensures our public transit systems — not just in Philadelphia, but across the state — are viable for the future. We are not suggesting a blank check or permanent patchwork. We are advocating for a smart, stable, and transparent approach that recognizes the shared value of a functioning, modern transit system.
Now is not the time to retreat. With major global events like America 250, the FIFA World Cup, the MLB All-Star Game, the PGA Championship and the NFL Draft all coming to Pennsylvania in the next year, our transit infrastructure must be ready to move tens of millions of visitors efficiently and safely. Without it, the region — and the state — will miss out on untold economic opportunity and global visibility.
Pennsylvania must now rise to meet this moment — and not just to “save” transit, but to invest in what it already delivers: regional economic impact, workforce access, and job creation.
This isn’t about urban vs. rural or east vs. west. It’s about building a statewide economy that moves — powered by a mass transit system that serves millions of Pennsylvanians in all 67 counties. 
If you’re a business owner or policymaker outside of southeastern Pennsylvania, don’t think of SEPTA as someone else’s concern. Think of it as your next contract, your next job posting, your next opportunity. It’s time we fund transit operations across all of Pennsylvania like the statewide engine it is.

In one instance, a restaurant was fined for serving food without first obtaining a license and approval from the state. In another, a restaurant’s kitchen was temporarily closed down after an inspector realized the business had no way to sanitize dishes and food preparation utensils.
The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level. Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, care facilities and other businesses between May 14 and June 17. (In March, DIAL began withholding from public disclosure, for eight days past the date of inspection, all food-safety inspection reports.)
The inspections department reminds the public that their reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment.

Azteca 4, 3566 N. Brady St., Davenport – During a June 3 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 12 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number, and several good-practice violations.
Among the issues: Open containers of food product on the shelves near the walk-in cooler were visibly contaminated with mouse-like droppings; raw pork was stored above heads of lettuce, risking cross-contamination, and several staff members were observed failing to wash their hands and change gloves after handling raw steak and chicken.
Also, unrefrigerated shredded cheese was stored near the grill and was measured at 50 degrees; date-markings to ensure freshness and safety were inconsistent with some workers dating products for the day they were prepared and others dating products for the day they were to be discarded; carnitas inside the walk-in cooler had been held for more than the maximum of seven days, and several knives in the clean-knife rack were soiled with food debris.
In addition, the shelving in the walk-in cooler was soiled with food debris, as was the steel shelving below the steam table, and vacuum-sealed tilapia and steak were being thawed without first being removed their packaging to reduce to the risk of spoilage going undetected.
The inspector also noted that raw, whole fish was being thawed in standing water, and reported that “cockroach-like insects” had been found throughout the back kitchen area. Also, “mouse-like droppings were found throughout the back kitchen area and on shelving,” and there were “cockroach-like insect carcasses at various stages of life” were seen throughout the back kitchen area.
The inspector also reported there was hot water supplied to the handwashing sink in the back food-prep area, and tiles and baseboards throughout the kitchen were missing, loose or in disrepair. “Flooring throughout the back kitchen area has standing water,” the inspector reported.
The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint from a customer who alleged they dined at Azteca 4 June 2 and observed live roaches in the restaurant. The complaint was deemed verified. According to the county inspector, a pest-control technician who had recently visited the restaurant noted in a report that tiles and baseboards were missing and broken and there was “standing water throughout the facility” — issues that could be contributing to the proliferation of pests.
On June 4, the inspector returned and reported, “Progress has been made on additional cleaning throughout the kitchen. Dead cockroach-like insects still present throughout, as well as mouse droppings.”
On June 5, the inspector returned again and reported, “Facility has made even more progress, but additional re-inspections will need to be done as pests are still present.”
On June 10, the inspector was back and reported that “roaches and mouse-like droppings are being addressed by additional cleaning.”
On June 13, the inspector returned and reported, “Significant improvements have been made with pest control issues. No live activity during today’s visit.”
City Loafers, 215 N. Main St., Davenport – During a June 17 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Among the issues: Pork stored in the preparation cooler was measured at 69 to 70 degrees and had to be discarded; several food items were not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety; precooked chicken wings had a date-marking of May 6, five weeks prior to the inspection, and had to be discarded; and mold was found on black olives, sliced peppers and raw salmon stored in the main kitchen’s walk-in cooler.
Also, there was ham date-marked May 21 and roast beef date-marked June 4 inside the walk-in cooler, and excess food debris was found on the bakers’ racks and the interior of all the coolers in the kitchen.
The inspector also noted there was water pooling on the bottom of the food-preparation cooler in the main kitchen; the equipment in the main kitchen was marred by “excess food debris and grease,” and there was an excessive amount of dust and debris in several other areas.
McDonald’s, 3621 Lincoln Way, Ames – During a June 17 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for liquid eggs, ham, and rehydrated onions in the reach-in cooler that were measured at 47 to 54 degrees, and which had to be discarded. Also, the interior of the ice machine was noted to have a “buildup of organic matter” within it. The restaurant last underwent a routine inspection in July 2023, according to state records.
Pella Golf & Country Club, 600 Elm St., Pella – During a June 13 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector reported there were home-canned food items found on a shelf in the food-preparation area and which had to be discarded as coming from an unapproved source. Also, food items on the salad bar were not maintained at 41 degrees or colder, with the creamy pasta salad measured at 49 degrees, the potato salad at 54 degrees and the boiled eggs at 56 degrees. All of the items were discarded.

Tipton Family Restaurant, 101 4th St., Tipton — During a June 13 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number, and concluded the business lacked adequate controls for monitoring established systems and practices such as employee handwashing, monitoring food temperatures and preventing cross-contamination of food.
The inspector also noted that raw pork and beef were stored above ready-to-eat food inside the coolers, and rice cooked the previous day had yet to cool to 41 degrees and had to be discarded. Also, whole eggs were stored on a kitchen cart at room temperature, and grilled onions and cooked rice had been held longer than the maximum of seven days.
Szechuan House, 320 E. Burlington St., Iowa City – During a June 10 visit, a Johnson County inspector reported that “pieced-out chicken” was being stored “in a bucket of water that is at room temperature, 71 degrees,” and had to be discarded.

Also, the pizza table was holding food at 48 to 55 degrees, resulting in all of the associated food items that had been prepared more than two hours earlier being discarded.  The inspector also noted that pasta inside the walk-cooler had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. In addition, the dishwashing machine was not properly sanitizing dishes, and a pan of shrimp was stored in the kitchen’s handwashing sink.
Burger Shed, 500 Bass Pro Drive, Altoona – During a May 14 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 15 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number, and concluded that the business lacked adequate controls for monitoring established systems and practices such as handwashing and maintaining proper food temperatures.
The inspector reported that smoked chicken wings placed in the walk-in cooler two days earlier had yet to cool to 41 degrees and were holding at 46 degrees. Also, pans of cooked cheeseburger soups placed in the cooler four hours earlier were measured at 82 to 86 degrees. The soup and the chicken wings were discarded.
The inspector also made note of numerous other cold food items that were being held at 44 to 59 degrees and which had to be discarded, including sliced tomatoes, house-made ranch dressing, cut lettuce, burger patties, smoked wings, macaroni and cheese balls, honey mustard, cheddar cheese and sour cream. The inspector also observed that racks of buns were being stored in a dry storage area on the ground.
Aunt Emmy’s, 114 N. Franklin St., Manchester – During a June 9 visit, a state inspector found that food products inside a retail-sales cooler were holding at temperatures above the maximum 41 degrees, resulting in homemade soup and other items being discarded. The inspector also reported that cooked meats, homemade soups and burritos that were stored in freezers had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety, and that homemade ranch dressing and roasted red pepper dressing had been held for more than the maximum of seven days.

Lili La Catrachita, 86th Street and Hickman Road, Clive – During a June 9 visit to this food truck, a state inspector reported that rotisserie chickens from Sam’s Club did not bear the required mark of inspection for a food-service establishment. The business agreed to discontinue serving the prepared Sam’s Club chickens in the future. The inspector also noted that hot rotisserie chickens were measured at 107 degrees and beans at 118 degrees, which resulted in both items being discarded, while cold rotisserie chickens were measured at 44 to 51 degrees and also had to be discarded.
Hy-Vee Foods, 1201 12th Ave. SW, Le Mars – During a June 6 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department noted there was raw, ground pork stored next to whole-muscle pork, without the required barrier to prevent cross-contamination, in the meat counter area. Also, various bags of shredded lettuce were measured at 48 to 49 degrees, too warm to ensure their safety, and had to be discarded.
In addition, cooked eggs and breakfast sandwiches in the convenience store had been held for more than the maximum of seven days and were discarded. The inspector also reported that meat crumbles in the kitchen cooler, used for pizzas, had been held for more than seven days, and that hot food items on the roller grill of the convenience store were not time stamped to indicate when the products must be thrown out.
Avion Express, 619 Buddy Holly Place, Clear Lake – During a June 6 visit, a Cerro Gordo County inspector reported there was “no running water to supply the handwashing sinks.” In addition, ground beef in the steam table was measured at only 124 degrees, and “many items” items in the food-preparation line were measured at 48 to 54 degrees.
Landmark, 128 W. Evans St., Williamsburg – During a June 4 visit, a state inspector found diced fruit with mold on it inside the walk-in cooler. Also, mushrooms, turkey and ribs were not properly labeled, and pasta, lemon waffle mix, apple waffle mix, and stroganoff sauce were all held past the maximum of seven days.
In addition, frozen fish that was stored in vacuum-sealed packaging was not removed from the packaging before thawing to reduce the risk of any spoilage going undetected. Also, the floors and walls were reported as “not clean.” The visit was prompted by a non-illness complaint alleging inadequate cooking. The complaint was deemed unverified.
Foundry Food & Tap, 3266 Crosspark Road, Coralville – During a June 3 visit, a Johnson County inspector reported observing an employee handling ready-to-eat lettuce with their bare hands. Also, chicken was being cooked to an internal temperature of only 115 degrees. An employee was instructed to return the chicken to the grill and cook it to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees. Also, mashed potatoes in a hot-holding unit were measured at only 119 degrees and had to be reheated on the grill to at least 165 degrees.
Bunkers, 1900 Country Club Drive, Coralville – During a May 30 visit, a Johnson County inspector noted that a worker handled raw hamburger then went to touch ready-to-eat bread without changing gloves or washing hands.

Also, chicken was being cooled in a metal pan stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler, there was a buildup of grease behind the wall on the grill line, and there were large amounts of dust buildup on the ceiling fans in the kitchen. “Multiple ceiling tiles are missing from ceiling,” the inspector reported. “Ceiling is no longer water resistant or cleanable.” The inspector also reported that the establishment had not posted its license of its most recent inspection report.
Tony’s Chicago Pizza and Breakfast, 2297 Falcon Ave., Bettendorf – During a May 30 visit, a Scott County inspector observed an employee cutting fresh strawberries without gloves and noted that packages of raw ground sausage were stored above ready-to-eat food products, risking cross-contamination. Also, meatballs and marinara sauce were measured at 68 degrees to 110 degrees while being held on the steam table and had to be reheated to 165 degrees before being returned to the steam table.
In addition, a large beef roast that was cooked the previous day had yet to cool to 41 degrees in the walk-in cooler and had to be discarded. The inspector reported that several prepared products had been held for more than the maximum of seven days, including sausage dated May 17, and several containers of au jus dated May 16 and May 22. In addition, the staff was not washing cantaloupe prior to cutting for use in fruit cups.
King’s Harvest, 824 W. 3rd St., Davenport – During a May 21 visit, a Scott County inspector reported the restaurant was not employing a certified food protection manager as required. Also, the inspector found packaged ground beef and breakfast sausage patties that were labeled “not for sale” and which had to be discarded, as well as an assortment of fruits and vegetables in dented cans. “Mouse-like droppings on shelving in back food-storage room and in flour bin,” the inspector reported, adding that was an excess of food debris in the drawer used to store clean utensils.
La Amiguita Fruteria, 428 NE 4th St., Hampton – During a May 19 visit, a state inspector cited this business of 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number, and noted that the person in charge was not a certified food protection manager and did not adequately demonstrate knowledge of food safety principles. The business was cited for being unable to verify that its ice cream was from a licensed, approved facility, and for having homemade fruit syrups that were prepared in a private residence. In addition, the business lacked the ability to properly sanitize dishes due to the absence of any food-safe chemical sanitizing solution. As a result, the kitchen was closed for food preparation until that issue could be addressed.
Tavern 61, 202 W. Mayne St., Blue Grass – During a May 16 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that employees were not properly maintaining the temperatures of food items. Taco meat that was left in a warmer for an hour was measured at only 51 degrees and had to be reheated to 165 degrees before being returned to the warmer. In addition, employees left their drink cups and cell phones on food-preparation surfaces and were seen handling hamburger buns and ready-to-eat foods with their bare hands.
Also, several homemade dressings had been held for more than the maximum of seven days, there was a buildup of a pink substance in the bulk ice chest, there was no hot water supplied to one handwashing sink, and frozen pizza crusts were being stored on the floor of the walk-in freezer.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DIAL-INSPECTIONS.jpg,,,2025-06-25 18:07:36.108581
,DC,2025-06-25 21:11:54+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"$1,000 'Trump Accounts' for babies skewed toward the wealthy, critics say",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/1000-trump-accounts-babies-skewed-toward-wealthy-critics-say,,"WASHINGTON — Tucked in the “one big beautiful bill” is a proposal for tax-advantaged “Trump Accounts,” each seeded with $1,000 from the government for certain babies born in the United States over the next few years.But financial experts and advocates for low-income children are not overly impressed.The idea is not new and has been likened to other “baby bonds” programs aimed at reducing the growing wealth gap, like state-run trust funds in California and Connecticut. Democrats in Congress have introduced a bill to create a similar federal program. The White House has touted the proposal in the tax and spending cut measure as “pro-family” and one that “will afford a generation of children the chance to experience the miracle of compounded growth.”At a June 9 event to promote the “Trump Accounts” featuring CEOs of top American companies, President Donald Trump promised the pilot program will make it possible for “countless American children to have a strong start in life at no cost to the American taxpayer.”Speaking at the same event, top House Republican tax writer Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri said “every child born under this policy will have a better shot at a future. It does not matter if they live on a city block or on a county road, this will make a significant difference to their lives.”Critics say the accounts, as proposed, would mostly benefit children born to wealthier families.They also say the restricted-access accounts, and the one-time government contribution of $1,000, will not help in the face of cuts to food and health programs for low-income people written into the massive budget reconciliation bill, titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”How ‘Trump Accounts’ would workThe investment savings accounts would be available to U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028, and whose parent, or parents, if legally married, already have Social Security numbers.Each year, from a child’s birth to age 18, family and friends, parents’ employers, churches and other private foundations, could contribute up to a combined $5,000 annually to the investment account that will track a stock index and gain interest accordingly.Deposits into the account are taxed. Later on, withdrawals would be subject to the long-term capital gains tax — a tax on the profit made from selling an asset, or investment, that a person has held for longer than a year.After reaching 18, the account beneficiary could access half the account’s value only for qualified expenses that include higher education, vocational training, the purchase of a first home, and costs associated with an enterprise for which the beneficiary has received a small business loan or small farm loan.The beneficiary could access the remaining half of the account after age 25. At age 31, the account loses its status as a “Trump Account” and any remaining balance is taxed as income.Drawbacks seenThe Urban Institute warns that the proposed structure of the account will mostly benefit wealthy families who already have the resources to grow the funds.The bottom 80% of households, by income, only hold half as much cash on hand as the top 20% of households, according to the left-leaning think tank’s nationwide financial health data.Additionally, because of penalties for early withdrawals, lower-income families would be incentivized to save in less restrictive accounts, according to the think tank’s May 27 analysis.The institute recommends the government provide more contributions based on income level, beyond just the one-time $1,000, and lessen the penalties for accessing cash for catastrophic events.A 2023 Democratic legislative proposal put forth by Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Ayana Pressley of Massachusetts aimed to create an account that would target the benefit to children from lower-income households.Their plan suggests accounts be initially seeded with $1,000, and then children would receive up to an additional $2,000 annually based on their family’s income level.According to Booker’s and Pressley’s plan, a child from a family of four that brings in less than $25,100 in annual income would have an estimated $46,200 in investment savings by the time they turn 18.Under the Trump Account proposal, a child’s one-time $1,000 deposit from the government would grow to roughly $5,000 by age 18 if no other contributions were ever made, according to the Urban Institute.Child tax creditsBrendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the GOP proposal “wasn’t particularly well thought through.”“It's this question of whether it makes more sense to give every family $1,000 that they can’t access in those really important years, or whether you should have expanded the child tax credit,” Duke said.Duke criticized lawmakers’ proposals that do not expand the child tax credit to the lowest-income families in the massive GOP budget reconciliation package.While the House version temporarily expands the credit to $2,500 per child, up from $2,000, and the Senate version permanently expands the credit by a more modest amount of $2,200, neither version expands income or refundability parameters that would benefit the poorest families.The CBPP estimates that 17 million children are left out of the credit because of the restrictions.Existing savings vehiclesAnother criticism of the Trump Accounts is that they provide a redundant option among the several existing tax-preferred savings vehicles for Americans, including 529 education investment savings accounts, Roth and Traditional IRAs and Health Savings Accounts.The Tax Foundation’s Alex Muresianu said the account is “a move toward complexity rather than simplification.”“We already have plenty of savings accounts with specific purposes, and a lot of different strings attached,” said Muresianu, senior policy analyst with the right-leaning foundation.“We don't really need another targeted account for a specific purpose, rather than a more easily accessible account with fewer conditions.”",,,,2025-06-25 18:07:36.108581

Tony Evers overstepped his partial veto power by exercising it on a bill to implement new literacy programs in the state. Evers scolded the decision, while lawmakers said it upheld the balance of power and that they plan to release the funds now. 
The decision reverses a lower court, which ruled Evers hadn’t overstepped his power but held that the court did not have the power to compel the Legislature to release the funds. 
The case, Wisconsin State Legislature v. Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, involves 2023 Wisconsin Act 100 — one part of a series of measures meant to support the creation of new literacy programs in Wisconsin. 
In the 2023-25 budget, lawmakers and Evers approved $50 million for new literacy programs but the funding went into a supplemental fund, meaning it required the Republican-led Joint Finance Committee to approve its release to the Department of Public Instruction before it could be used.
2023 Wisconsin Act 20  created an Office of Literacy within the Department of Public Instruction, which would be responsible for establishing an early literacy coaching program and awarding grants to schools. Act 100  was a separate law to create a way for the agency to expend the money transferred by the Joint Committee on Finance.
Evers exercised a partial veto when signing Act 100 into law to expand it from covering a “literacy coaching program” to covering a “literacy program.” The action led to lawmakers withholding the funding, saying he didn’t have the authority to change the law’s purpose, the argument at the center of their subsequent lawsuit. Evers’ administration had argued the bill was an appropriation, and therefore it was within the governor’s powers to partially veto it, and that the Legislature was not within its right to withhold the money.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the Legislature had not been improperly withholding the funding from DPI and that Act 100 was not an appropriation, so Evers overstepped the boundaries of the veto power given to him in the Wisconsin State Constitution. The decision overturns part of the ruling of a Dane County judge.
The state constitution gives the governor the power to sign or veto bills in full, and a 1930 amendment gave the governor the power to partially veto “appropriation bills.” Wisconsin’s executive partial veto power is one of the strongest in the country, though it has been limited over the last several decades by constitutional amendments and through Court rulings.
The state Supreme Court’s 7-0 ruling Wednesday reigns in Evers’ partial veto power.
Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote in the majority opinion that the bills “did not set aside public funds for a public purpose” but rather “created accounts into which money could be transferred to fund the programs established under Act 19 [the state budget] and Act 20, and it changed other aspects of the ‘literacy coaching program.’”
“The bill, however, does not set aside any public funds; in fact, it expressly states that “$0” was appropriated,” Bradley wrote.  
Bradley said it was within the Legislature’s authority to pass the bills in the way that it did, and the Constitution only gives the governor power to “veto in part only appropriation bills — not bills that are closely related to appropriation bills.”
“Although the executive branch may be frustrated by constitutional limits on the governor’s power to veto non-appropriation bills, the judiciary must respect the People’s choice to impose them,” Bradley wrote. “This court has no authority to interfere with the Legislature’s choices to structure legislation in a manner designed to insulate non-appropriation bills from the governor’s exercise of the partial veto power.” 
Under the ruling, the law will revert to what it was when the Legislature passed it.
Another recent state Supreme Court ruling upheld another of Evers’ partial vetoes that extended school revenue increases for 400 years, though that decision was split. In that ruling, the Supreme Court said lawmakers could avoid the partial veto power by drafting bills separate from appropriation bills. Republican lawmakers have been considering for years ways to limit Evers’ veto power, and it remains an issue of controversy in the current budget process as lawmakers pass bills without funding attached. 
Evers called the Supreme Court decision “unconscionable” and urged lawmakers to release the nearly $50 million.
“Twelve lawmakers should not be able to obstruct resources that were already approved by the full Legislature and the governor to help get our kids up to speed and ensure they have the skills they need to be successful,” Evers said in a statement. “It is unconscionable that the Wisconsin Supreme Court is allowing the Legislature’s indefinite obstruction to go unchecked.” 
Evers said he would accept the Court’s decision.
“A basic but fundamental responsibility of governors and executives is to dutifully comply with decisions of a court and the judiciary, even if — and, perhaps most importantly, when — we disagree,” Evers said. 
Evers said lawmakers failing to release the funds would be “reckless” and “irresponsible.” 
“Stop messing around with our kids and their futures and get it done,” Evers said. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said in a joint statement that the ruling is a “rebuke of the Governor’s attempt to break apart a bipartisan literacy-funding bill and JFC’s constitutional authority to give supplemental funding to agencies.”
“While the Governor wanted to play politics with money earmarked for kids’ reading programs, it is encouraging to see the Court put an end to this game,” Vos and LeMahieu said. “Wisconsin families are the real winners here.”
The end of the state’s fiscal year and deadline for getting the next state budget done is June 30, and if the money isn’t released, it will lapse back into the general fund going back to the state’s $4 billion budget surplus.
Co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) and Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said in a joint statement they plan to release the funds now that the Supreme Court has ruled on the issue
“The Supreme Court’s unanimous decision confirmed what we already knew: the Governor’s partial veto of Act 100 was unconstitutional. We are happy to see that the court ruled in favor of the Legislature as a co-equal branch of government and provided us much needed guidance,” the lawmakers said. “Now that there is clarity, we look forward to releasing the $50 million set aside to support kids struggling to read and help implement these important, bipartisan reforms. It is unfortunate that the Governor’s unconstitutional veto has delayed this funding needed by kids and families across the state.”
At a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee called for lawmakers to meet before Monday to release the funds. 
“Unless the Joint Finance Committee acts before Monday, those kids and those school districts will not see another dime. Wisconsinites are tired of Republicans playing politics with our public schools,” Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) said. She noted that Evers had requested an additional $80 million for literacy in his budget proposal, but lawmakers have so far not included that.

Republican lawmakers have approved the K-12 portion of the state budget, which includes an increase for the state’s special education reimbursement rate from about 32% to 37.5% and a 90% rate for high cost special education in the second year of the budget, along with funding for other priorities. Democrats and education advocates have been critical, saying that the budgeted amounts are not enough to ease the financial burdens public schools are facing.
Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said Democrats haven’t heard from Republican lawmakers about working on the budget.
“We are ready to work,” Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said. “We would like to see immediately some action on the funding that is going to disappear if it’s not spent by June 30th, particularly the literacy funding. The Joint Finance Committee has also refused to release other funds, including $125 million to combat PFAS and $15 million to support Chippewa Valley hospitals.
Roys said it was “great to hear” that the co-chairs said they would release the funds and that she hopes he “stands by his word.” 
State Superintendent Jill Underly also urged the release of the funds, saying part of the compromise struck by Evers and lawmakers was “to provide districts with funding to implement new strategies and change practices” and districts have been working to implement the literacy changes but have yet to see funding.
“It is devastating that despite bipartisan agreement on how to proceed, we have been stuck in neutral,” Underly said. 
Peggy Wirtz-Olsen, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council (WEAC), the state’s largest teachers’ union, said in a statement that Republican lawmakers are “bent on using schools as pawns for political payback” and are giving “lip service to literacy, while leaving educators without funding to do our job.” 
“On the cusp of another state budget, these same politicians again threaten to underfund public schools instead of working across the aisle for the good of students,” Wirtz-Olsen said, adding that WEAC will continue to advocate for funding from the state.

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)Cherokee County is the latest county to announce a deal for a new data center, adding to the growing fleet of the energy gobblers across the Palmetto State.
Texas-based Cielo Digital Infrastructure has pledged to invest $2.1 billion in a data center campus with four 400,000-square-foot buildings near Gaffney in South Carolina’s Upstate. The center is expected to open by the end of 2028 and employ 30 people.
“This project not only brings cutting-edge technology to our region but also creates high-quality jobs and long-term economic growth,” Cherokee County Council Chairman Tim Spencer said in a statement.
The center joins previously announced centers including a $2.8 billion investment by NorthMark Strategies in Spartanburg County, an $800 million center in Aiken being developed by Facebook parent company Meta, a $1 billion QTS data center under development in York County, a pair of Google data centers in the Lowcountry, and four DC Blox data centers — two operating and two under development — around the state.
These centers house rows of computer servers needed to keep ever-advancing artificial intelligence and other technology humming. But they also use vast amounts of energy, with larger centers requiring upwards of 200 megawatts each.
SC’s state-owned utility enacts higher rates for data centers, large users

John Hoffman and his wife, who were wounded.The resolution, sponsored by Rep. Kelly Morrison, who represents the suburban Minneapolis district where the Hortmans lived, also condemned political violence. Each of the seven other members of Minnesota’s bipartisan U.S. House delegation cosponsored the legislation and spoke in support on the House floor this week.No House member spoke against the resolution during brief floor debate Tuesday. It passed 424-0 Wednesday, with eight members not voting.Morrison, a Democrat, urged her colleagues to view the attacks as a “wake-up call” to tone down violent political rhetoric.“The escalation and normalization of violent rhetoric and political violence have gone way too far, and we as elected representatives have to take the lead and be the first to speak out and to start to model a better path forward,” Morrison said. “Let's make this the moment where we unequivocally condemn and commit to ending violent rhetoric, full stop. We have to make this horrific act of targeted political violence a watershed moment for our country.”Rep. Pete Stauber, a Republican, said by targeting elected officials, the gunman attacked democracy.“Make no mistake: This was not just an attack on the Hortman, Hoffman families,” Stauber said Tuesday. “This was an attack on the state of Minnesota and our shared ideals as Americans. Political violence such as this threatens the very fabric of our constitutional republic and can never be ignored or met without condemnation.”June 14 shootingsMelissa and Mark Hortman were killed in the early morning of June 14 by a man impersonating a police officer.The suspected killer, 57-year-old Vance Boelter, arrived at the Hortman home after shooting John and Yvette Hoffman in their home and visiting the homes of two other Democratic lawmakers, according to police, who also said they found a list of other elected officials in Boelter's car.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz described the attack as “a politically motivated assassination.”Police captured Boelter on June 15 after a nearly two-day search. He faces state and federal murder charges.Melissa and Mark Hortman and their golden retriever, Gilbert, who also died after being shot in the attack, will lie in state at the Minnesota Capitol on Friday.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican who was shot in a targeted attack during a baseball practice eight years prior, also spoke in favor of the resolution Tuesday.“As someone who's experienced political violence firsthand, this brings back a lot of emotions,” Scalise said. “The man who shot me on the ballfield that day also had a list of lawmakers.

(Photo by Washington State Standard)Washington is facing a housing emergency. On that point, leaders from across the political spectrum can agree. 
During my time as a state lawmaker, I was proud to co-sponsor legislation to raise the minimum wage, bringing Washington wages closer to a true living wage. But even the highest minimum wage possible isn’t enough to keep up with today’s runaway housing costs. 
Today, a household with two full-time workers each earning the minimum of $16.66 an hour would be unable to comfortably afford a typical modest one-bedroom rental, an analysis by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found. The cost of shelter has outpaced wages for years, forcing families to make impossible choices. 

According to a 2024 Washington State Housing Finance Commission and Washington State Department of Commerce report, nearly half of Washington renters are rent-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income just to keep a roof over their heads. 
There’s no question that Washington needs bold action. But to solve this crisis, we have to address the real causes and resist the urge to focus on convenient scapegoats. 
At the heart of the problem is a long-term shortage of housing. That is why, just weeks ago, Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a slew of new bills to make it easier to build in this state — because more housing supply is what ultimately reduces housing costs. Still, much more needs to be done. 
For decades, zoning laws and permitting delays have made it difficult to build enough homes to keep pace with our population. Washington has made some important strides recently, including new legislation to allow more multi-unit housing in single-family zones. That law was a meaningful step toward reversing exclusionary zoning and opening the door for “missing middle” housing options like duplexes and fourplexes. 
But zoning reform is just the beginning. We also need to speed up permitting timelines and reduce unnecessary red tape, especially for affordable and workforce housing. When it takes years to get a project approved, costs go up and fewer homes get built. Nonprofit developers and public-private partnerships in particular need faster paths to bring affordable housing online. 
Washington also needs to invest more consistently in long-term affordability. Our state Housing Trust Fund is a powerful tool, but it can’t meet current demand without increased funding and better coordination across regions. We should also provide support to community land trusts, nonprofit housing providers, and cooperative housing. This will keep homes permanently affordable and these types of organizations are rooted in the communities they serve. 
Unfortunately, some recent policy proposals risk distracting from these urgent priorities. For example, there has been a growing push in the Legislature to restrict or even ban rent-pricing software, a type of technological tool that landlords sometimes use to analyze local market conditions and estimate their rental rates.
But as Colorado’s Democratic Governor Jared Polis made clear when he vetoed similar legislation in May, these systems don’t create the state’s housing shortages or the nation’s economic inflation; they only report on how those issues are affecting the marketplace. When there’s more housing demand than supply, prices go up with or without software.
Blaming a software algorithm for housing unaffordability is like blaming a thermometer for a heatwave. In fact, these tools can sometimes help landlords respond more quickly to changing market conditions, lowering rents when demand softens and giving developers more confidence to build where homes are needed most. Banning the use of these digital tools won’t make rent cheaper — it will just make the housing market less efficient and less predictable.
Solving Washington’s housing crisis will require all of us — local officials, state lawmakers, developers, advocates, and neighbors — to focus on what works. That means building more homes, protecting renters, modernizing outdated policies, and using data and innovation to guide smart growth. The stakes are too high for distraction or delay. Let’s keep our eyes on the real problem — and the real solutions Washington families need.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/housing-apartment-construction-olympia-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 17:06:34.781018

(Photo by Shelby Wyatt for Source NM)Even though state lawmakers have allocated billions of dollars in the last few years to improve access to health care, New Mexicans’ physical and mental health outcomes have remained the same or worsened, health officials and legislative analysts say.
A higher proportion of New Mexicans of all ages had substance use disorders in 2024 compared to the prior year, and more young people had major depressive episodes, according to data cited in a presentation by Legislative Finance Committee Analyst Eric Chenier and New Mexico Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo.
While fewer women in New Mexico are dying during or shortly after pregnancy, more children are being born with low birth weights and withdrawal symptoms from being exposed to drugs while in the womb, according to data cited in the presentation.
As for access, fewer people are actually going to doctors’ offices than before the COVID-19 pandemic, but more people are seeing mental health practitioners, the data show. The report notes that it relies on utilization data that only shows if providers billed for more services, not necessarily if more Medicaid patients are receiving care.
New Mexico ranks 16th in access to behavioral health care overall, Armijo told the Legislative Finance Committee at its meeting in Taos on Wednesday.
“We’re not at the top, but it shows the interventions are working,” she said. “The state has really done a lot of work to rebuild the behavioral health system. We’re struggling with a new set of issues, in many ways, that weren’t present a decade ago.”
Medicaid
The New Mexico Medicaid program operates as the largest payer of health insurance in the state, covering approximately a third of the state’s population, Armijo said.
According to the presentation, Medicaid is “the greatest lever available to the state to reduce the prevalence of mental illness and substance use disorders and improve physical health for women and children.”
Approximately 4,000 new health care providers have joined the Medicaid network in the last 11 months, Armijo said. Of those, 57% work as behavioral health providers and 29% are in primary care, she said.
Lawmakers most recently increased provider reimbursement rates to 137% of the rate paid by Medicaid, Armijo said.
New Mexico has paid out $2.2 billion in reimbursements to health care providers, Chenier said, including $1.3 billion to hospitals and $90 million to behavioral health providers.
New Mexico has put approximately $550 million in one-time funding for behavioral health services, LFC Analyst Eric Chenier said.
Armijo said the Medicaid unwinding at the end of the public health emergency for COVID-19 resulted in the number of people enrolled in the program to drop from more than 1 million to approximately 839,000. She said the rolls are “leveling off” and are not growing.
Less than 5% of New Mexicans who lost Medicaid during ‘unwinding’ switched to private insurance

Primary care
Primary care is an entry point for behavioral health because it is the most likely setting where someone will actually receive behavioral health services, Armijo said. Primary care providers can prescribe medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorder, for example.
Among all U.S. states, New Mexico ranks 29th in access for primary care services, according to data in the presentation.
“It’s not where we want to be, but [it’s] not the worst,” Armijo said.
The network of primary care providers has grown every year, Armijo said, and nearly every provider in the state received a raise because of lawmakers’ reimbursement rate increase that went into effect in January.
For future discussions, Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) asked about a way to gather data on how long it takes for new patients to see a primary care provider versus existing patients, and how that breaks down between urban and rural parts of New Mexico.
How the ‘one big beautiful bill’ could play out
Because of Medicaid’s outsized influence in New Mexico’s health insurance market, the federal tax and spending legislation under consideration by Congress would impact not only Medicaid recipients but all New Mexicans, Armijo said.
New Mexico would lose $2.8 billion in federal medicaid funding under the reconciliation bill, she said.
The legislation would result in 111 health care providers losing funding, Armijo said, and the potential closure of between six and eight rural hospitals.
Almost 90,000 people would lose Medicaid because of work requirements and other requirements proposed in the bill, she said.
People on Medicaid are often working a minimum wage job, she said, while others are elderly or disabled who can’t just go out and find work.
“When you have people who are working, and new work requirements, you have to be very careful about how you’re administering that: You don’t want people losing it because of administrative hassle,” Armijo said. “Work requirements can be confusing to comply with.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-25 20:53:24+00:00,CT Mirror,UConn trustees debate enrollment as a solution to budget shortfall,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/25/uconn-budget-deficit-student-enrollment/,"To help close UConn’s deficit, leaders are looking to enroll more students from outside CT — but that could create new problems.","Facing a budget deficit and decreasing number of high schoolers graduating in Connecticut, leaders at the University of Connecticut are questioning how far the school can expand its enrollment without compromising its ability to serve students. 
Administrators have laid out plans to trim the system’s budget, but they also need to raise revenue. Neither will be simple.
In a message to colleagues on Monday, President Radenka Maric said the university and the UConn Health system were facing a $134 million budget deficit over the next two years, driven mainly by a shortage in funding from the state. She warned that the university would need to take steps to reduce costs, including hiring freezes and potential layoffs or non-renewals of temporary employees. 
The university had faced a $72 million shortfall for the coming year, but higher revenues from tuition and dining have pared that back to $38 million, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Geoghegan said at a meeting of the Board of Trustees on Wednesday. That’s still a significant gap to be mitigated.
University leaders said they see enrollment expansion as a potential way to close the gap. About 57% of UConn’s revenue comes from tuition.
Nathan Fuerst, Vice President for Student Life & Enrollment at UConn, told Board of Trustees that the university had increased its student body by 2,000 students over the last decade. In order to continue and boost that growth, he said, the school would need to enroll more out-of-state and international students, in part because the number of high school graduates in Connecticut hasn’t been growing. 
Out-of-state and international students also bring in more revenue because they pay more in tuition. The university has a goal of increasing enrollment from about 25,300 students as of fall 2024 to 28,000 students by 2027.
Out-of-state enrollment at UConn has already been trending up. According to data from the university, the percentage of students at UConn from outside the state has increased from 16% in 2021-22 to 26% this coming year 2025-26. Maric said that 2025-26 will be the first time that the percentage of students from Connecticut will fall below 70% — to 68%. 
The percentage of international students, however has remained relatively stable over the past five years — around 6% or 7%. And Maric raised concerns at a Tuesday meeting of the financial affairs committee that actions by the federal government could lead fewer international students to enroll. She referenced the federal government’s recent pause in scheduling visa interviews, which was lifted last week. 
Fuerst told the board Wednesday that the university received 64,000 applications for its freshman class last year. The incoming class numbered about 6,500 students across the campuses.
He added that the university is developing a plan for enrollment that focuses on more than just bringing in first-year students. For one, he said, the university wants to increase its retention rate for first-year students from 92% to 94%.
He said while students continued applying to UConn because of the positive experiences they had, the experience wasn’t uniform across the university. “[Students] come here, they have a good experience and they graduate on time and they’re successful in finding good jobs — high-paying jobs. But that’s not a universal experience. Our Pell [Grant] students don’t experience that same rate of success. Our underrepresented minority students don’t experience the same rate of success. Our regional campus students don’t experience the same rate of success, and so we need to acknowledge that,” Fuerst said. 
Provost Anne D’Alleva said the university was also looking at expanding its offerings to meet demands of graduate and nontraditional students, with programs offering online graduate certificates, microcredentials and specific professional development skills training. 
Maric said the university had managed to retain 600 students this past spring who were planning to drop out, either because of academic struggles or the inability to afford tuition. But to do so cost the university $1 million. 
More enrollment, more challenges
At Wednesday’s meeting, the trustees cautioned against increasing enrollment without ensuring that the increase aligned with the university’s goals and its ability to serve those students. 
“[Increasing enrollment] is extraordinarily important because of the budget situation. But it’s not so clear how we’re going to achieve that without decreasing student quality,” said Timothy Folta, a professor in UConn’s School of Business. “We’ve got increased competitors. We’ve got increasing alternatives to education, declining population of the high school graduates. So it’s not particularly conducive to the strategy of increasing.”  
Board of Trustees Chair Dan Toscano agreed, saying that growth needed to depend on capacity in the classrooms, housing and student support services. 
“I, for one, keep thinking about what is the purpose of growth,” said Toscano. “Growth is frequently a sign of a healthy organization. But you can also manufacture growth that’s actually quite damaging …  I think the further you get from this campus, the easier you think, ‘We’ll just take another thousand students,’ or ‘Take more out of state students, and that brings you more revenue,’ ‘Take more international students.’ And I just think we have to be a lot more thoughtful of those topics.” 
Chris Vials, a professor of English at UConn and president of UConn’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, expressed skepticism about the university’s strategy of increasing enrollment as a way to raise revenue. He said that if the university did not plan on hiring additional professors, the increased class sizes would diminish the quality of classes, making it difficult to hold discussions and discouraging students from speaking. 
“I don’t really see a plus to just bigger class sizes, and most students don’t either,” he said.  
Housing shortages have also been a sore point recently at UConn, with the university announcing to students this spring that it would no longer guarantee housing for upperclassmen. The university has been attempting to expand its housing options for students across its campuses. 
Fuerst said during his presentation that the university needed to ensure that enrollment growth was matched by the capacity for the university’s programs to serve students. 
Maric said in order to mitigate the budget for 2025-26, the university had elected to close the deficit using one-time payments out of the university’s fund balances. Governor Ned Lamont has urged the state’s higher education institutions — particularly the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities System — to use their reserves to shore up any holes in their budgets.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Governor Ned Lamont, said in an email that the legislature had increased the block grant amount for UConn and UConn Health by 20% in 2026. He said the university was warned that federal Covid-19 relief funds and one-time state surpluses would not continue. He also said that UConn and UConn Health had $468 million combined in reserves.
“These funds now enable UConn to be on a strong glide path, by using such reserves, to make any changes to deal with structural financial challenges,” Blanchard said. 
But Maric warned in her message to colleagues Monday that much of that funding had already been earmarked for specific things and was scattered in accounts across the university. 
“Using these funds to close short-term deficits will create new financial problems that didn’t exist previously and new unmet needs throughout the institution. And if these one-time funds become exhausted, they do not automatically replenish, and structural deficits will remain,” Maric wrote in her message. 
Maric said that budget reduction strategies in the future could include things like freezes in hiring, layoff or non-renewal of temporary workers, restrictions in travel or events spending and changes to service contracts. 
The University has also been hit by the federal government’s cuts to research grants. Geoghegan warned that the amount the university receives in new grant funding in 2026 could drop as much as $200 million below 2024 levels. Maric said the university already had 48 of its research grants cancelled, at a cost of $32.5 million. She said they had been successful in getting 21 of those grants reinstated through an appeals process. 
“We are very hopeful, but hope is not a strategy, so we are very persistent,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9336-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 17:06:34.781018

Here’s what Trump’s ‘roadless rule’ repeal could do,Rachel Becker,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/06/roadless-rule-repeal-california-forests/,"The land at stake ranges from dense, remote coastal forests in the far north, to alpine conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, to Southern California’s great expanses of brush.

The land at stake ranges from dense, remote coastal forests in the far north, to alpine conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, to Southern California’s great expanses of brush. Experts dispute whether revoking the two-decade-old rule would help prevent wildfires.



The Trump administration’s plan to repeal a rule prohibiting logging and road construction in undeveloped parts of national forests would strip protection from more than 4 million acres within California’s borders. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced on Monday that she will act to rescind the “roadless rule,” developed during the Clinton administration, to allow “for fire prevention and responsible timber production” on more than 58 million acres of national forests. 
But experts are divided about whether allowing road development and timber harvest in national forests will help prevent wildfires. Though roads can aid in firefighting and fuel reduction and serve as fire breaks, roads can also mean more people — and people mean more sparks that can ignite wildfires. And some experts say timber harvests may not reduce fire severity because they can promote growth of more flammable fuels in forests.
California has more national forest acreage than any state other than Alaska. At stake are the roadless reaches of wild areas throughout the state: From dense coastal forests in the far north, to alpine conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, to Southern California’s great expanses of brush in the Cleveland, San Bernardino and Angeles national forests.
The Department of Agriculture has not said how it plans to rescind the rule, and how long the effort is expected to take. Reversing federal rules usually is a long process, requiring publication in the Federal Register and a long public comment period. The agriculture department did not respond to an inquiry from CalMatters. 
California has more national forest acreage than any other state on the mainland. This map shows the roadless areas within those forests. Map via US Forest Service.
Most U.S. Forest Service land — about 69% or more than 135 million acres nationwide — isn’t covered by the rule’s protections against roads and timber cutting. In California, about 21% of its 21 million acres of national forest — 4.4 million acres — are considered roadless, ranking behind Alaska, Idaho and Montana. 
These roadless areas are considered important for providing habitat for more than 200 threatened or endangered species of wildlife, including owls, salmon and frogs, and for protecting vital watersheds.
The Trump administration says revoking the rule is a “common-sense” way to help local officials protect communities from wildfires.
“Of the 58.5 million acres of inventoried roadless areas covered under the 2001 Roadless Rule, 28 million acres are in areas at high or very high risk of wildfire. Rescinding this rule will allow this land to be managed at the local forest level, with more flexibility to take swift action to reduce wildfire risk and help protect surrounding communities and infrastructure,” according to the agriculture department’s statement.
Conservationists call this a ploy to further unfetter logging by an administration that called for an “immediate expansion of American timber production” and ordered drastic cuts to the very agencies that study and fight fires. 
“This move is the most irresponsible, because opening up these forests to logging roads and logging is going to degrade them. It’ll actually increase wildfire risks. It’ll harm numerous species and harm watersheds,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s just a big handout to timber companies.”
Sharon Friedman, a U.S. Forest Service retiree who was a planning director in the Rocky Mountain region and worked on Colorado’s state-specific roadless rule, said she could see why the announcement caused consternation, but she expects that any outcomes that survive in court will likely be long-delayed and less severe than feared. Roadways for fuel management are often temporary and, if done correctly, should bar entry to the public, she said. 
She also said she doesn’t expect that it would lead to a boom on logging in roadless areas. “It’s not like people are going to suddenly discover that, in these areas without roads, there’s a lot of desirable timber —  because if it had been there, people would have gotten to it in the first place,” she said. 
California officials aren’t ready to say what it means for the state.
David Acuña, a Cal Fire battalion chief and public information officer, said “we are simply going to respond if we’re called. Other than that, it is how they choose to handle their roads and/or fire management.”“Picture somebody attempting to redo your personal living room in your home. It would be inappropriate. In the same way, we are not going to attempt to navigate what a partner agency, a neighboring agency, does,” Acuña said.Tony Andersen, a spokesperson for the California Natural Resources Agency, said the agency is reviewing what rescinding the rule would mean for California. He would not provide further comment.

Dusty LaChapelle, an engineer with the Lake Valley Fire Protection District, which protects unincorporated communities near Lake Tahoe surrounded by national forestland, said his  department already can access remote areas in the South Tahoe basin, including with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.“We can get a hold of a lot of the fires already without having to build more roads,” LaChapelle said. “Personally, that’d be hard for me to justify going in there to punch in more roads for the possibility of a fire happening there.” Many of the fires his department fights are caused by people — often, a campfire.Multiple studies have found that roads actually seem to concentrate the risk of wildfires — increasing it up to four-fold in forest areas with roads compared to those without, according to an analysis by the Wilderness Society.  And the fires that people spark tend to spread faster and kill more trees. 
“We can get a hold of a lot of the fires already without having to build more roads. Personally, that’d be hard for me to justify going in there to punch in more roads for the possibility of a fire happening there.” DUSTY LACHAPELLE, LAKE VALLEY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT 
LaChapelle said he could see the benefit of removing dead and diseased trees, including those damaged by bark beetle infestations. But, he said, “there’s fuels reduction, and there’s logging. If you get in there and thin out some of the forest, then that’s certainly beneficial. But clear cutting — yeah, it will reduce fire risk, because there’s not going to be any trees to burn.” Matt Dias, president and CEO of the California Forestry Association, said the timber industry supports the repeal. Dias has previously called for more funding for fuel breaks to combat wildfires, and said that the roadless rule is part of a landscape of environmental rules and regulations that limit forest management. Still, Dias said, “the roadless rules in California, as far as I know, were not a significant impediment.” He said “most of the areas” where the timber industry is working with the Forest Service on fire management  “are not in areas that would be considered roadless.” The roadless rule already allows for roads to be constructed or reconstructed to protect health and safety when threatened by wildfire. And it allows for smaller diameter timber to be removed to improve habitat and reduce the risk of severe wildfires.
“There’s a sustainable economy out there — and those logs need to go somewhere. We believe that rescinding the roadless rule will be a good thing, but it needs to have tribal input.” RUSSELL “BUSTER” ATTEBERY, KARUK TRIBE CHAIRMAN 
The Karuk Tribe, which has ancestral lands in Klamath and Six Rivers national forests, also supports rescinding the rule. Tribe Chairman Russell “Buster” Attebery said burned, downed and hazardous trees should be removed. “There’s a sustainable economy out there — and those logs need to go somewhere,” Attebery said. “We believe that rescinding the roadless rule will be a good thing, but it needs to have tribal input.” Attebery and his father worked in the timber industry for decades. It was an economic driver for the region, but also a source of environmental damage. “They had one thing on their mind. They didn’t care whether they covered over the creeks and streams that fed the rivers. They didn’t care if they blocked them or muddied them,” Attebery said. “You have to put ecology first, and then the economy will follow.”
U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, a Democrat representing Northern California coastal communities and parts of Trinity and Six Rivers national forests, said the revision would threaten watersheds that provide clean drinking water, the rights of tribes and local communities, and the power of forests to hold onto climate-warming carbon. 
It “puts millions of acres of forests on the chopping block to serve (President Donald Trump’s) billionaire cronies in the mining and logging industries.” 
But U.S. Rep Doug LaMalfa, a Republican whose district includes Modoc and Klamath national forests, said in a statement that the roadless rule has “done more harm than good in the West” and repealing it is “a major step toward restoring common-sense forest management.”
Even as the Trump administration pushes for more logging, its tariff policy has “created anxiety and uncertainty” for the timber and forest products industry, according to one financial analysis. In California, wildfires, high costs, low income and reduced use of wood products are destabilizing the industry, which saw a 25% drop in softwood sawmill capacity in recent years.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/092624_Lake-Tahoe-Fire_MG_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-25 17:06:34.781018

(Provided/AmplifiedAg)COLUMBIA — Beginning next month, inmates at South Carolina’s women’s prison will be able to receive agricultural training and a stipend upon release with the help of a statewide grant program.
The South Carolina philanthropy Power:Ed announced a $97,000 grant this month to the nonprofit Impact Justice, which is working with the state Department of Corrections to run the agricultural program at the state’s prison for women.
Beyond growing an expected 48,000 pounds of lettuce each year for the prison’s kitchens, the program is meant to train women in the fast-growing field of hydroponics, which means growing plants in water instead of soil, to help them get jobs soon after leaving prison.
Starting July 7, between 15 and 20 women incarcerated at Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution will begin a five-month course on food safety, agricultural technology and hydroponics, both in a classroom and through hands-on work, said Kelly Danner, who leads the program for California-based Impact Justice.
The first group of women will start work at an existing prison greenhouse while construction continues on the eight containers that will house the prison’s vertical farms. With $350,000 in state money and $850,000 from a private donation, the prison system got the initial go-ahead on the project in 2023.
The 9-foot-tall, 8-foot-wide containers should be ready for use this fall, Danner said.
Once a woman who has completed the program leaves prison, she will receive a $1,450 stipend for the training she’s already completed. That will equate to receiving the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for an estimated 200 hours of work she did while in prison.
That “should hopefully be a meaningful amount to help get them on their feet when they’re released,” Danner said.

A job using the skills each woman learned while incarcerated will hopefully be soon to follow, as a program manager coordinates with local agricultural businesses to help find the women steady employment, Danner said.
The grant, which was part of the $1 million Power:Ed distributes annually, will help cover the stipends, the program manager’s pay and food safety certifications for women in the program, said Claire Gibbons, executive director of Power:Ed, which is based in Columbia.
Impact Justice, through its Growing Justice program, will also help coordinate transportation, child care and housing for women in the program to ensure they’re able to get to work, Danner said.
“It’s not enough for us to offer robust training and place them in jobs if then they can’t sustain those jobs,” Danner said.
The ultimate goal is to keep the women from reoffending and going back to prison, as can often be the case when a person with no safety net leaves prison and finds themselves right back where they were before, if not worse off, Danner said.
That was a key reason Power:Ed decided to help fund the program. As the philanthropy arm of SC Student Loan Corp., Power:Ed looks for programs that bolster access to education and pathways to employment, which this program does, Gibbons said.
“Savings that meet basic needs, like housing, food, and support for children is the key to reentry success for women and enables a successful job placement and retention,” Gibbons said in a news release. “We hope it will become a workforce development model that can be replicated across South Carolina.”
The one-year grant from Power:Ed will help cover the costs for Impact Justice, which currently has enough money to fund the program for at least three years.
South Carolina already touts a low re-incarceration rate for recently released prisoners. Fewer than 1 in 5 inmates return to prison within three years of release, which is the lowest among states that report three-year recidivism rates, according to an annual report from Virginia’s prisons agency.
‘They change each other’: For 20 years, SC inmates have helped train racehorses

State prison officials have credited the state’s job training and work programs with playing a large part in helping reduce its re-incarceration rates. Among those are other agricultural programs that teach inmates to train horses, milk dairy cows, tend row crops and harvest honey.
California-based Impact Justice is working to establish a similar program at a prison in Chowchilla, California, by the end of the year. Also in the works is a growing program to train people who have recently been released from prison in vertical farming, according to its website.
South Carolina’s program will be the first vertical farm on a prison’s campus in the country, state officials have said.
While the state offers other job training and reentry programs for inmates, Impact Justice’s goal is to create a more comprehensive service that could potentially expand to other prisons across both the state and the country, Danner said.
“Growing Justice is really a triple win,” said Alex Busansky, founder and president of Impact Justice, in a news release. “We’re equipping incarcerated women with the skills they need to thrive in a high-tech environment, seeding the South Carolina job market with new, qualified talent and delivering fresh produce to prison kitchens that typically lack access to locally grown fruits and vegetables.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AmplifiedAg-Container-Farm_Butter-Lettuce_Interior-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 17:06:34.781018

(Photo by Austin Fisher/Source NM)The Trump administration is planning to make it easier for employers to hire temporary migrant workers, U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told attendees Tuesday afternoon at the Western Governors’ Association annual meeting in Santa Fe.
Chavez-DeRemer said due to the backlog of temporary work visa applications, she is establishing “an emergency agency” within her office to process the work permits “on the spot.”
The move comes as the administration resumes immigration raids at farms, restaurants and hotels, despite having previously said those would decrease due to concerns about worker shortages.
Chavez-DeRemer said she will be working with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State and the Department of Agriculture “to understand the exact needs,” because as it stands, a work visa application must go through all three agencies.

“That’s where the hangup happened,” she said. “We’re going to do one dedicated, one-stop shop as I call it … and have a live dashboard to see exactly when those permits will be done.”
Chavez-DeRemer said she is often asked if visa applications can be done more quickly and cost less.
“Labor costs are always the highest in any business, and our farmers and ranchers know that food security is national security,” Chavez-DeRemer said.
Chavez-DeRemer told the governors the work visas for specialty occupations; temporary agricultural workers and temporary workers in industries like hospitality, landscaping or construction “are very important to a lot of your respective states and our rural communities.”
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat and the association’s outgoing chair, said the temporary work visas are critical to the agriculture sector. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said most western U.S. states have significant agriculture industries that rely on migrant workers.
“I would love for Americans to want to do those jobs,” Cox said. “None of the Americans I know want to do some of these jobs.”

Cox expressed approval of Trump’s immigration agenda so far and asked Chavez-DeRemer for more information about changes to the visa system.
“I think we’ve all agreed that we need to stop illegal immigration and fix legal immigration, and get that piece right, and this sounds like a huge step forward in fixing that second piece,” Cox said. “I appreciate that the president is fixing the first piece — and we feel much better about where we are there — but that second piece of streamlining those visas, getting workers in here and doing that could be very key.”
The Department of Labor on Friday stopped enforcing a Biden-era rule that protected union organizing activities among temporary farmworkers. Chavez-DeRemer said the rule harmed farm employers and made it harder for them to hire people.
Chavez-DeRemer said the work visa changes will “come across fairly rapidly.”
“They want a solution, and they wanted it yesterday, and now we’re finally going to lean in,” she said.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican elected at the end of 2024, said the law around H2A visas, which permit people to do temporary or seasonal agricultural work, hasn’t changed since he was elected to Congress in 2018.
“There’s not been a single law passed but it’s a lot harder to get an H2A worker in 2024 than it was in 2018,” Armstrong said.
Later, Chavez-DeRemer said her department will work with Congress “on the longer-term issues of immigration reform as it needs to be addressed.”

SPRINGFIELD – Attorney General Kwame Raoul announced this week he has joined another multistate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s decision to withhold billions of dollars in federal funds that had previously been approved for states and other grantees.

The complaint, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, challenges several actions the administration has taken since Trump returned to office Jan. 20 that involved terminating federal grants that had previously been approved by various agencies.

Each of those actions, the lawsuit argues, were based on a misuse of a single clause in one regulation under the federal Office of Management and Budget. That clause allows agencies to terminate a grant if the agency determines the award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”

“The Trump Administration has claimed that five words in this Clause — 'no longer effectuates . . . agency priorities’ — provide federal agencies with virtually unfettered authority to withhold federal funding any time they no longer wish to support the programs for which Congress has appropriated funding,” the lawsuit alleges.

The suit is one of more than a dozen Raoul has joined as part of a coalition of Democratic attorneys general who have been battling the administration since Trump’s second inauguration in January.

Speaking Monday to a congressional panel made up of Democratic members of the U.S. House and Senate judiciary committees, Raoul joined three other members of that coalition to explain their litigation campaign.

“Whether or not I disagree with President Trump on his policy agenda, he must act in a lawful way that is consistent with the Constitution and the laws that Congress has enacted,” Raoul said. “Unfortunately, the president and his administration have chosen, with many of their actions, to ignore the Constitution and federal law. And when constitutional guarantees are ignored, all Americans are at risk.”

Grants affected by cuts

The lawsuit challenges three specific funding cuts that have directly affected the state of Illinois. Those include:


The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision in March to halt reimbursements under the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program, which provided funding for nonprofit organizations to buy locally grown food products from farmers for free distribution to vulnerable communities.
A decision by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to terminate two Shelter and Services Program Grant awards to the Illinois Department of Human Services totaling $29 million. The money was intended to reimburse Illinois for the cost of providing food, shelter and medical care to migrants whom the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had released to relieve overcrowding at federal detention facilities.
And a decision in May by the U.S. Department of Labor to terminate grants totaling $28.8 million to the Illinois Department of Employment Security for modernization of the state’s unemployment insurance system.


According to the lawsuit, OMB first adopted the regulation in 2020, near the end of the first Trump administration. At the time, according to the Federal Register, the agency said the clause was intended to allow agencies to end a grant program under specific conditions, but that it was not intended to let them terminate grants “arbitrarily.”

The clause was later updated to include its current wording in 2024, near the end of Joe Biden’s administration. However, according to the complaint, “OMB never suggested, in either the 2020 or 2024 rulemaking, that a grant could be terminated even though the grant was continuing to serve the very goals for which the monies had initially been awarded, merely because the agency’s priorities shifted midway during the use of the grant—let alone with no advance notice.”

As of Wednesday, the case had not yet been scheduled for a hearing.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A bill restricting when Montanans can register to vote — including eliminating most of Election Day — would disproportionately affect Indigenous peoples living in rural parts of the state, according to new court documents filed on Tuesday. 
The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Blackfeet Nation, the Fort Belknap Indian Community, and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, as well as tribal advocacy nonprofit Western Native Voice, filed to join the lawsuit brought last month by the Montana Federation of Public Employees before Lewis and Clark County District Court, which challenged the constitutionality of Senate Bill 490 and another bill that strengthened voter ID laws. 
The new law, sponsored by state Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka, tightened the deadline for voters to register to vote to noon on Election Day and eliminates registration on the Monday before an election, but opens it on the prior Saturday, which previously was not a day voters could register. 
In the motion to intervene, the Native American coalition said the suit marks the third time in six years that Western Native Voice and some of Montana’s sovereign tribal nations have gone to the courts to challenge the “Legislature’s continued insistence on making it more difficult for Native Americans in Montana to vote. ” 
“Each time we’ve stood up in court for our right to vote, we do so not for ourselves, but for the generations who came before us and those who will come after,” Fort Belknap President Jeffrey Stiffarm said in a statement.  “Our ancestors fought for recognition, sovereignty, and dignity. It’s racism to try and enact the same laws over again. We will not let the state drag us backwards or silence our people. Not now. Not ever.”  
Under previous Montana law, anyone in line at the ballot box by 8 p.m. on Election Day could register to vote, which has occasionally led to long lines at voting locations. 
Last November, some voters waited in line at the Gallatin County Courthouse until the early hours of the morning in order to register and cast their ballot. 
Cuffe, in an opinion piece published by Lee Newspapers, cited that example — when votes were cast as late as 4 a.m. — as a reason for passing his bill. 
“The intent is to smooth out the process and avoid votes being cast many hours beyond the intended closing of the polls at 8 p.m.,” Cuffe wrote. 
But a 2024 decision from the Montana Supreme Court struck down a 2021 law that had sought to eliminate Election Day voter registration, which the initial legal complaint from MFPE cited and the motion to intervene focused on as well. 
“Past efforts to limit Election Day voter registration impermissibly interfered with the right to vote,” according to court documents filed by the tribal advocates. “On notice from its own legal analysis that the planned legislation likely did not conform with the Montana Constitution, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 490, which does away with eight critical hours of voter registration on Election Day.”
The Native American groups joined the lawsuit because restricting Election Day voter registration disproportionately affects Native American Voters. Citing the Supreme Court opinion, their filing states that Native voters “‘rely on Election Day registration because of numerous issues they face in voting, including lack of access to mail, transportation, and the long distances to county seats where they can register.’”
Indigenous people in rural tribal communities “rely heavily on Election Day registration, but also overwhelmingly register to vote after noon— precisely the window SB 490 cuts out,” according to the press release. 
“We are not asking for special treatment—we’re demanding equal treatment,” Northern Cheyenne President Gene Small said. “When you live miles and miles from the nearest polling place, and the roads are snowed in all morning, taking away eight hours of Election Day registration creates real-life problems for everyday voters. It’s anti-democratic.”

Darryl Rouson in Tampa on June 25, 2026. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Tampa Bay area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson was surprised to learn Wednesday that a substance abuse center located at the University of South Florida (USF) is going to be named for him, after all.
The state Senate passed a bill on mental health and substance use disorders this year that included a provision naming the center after Rouson, but the House stripped that section from the bill before passing its version of the legislation.
“It was a well-kept secret, and I was absolutely elated and surprised,” Rouson told the Phoenix after learning during a bill-signing ceremony that the center would bear his name after all.
The bill (SB 1620) was one of two measures signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis at the USF Health building in downtown Tampa. The legislation strengthens Florida’s Mental Health Act by codifying recommendations made by Florida’s Commission on Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder in January, a panel that Rouson served on.
The bill also establishes the Center for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Research at USF’s Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute to conduct statewide behavioral health research, promote evidence-based practices, and improve workforce development.

‘A travesty’

When his colleagues in the Senate passed the measure in April, they included an amendment sponsored by Pinellas County Republican Ed Hooper to rename the center after Rouson, who has battled drug and alcohol addiction in his past and had sponsored the measure in the Senate.
However, the House took that amendment out of the bill, with Speaker Daniel Perez later saying calling it “a means of emotionally blackmailing the House into doing what they want,” which he labelled “unconscionable.”
Rouson’s colleagues from both sides of the aisle condemned the House’s move at the time, with two Republicans calling it “a travesty.”
DeSantis said Wednesday that his office had worked with the Senate and USF officials to get Rouson’s name back on the center.
“We’re proud that Darryl has become an example of overcoming substance abuse but also has been very passionate about helping others who may be in similar predicaments,” DeSantis said. “I know that they were trying to get this into statute, and there was a little bit of a hiccup on that, but you know, it was a period of a lot of hiccups. That’s just the way it is.”
Among the changes to Florida’s Mental Health Act included in the new law are:

Defining person-first language to mean that language used in a professional medical setting must emphasize the patient as a person rather than his or her disability or illness, and requiring use and promotion of person-first language as the standard in professional behavioral health settings.
Requires that individualized treatment plans for adults and juveniles be reevaluated at least every six months.
Requires the Department of Children and Families to conduct biennial reviews and the Agency for Health Care Administration to prioritize licensing for short-term residential treatment facilities in underserved counties and high-need areas.

‘A pathway to peace’
Rouson, who turns 70 next month, has served in the Florida Legislature since 2008. He has one more year in his state Senate seat before being term-limited in 2026.
“I’m absolutely honored,” he said about having the center named after him. “The work is hard work and it must continue, and I’m just elated that they saw fit to honor my body of legislative work and the passion that I’ve had in this process for those who suffer from addictions and mental health challenges. It’s all about creating a pathway towards peace.”
DeSantis also signed the “Tristin Murphy Act” (SB 168). The measure creates model processes for diverting defendants to mental health treatment. Senate President Ben Albritton and Northeast Republican Jennifer Bradley, the bill’s sponsor in the Senate, also spoke at the press conference celebrating the signing of the legislation.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Matunuck Oyster Bar will welcome diners to slurp oysters and sample seafood in a makeshift, outdoor space across the street from its acclaimed restaurant starting July 1, Perry Raso, restaurant owner, announced Wednesday.
The reopening of the acclaimed South County dining destination on its 16th anniversary  comes less than two months after a fire forced the restaurant to close. Ahead of a permanent rebuild, Raso cooked up a temporary solution relying upon the marina parking lot across the street from his restaurant.
The tented dining space required sign-off from state and local officials to ease restrictions governing outdoor eateries. The Rhode Island General Assembly unanimously approved changes to state regulations on June 12, clarifying that pandemic-era allowances for al fresco dining also extend to restaurants closed due to floods, fires or other disasters.
Separately, the South Kingstown Town Council OK’d details including operating hours, parking plans and capacity caps for “Matunuck Marina,” Raso said in an emailed statement.
He thanked state and local officials for helping revive the famed seafood restaurant overlooking Potter Pond, allowing 50 of his 300-person staff to keep working over the summer.
The revival includes tableside dining and grab-and-go options, preserving the existing reservation and takeout system via the restaurant website. 
The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal. A preliminary investigation suggested it was accidental, and not caused by commercial cooking equipment.

Ted Nugent was in the house on Wednesday – the Michigan House of Representatives, that is – to rail against state Department of Natural Resources conservation and hunting regulations he deemed “immoral” and “insane.”
Meanwhile, several Democrats who were present for Wednesday’s joint meeting of the three separate House committees that hosted Nugent, said it was shameful that other important work was cast aside to give Nugent a podium to rail against officials of a state agency, whom he at one point referred to as “jackbooted thugs” and the enemies of conservatism.
Nugent, a hard rock guitarist and avid sportsman who became a conservative firebrand in the latter part of his career, was invited by state Rep. Ken Borton (R-Gaylord) to testify before the members of the House Natural Resources & Tourism Committee, the House Rural Development and Natural Resources Committee and the House Oversight Subcommittee on Weaponization of State Government.
Rep. David Martin (R-Davison), one of three chairs for the meeting, said it was his intention to use the hearing to shine a light on alleged recent abuses by DNR officials. The meeting followed the Oversight subcommittee’s recent hearing on a decade-old invasive species order issued by the DNR surrounding feral pigs and allegations that the department was running covert enforcement against pig farmers and game ranch owners.
Nugent’s visit to the Capitol and ensuing commentary focused on various instances where he ran into trouble with the DNR, its conservation officers and game wardens throughout his time of owning a 340-acre, fenced-in hunting area near Jackson.
To that, Nugent told the cadre of legislators and onlookers that he hopes what they heard “pisses you off, because everybody that comes up to me is just livid that the DNR and the [Michigan Natural Resources Commission] have chased families out of the sport over absolutely insane anti-nature, anti-science regulations.”

Nugent also ran afoul of the DNR regarding alleged feral pigs when the department sued him and others in Ingham Circuit Court, to which he countersued in the Court of Claims and lost there. Nugent’s main argument was that the order on feral pigs – specifically related to so-called Russian boar – was invalid and unlawful. The case in Ingham Circuit Court was closed in May.
Still, Nugent had plenty to say about the DNR and how they allegedly treat hunters in Michigan, which the guitarist said was a reason why hunters were leaving the state in droves. His comments stretched over 10 minutes, during which he stood the entire time, but with his mesh sheriff’s star ballcap removed while speaking.
“We were the number one conservation state in the nation,” Nugent said, adorning a short-sleeved button-up shirt, cargo pants and camouflage Crocs. “More family hours of recreation, more revenues generated and more opportunities to optimize the wildlife biodiversity battles. … And now, Michigan is the laughing stock of the nation. There’s no place I go where families don’t come up to me with horror stories of being given a ticket because [they] have a salt block on [their] farm.”
Nugent said it was important to “set the table” because there were “people in this room that were stupid enough to listen to the lying, anti-hunting media,” who he claims have falsely accused him of being in violation of DNR regulations. He went on to defend himself and other hunters accused of the same.
“I abide by the law before I go deer hunting, I buy a deer license. I examine where I can deer hunt with what weapon,” Nugent said. “My dad raised me in the discipline of conservation, marksmanship, safe gun handling and the perfection of venison as the healthiest diet in the world.”
He went on to claim that chronic wasting disease regulations were based on a “lie,” claiming that the disease affecting deer can’t jump to humans. Nugent previously testified in 2019 against a ban on deer and elk baiting that had been issued to prevent further spread of chronic wasting disease, a fatal neurological illness that affects members of the deer family, namely the white-tailed deer in Michigan.
While there have been no reported cases of the infection in people, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the disease “may pose a risk to people” and recommends that infected animals not be consumed as food by either humans or domestic animals.
Whitmer kills Nugent-backed deer baiting bill

Nugent also claimed that the DNR and the Michigan Natural Resources Commission have abdicated their “moral duty” by violating hunters’ rights on wasting disease regulations.
He also called the people in the department and on the commission “insane,” claiming the regulations have run good hunters out of the state.
“There were 11 counties that were forbidden to hunt on Sunday,” Nugent claimed in a particularly loud portion of his commentary. “Who is the man that can intervene between God’s nature and my recreational sporting spirit, [my] connection to the good Earth, that can tell me that, somehow, mysteriously, the hunting season ends when the sun goes down on Saturday. That’s insane.”
Nugent went on to call for legislators to do away with game laws that he and others testifying before the committees on Wednesday said were based on junk science for the sake of regulation and not for protection of people and wildlife.
Borton has had his own seemingly negative interactions with the DNR. Borton said that the DNR cited him in 2010 for a birdfeeder with a livestream he operated near his home, dubbed by Borton and his wife as a “snowman cam.”
It was alleged that the department falsely claimed the birdfeeder was an illegal bait pile for hunting deer. Borton said he contested the alleged government overreach and eventually won. He has since been calling for decreasing the scope of the DNR’s regulatory authority.
Borton controls the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the department’s budget, and Wednesday’s hearing seemed like a precursor to a potential scaling back of the department’s enforcement funding.
The Oversight subcommittee’s chair, state Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), also called on residents to testify following Nugent on allegations that DNR agents used fake names to hunt privately owned pigs on northern hunting grounds. The aim, they claimed, was to kill and seize them without compensating their owners.
Dems and others call foul on Nugent free-for-all hearing
At one point during the meeting, state Rep. Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park) was given an opportunity to speak and chided House Republicans for hosting Nugent and the hearing when they had a budget to pass.
The GOP-led House has passed its public and higher education budgets but has yet to pass a budget funding the rest of the state government and its agencies. The Democratic-led Senate, however, has passed its total budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year and is eager to start negotiations.
“I appreciate the passion of the testimony and concern around law and order,” Weiss said. “I’ve got to say, I feel really emotional, really upset, because I’m a mother and a teacher and the fact that we’re sitting here talking about salt licks and feral pigs when we are a month away from a deadline to get a budget passed. … I think it’s shameful.”
Weiss was almost immediately cut off, with several of her Republican colleagues jeering, grumbling and saying, “oh shut up,” as Weiss continued to call the proceedings shameful.
Following the meeting, state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) agreed with Weiss’ assessment and questioned Nugent’s use of the word immoral to describe hunting regulations given the content of some of his music and lyrics.
“We have submitted school aid budget that we could be negotiating on, and just frankly, I’m not interested in being lectured about morality by somebody who sang about raping 13 year olds,” Pohutsky said, referring to the lyrics of Nugent’s song titled Jailbait. “It’s absurd.”
That point was echoed by Sam Inglot, Progress Michigan executive director, who issued a statement noting the controversies in Nugent’s past.
“Ted Nugent has a long, documented history of promoting racism, misogyny, violent political rhetoric and election denial. Nugent’s past also includes deeply disturbing allegations of grooming and abuse that should disqualify him from being legitimized by Michigan Republicans. His presence at today’s Natural Resources hearings is not only offensive, it’s dangerous,” Inglot said.

According to annual crime data collected by the FBI, Waterbury’s violent crime rate tends to be lower in areas like robbery, rape and aggravated assaults. 
But Waterbury has trended slightly lower or the same as Bridgeport in the number of homicides, like in 2023 — the last year in which FBI data is available — when they both reported 18. 
In other years, the cities’ numbers can vary widely. In 2021, Waterbury recorded 9 homicides, while Bridgeport recorded 20.
New Haven, meanwhile, often records more homicides than both Waterbury and Bridgeport. In 2021 for example, it reported 26. In 2023, it reported 22.
But another city tops New Haven, and all other Connecticut cities, in the number of homicides — the capital city of Hartford. It had 37 homicides in 2023, 40 in 2022 and 41 in 2021.

Spencer Cox sit for a panel discussion on post-fire flooding, an issue affecting many Western states. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Several governors of Western states on Tuesday endorsed formalizing a partnership to help each other deal with the aftermath of increasingly devastating wildfires, citing the long-term effects of post-fire flooding and also uncertainty about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s future.
Governors from New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado attended a panel discussion on the topic of post-fire flooding at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe. The governors questioned experts — including state emergency response officials and a government landslide scientist — at a discussion called “Flood After Fire – Enhancing Safety in Post-Fire Landscapes.”
The governors described the phenomenon as increasingly urgent due to wildfires burning hotter and larger across the West. High-severity wildfires can change soil composition, converting even modest rainstorms that fall on burn scars into potential floods or debris flows.
In New Mexico, for example, post-fire flooding has impeded the recovery from the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, both for the City of Las Vegas as it tries to rebuild its water treatment facility and for smaller communities in and around the 534-square-mile burn scar. Other Western governors, including Spencer Cox of Utah, said they’re increasingly concerned about flooding after fires. That was the case when Cox came across the aftermath of a fire that burned this week.
Las Vegas to get $98 million to replace water treatment facilities after 2022 wildfire damage

“The first thing I thought when I drove into that community had nothing to do with the fire or the homes burned,” he said. “What I realized was, for the next five or six years, things are going to be pretty awful for those people because of the mudslides and the runoff, the sediment that comes down.”
The conversation occurred as at least six wildfires burn across New Mexico, and as burn scar areas in northern and southern New Mexico experience severe flooding or are warned to be on high-alert for it.
While no FEMA official sat on the panel, the agency’s past performance with post-fire flooding and its future loomed over the meeting. Participants mentioned the agency’s name more than 10 times, and speakers noted the challenges they’d face if the agency is dismantled, as called for briefly by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
While New Mexico’s United States Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján say the agency should still exist, they recently called on FEMA to change the way it deals with post-fire flooding. The agency has “repeatedly struggled to respond effectively” to second-order effects from wildfires, including “cascading disasters such as landslides, flooding and water system failures that compound damage and slow recovery,” the senators wrote.
NM’s U.S. senators to Noem: Reform FEMA. Don’t scrap it entirely.

Collin Haffey, a Washington post-fire recovery leader who worked for New Mexico Forestry Division during the 2022 wildfires here, spoke on the panel and said there’s a “tremendous amount of uncertainty” about the federal government’s role in wildfire recovery going forward.
“If I’m trying to build my portion of the railroad track to meet them, I don’t know how far to go,” he said. “And I think that that lack of communication down to the local level is putting lives and recovery at risk.”
So he called on the WGA to create a formal agreement between Western states, one that could help states help each other deal with the aftermath of devastating wildfires amid uncertainty about what type of aid could come from the federal government.
“We have these peer-to-peer networks because I have their cell phone numbers,” Haffey said. “But that’s not necessarily the best.”
In response, Cox, who on Tuesday was named the new WGA chair, said he would spearhead an effort to create a regional partnership.
“Even if we weren’t, you know, seeing FEMA reform and changes happening there, we should have been doing this anyway,” he said. “And so let’s do it anyway.”

Regent Dennis Casey and Chancellor Sean Burrage listen from their desk. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Over half of Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities on Wednesday asked a state governing board to approve increases in what students must pay in tuition and fees for the upcoming school year. 
Mark Tygret, vice chancellor for budget and finance for the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, said the average tuition and fee increase request across institutions was 1.9% which equates to just over $121 for undergraduate resident students enrolled in 30 credit hours. 
In all, 15 institutions are seeking increases while 10 did not request any boosts in tuition or fees, including Oklahoma State University, which will be its sixth year without an increase.
The state regents are expected to vote Thursday to approve or deny the requests.
Many presidents attributed the need for increases to inflation, rising health insurance costs and a desire to provide cost of living raises for faculty and staff. 
University leaders also highlighted the ways they’ve tried to cut costs in other places before requesting increases in tuition or fees. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a press conference earlier this month that he didn’t think tuition increases were necessary as Oklahoma hasn’t seen “all of the efficiency out of our universities.” 
Tuition or fee increases were requested from University of Oklahoma, East Central University, Northeastern State University, Northwestern Oklahoma State University, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, University of Central Oklahoma, Langston University, Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College, Connors State College, Western Oklahoma State College, Oklahoma City Community College, Rose State College, Seminole State College, and Murray State College. 
The Oklahoma Legislature appropriated $1.1 billion to the state Regents for next fiscal year, which is about $80 million more than the current budget year. 
OU President Joseph Harroz said he’s requesting an increase to keep up with inflation and universities in Texas and Florida that receive more legislative performance-based funding.
He requested a 3% increase, which raises costs about $294 for a full-time student.
“You’ve seen me up here the last three years, and under our strategic plan … that request will be coming again next year and the following year, with the same goals,” Harroz said of requesting an increase again. 
While OU’s “sticker price” for tuition has risen 12% since the 2019 fiscal year, the average amount actually paid by students is down 27% in the same time period when factoring in financial assistance, Harroz said. 
A 2.6% increase, totaling a $225.90 change, was requested by UCO President Todd Lamb.  
The university is continuing to recover from a budget deficit, and if approved this increase could bring the school close to closing the gap completely, he said. 
The Edmond school is the third-largest university in the state, but third to last in funding, Lamb said. 
Oklahoma’s only historically Black university, Langston University, requested a 3% increase. 
Langston President Ruth Ray Jackson said the revenue generated will provide funding for capital projects spurred by weather-related damage, deferred maintenance and help with inflation. 
The increase to tuition and fees would cost the average student just over $207. 
Oklahoma City Community College President Mautra Jones asked the state regents to approve an 8% increase, the highest boost sought by any institution. 
While Jones said the request may seem steep, the community college kept tuition flat for seven years. Even if the increase were approved, the college would remain “within pennies” of being the lowest cost institution in the state, she said. 
The increase equates to $323.10 for the average student.

(Photo: Angela Dennis)A grand jury in Knox County has indicted University of Tennessee protesters who participated in on-campus demonstrations more than a year ago, protesting Israeli actions in Gaza.
At a hearing in June 2024, Judge Judson Kyle Davis acknowledged the courage of the demonstrators but stated that his role was not to make a decision driven by emotions. 
“All I have to consider is the statute of criminal trespassing. There have been some good arguments that were obviously very well studied, and some of those arguments are hard for me to disagree with, but it’s not something for me to consider,” Davis said. I think it’s more of a jury question.“ The Knox County District Attorney’s office sent the case to a grand jury in June 2024, and indictments were issued on June 18, according to attorney Dillon Zinser, who is representing one of the plaintiffs.
According to records from the Knox County Sheriff’s office, seven of the 12 protestors indicted are scheduled for arraignment on July 16 and July 22 in Knox County Criminal Court and are charged with criminal trespassing, a class C misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $50 fine. The others are still awaiting court dates, according to Zinser.
Zinser said District Attorney Charme Allen’s office showed a significant delay in waiting a year before bringing the cases before a grand jury and could have chosen to dismiss each of the cases. 
“We believed and hoped that perhaps they would do the right thing,” Zinser said. “But now that they’ve chosen to indict, that’s a signal to all of us that they are deciding to prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law.”
He also said that they plan to fight the charges. 
“None of our clients want to plead guilty because they don’t believe they broke the law, and we don’t believe they broke the law,” said Zinser. “So we will be seeking a jury trial. It looks to me that this was content-based discrimination, and these demonstrators were targeted for their political views, which are unpopular with the government.” 
Attorney Mike Whalen, who is representing five of the protesters indicted, said he was stunned by the decision to move forward with charges nearly a year after the arrests.
 “The idea that they would just let these things sit in the grand jury for a year before they bring it out it’s ridiculous. It just makes no sense.”
He also questioned the motivations behind the delay, suggesting outside influence may have played a role. 
“I guess, like everything else in the era of Trump, the message they’re trying to send is that the First Amendment is dead,” Whalen said.
What led to campus arrests
On May 15, 2024, the group of protesters, including university students and community members, were arrested during a pro-Palestinian rally at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, held in observance of Nakba Day.
Nakba is the Palestinian commemoration of the date the Israeli Declaration of Independence was signed and displaced Palestinians before and after Israel’s establishment in 1948. The word “Nakba” means “catastrophe” in Arabic and refers to the loss of Palestinian homes, land and livelihoods as a result of the war.
Demonstrators urged the University of Tennessee to take action, including cutting ties with Israeli weapons manufacturers, halting study abroad programs in Israel, publicly disclosing its financial investments and divesting from companies connected to Israel. They outlined their demands on a sign displayed during the campus demonstrations.
A Tennessee law enacted in 2022 that bans unauthorized camping on public property has had a chilling effect on demonstrations across the state, including those at college campuses like the University of Tennessee.
Before the May 15 arrests, nine pro-Palestinian protestors were arrested on May 2, 2024, for violating the university’s policy on the use of outdoor facilities for authorized events. In response, UT later permitted the group to reserve the Student Union lawn for future demonstrations, provided they adhered to the university’s established guidelines on time, place, and manner. Under those rules, the group was allowed to occupy the space daily between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.
However, according to university statements, some protestors were taken into custody more than an hour before the May 15, 2024 designated end time, following repeated instructions from campus officials to leave the premises.
Pro-Palestinian activists file federal lawsuits against UT, sheriff’s office over First Amendment violations
Two of the protesters who were arrested last year also filed a federal lawsuit against UT in May 2025, claiming the school violated their First Amendment rights during the campus demonstration last year. 
Plaintiffs Layla Soliz and Hasan Husain said the university used its policies to unfairly target and silence pro-Palestinian speech.
The lawsuit argues that the university enforced its outdoor event rules in a way that was not content-neutral, and that disciplinary actions and trespass warnings issued to demonstrators, some of whom were community members unaffiliated with UT, were retaliatory. The plaintiffs are seeking a court injunction to prevent future restrictions on similar protests, a formal acknowledgment that their rights were violated, and monetary damages.
Soliz also filed a lawsuit against the Knox County Sheriff’s Department for violating her religious rights when deputies removed her hijab during the booking process after the campus arrests in May, and later releasing her mugshot publicly. She was awarded $71,500 as a settlement in the suit in March.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Legislators in the Maine Senate and House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to sustain the five vetoes issued by Gov. Janet Mills so far this session, including a measure that would have prohibited the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use.
Before taking up LD 958, House lawmakers debated whether the bill was “a solution in search of a problem,” as the governor contended, or whether it is a “fundamental matter regarding sovereign governments,” as Rep. Adam Lee (D-Augusta) put it. 
House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), who sponsored the bill, said he put in the bill “so the state could not use eminent domain to take other people’s property.” He added, “The needs of society never make it okay to take other people’s property.”
Passamaquoddy Tribal Rep. Aaron Dana said that the concern expressed by some of his colleagues that the tribes would block the construction of power lines and highways was unfounded. 
“The tribes are still going to allow that, because we need access to those same infrastructures,” he said. “We just would like to protect and have a stronghold on what 1% of lands we have remaining here in what we call the state of Maine, which was traditionally all Wabanaki Nations’ lands at one point.”
Ultimately, the House voted 77-63, falling short of the two-thirds of support needed to override a veto. 
Vetoed legislation only needs to return to the chamber in which it originated, so members of the House also took up LD 1328, which sought to create culturally appropriate and trauma-informed housing recovery residences for underserved or underrepresented individuals. Without discussion, they voted 40-100 against overriding the veto of that bill.
The Senate voted 18-14 to sustain Mills’ veto of legislation (LD 588) that would have protected the right of farmworkers to discuss working conditions. 
Mills’ veto of LD 1802, which would have created a statutory right to counsel at state expense for indigent defendants because there is a risk upon conviction that the accused may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, was also sustained in the Senate by a vote of 3-28.
The Senate then voted 16-16 to override the governor’s veto of legislation (LD 1731) that would require the state ferry service to consult with an advisory board on matters related to the service, budget, strategic planning and major operational decisions.

Shelley Moore Capito’s office in Charleston, W.Va. on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)Six people were arrested Wednesday afternoon at West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito’s office in Charleston, West Virginia, as they attempted to protest proposed federal cuts to food assistance and health care programs. 
Seven people came to Capito’s office in the United Bank building in downtown Charleston to urge Capito to vote no on the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” — legislation being debated by the Senate that analysts say would make historic cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provide health care and food assistance to thousands of West Virginia residents.  
The group found that the office was closed to the public, they said in a news release. When they called the office, they were denied a chance to arrange a meeting, they said. One person apparently left before the other six were arrested.  
According to a news release, the Charleston Police Department charged the six with trespassing. They included Charleston City Council members Beth Kerns and Joe Solomon along with activist and a long-time episcopal priest Jim Lewis. Community members Lyn May, Paul Dalzell and Morgan Fowler were also arrested. The news release said police responded to a trespassing complaint and that the people were asked to leave but refused. 
“My little girl depends on Medicaid,” Fowler said in a statement Wednesday. “My aunt survived a stroke, but if these Medicaid cuts go through, she won’t have a pathway to survive at all. Senator Capito claims to care about West Virginia, but this bill would cut health care for our babies so billionaires can buy bigger boats.”
Outside the building, about a dozen more people gathered holding signs with messages against the proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. 
John Doyle, a retired Charleston resident, held a sign that warned said “SNAP saves Lives. Hands Off.” Doyle said the bill would do tremendous harm to West Virginia in particular.
“I’m particularly concerned about Medicaid, SNAP and other human services that are going to be slashed,” Doyle said. “This is a state where that whole economy —  health care, is the major employer in West Virginia. If they don’t think this is going to affect the whole state, they’re wrong.”
Charleston Councilwoman Chelsea Steelhammer was also among the people protesting outside the building. Steelhammer said she’s motivated to protest by her work as a teacher. 
“My students — a lot of them depend on Medicaid and SNAP,” Steelhammer said. “If they don’t have health care, they’re sick and they don’t learn. If they don’t have food, they’re hungry and they don’t learn. And if you don’t learn, you don’t succeed.”
Steelhammer said if she could talk to Capito, she would tell her to listen to her constituents. 
“Just think about what’s going to happen to these kids,” she said. 
Capito and Sen. Jim Justice, both Republicans, have expressed support for adding work requirements to Medicaid. 
In a statement Wednesday afternoon, Capito said that everyone should have the right to make their voices heard in a respectful and peaceful way. She defended the proposals to cut SNAP and Medicaid. 
“The Medicaid and SNAP provisions included in the reconciliation bill that the Senate is currently considering focus on managing and maintaining the programs for those who are eligible and intended to be in them,” she said. “Our goal in the bill is to root the waste, fraud and abuse out of the programs, to ensure that it is sustainable for the long term.”

Scott and legislative Republicans have long pushed for exempting military pensions from income taxes. This year, lawmakers in all parties signed on to a significant exemption.

Phil Scott does the honors during a ceremonial bill signing. The new law creates tax exemptions and tax credits starting this tax year for veterans, families, low-income workers and retirees. Photo via the office of Gov. Phil Scott.
Gov. Phil Scott signed a tax credit package on Wednesday that is projected to provide $13.5 million in breaks for low-income workers, families, veterans and retirees.
“This exemption isn’t just about tax breaks, and as you can see by who’s here today, it’s not a partisan issue,” Scott said at the bill signing, surrounded by Republican, Democratic and independent lawmakers. “It’s an important recruitment tool.”
Supporters of S.51 argue the credits will keep more people in Vermont, particularly military retirees, who often begin a civilian career after leaving the uniformed services. 
For years, Scott has pushed for a complete exemption of military pensions from state taxation. But skeptical Democratic leaders argued the tax break would unnecessarily benefit some high-income households and unfairly single out one deserving group over all others. 
This legislative session, however, the concept drew bipartisan support among rank-and-file lawmakers in both chambers. And after a first version of the tax credit bill moved through the House without the military pension-focused measure, lawmakers later struck a compromise that significantly expanded veteran tax credits. 
Wednesday, Scott was joined by military retirees and survivors to celebrate the law. 
“This exemption will give a little lift to those who need it most,” said June Heston, the surviving spouse of Brig. Gen. Michael Heston, who served in the Vermont National Guard. 
Effective retroactively, S.51 will expand tax breaks for all of 2025.
Breaking down the tax breaks 
The law will exempt military pensions and military survivor benefits for households with adjusted gross incomes under $125,000, and create a partial exemption for those making less than $175,000. 
Vermont remains among a minority of states that doesn’t fully exempt military pensions from income taxes. 
S.51 also creates a $250 refundable tax credit for low-income veterans — not just those with military pensions — making less than $25,000, with a partial credit available for those making less than $30,000. According to the Joint Legislative Fiscal Office, 5,200 veterans are expected to be eligible. 
While the veteran-related credits have drawn the most political attention, they make up less than a third of the cost of the overall package. 
The largest change proposed is raising by one year the age threshold for Vermont’s child tax credit, to include families with 6-year-olds — a $4.5 million loss of revenue, according to the Joint Legislative Fiscal Office. Households making under $125,000 will receive $1,000 per eligible child. 
Vermont’s earned income tax credit — linked to the federal initiative of the same name — would also expand under the law to include workers without children. The credit benefits lower-income working individuals and households. 
Some retirees can expect new benefits as well. S.51 will raise the income thresholds at which Social Security is fully or partially tax exempt by $5,000 — up to $55,000 for single filers and $70,000 for married filers. Vermont is one of just nine states that tax Social Security, according to the joint fiscal office.

DemasThe Michigan state Senate passed a handful of gun regulation bills on Wednesday including a ban on bump stocks and ghost guns, as well as legislation that would put Capitol rules banning firearms into state law.
All the bills passed without Republican support in the tightly partisan state Senate, except for the ban on bump stocks, which enhance the speed of semi-automatic firearms, making them effectively fully automatic. Three Republican state Senators joined Democrats in supporting the ban on bump stocks under Senate Bill 224, which had previously been federally banned after the 2017 concert mass shooting in Las Vegas which resulted in the deaths of 60 people, injuring hundreds of others.
“Whether they shoot for sport or self-defense, civilians have no need for a device that allows them to shoot hundreds of bullets in a matter of minutes,” bill sponsor Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia) said in a news release Wednesday. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Bump stocks are designed for one purpose only — to inflict maximum carnage in the shortest amount of time. By prohibiting this deadly device, we’re sending a clear message: Michigan will not stand by while tools of mass violence threaten our communities and our sense of safety,” said Polehanki.
The Michigan Senate also voted through a ban on firearms that can be constructed with a kit or other parts without valid serial numbers, also known as “ghost guns”, which pose difficulties for law enforcement tracing weapons to perpetrators.
The ban outlined under Senate Bills 331 and 332 would prohibit the sale, possession and distribution of ghost guns, with maximum criminal penalties of up to 5 years in prison.
Denise Wieck, a volunteer lead with Moms Demand Action and a gun violence survivor, said her son was badly injured with a ghost gun when he was 17 and suffers the consequences to this day. 
“Today, Michigan Senators sent a clear message that they are committed to acting in the best interest of Michigan families and saving lives. We hope the House will follow suit and explicitly ban ghost guns. Our gun violence crisis is real and it is already here – immediate action is needed,” Wieck said in a release issued by Everytown For Gun Safety.
Senators also approved legislation Wednesday to enshrine into law rules set by the Michigan State Capitol Commission in 2023, banning all firearms from being carried inside the Capitol, unless they’re carried by members of Capitol security or current state lawmakers in possession of a concealed carry permit.
Some Democrats in the state Legislature have sought to ban firearms from the Michigan State Capitol Building and legislative offices since 2020 when armed protestors in opposition of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s COVID-19 lockdown orders came into the building demanding to go onto the floor of the legislative chamber. In 2021 the Michigan State Capitol Commission banned open carry in the Capitol Building, before placing the ban on concealed carry later on.
Senate Bills 225 and 226 would put the ban on firearms in the Michigan State Capitol except for security and lawmakers into law, as well as a ban on carrying in the Anderson House Office Building, and the Binsfeld Senate Office Building.
All of the legislation now moves to the GOP-controlled state House, where it was referred to the House Government Operations Committee, where legislation traditionally goes to die.

Holds on deportations have slowed the administration’s aggressive plans for mass deportation of people without permanent legal status, on the grounds of due process.“Every unlawful order entered by the district courts robs the Executive Branch of its most scarce resource: time to put its policies into effect,” according to the complaint. “In the process, such orders diminish the votes of the citizens who elected the head of the Executive Branch.”The complaint by DOJ argued that a standing order from Chief Judge George Russell of the District Court of Maryland is “nothing more than a particularly egregious example of judicial overreach interfering with Executive Branch prerogatives—and thus undermining the democratic process.”In late May, Russell signed a standing order to halt deportations for two days in an effort to accommodate the sudden high volume of habeas corpus claims filed outside of normal court business hours. A habeas corpus claim allows immigrants to challenge their detention.The Trump administration argues that the order stymies federal immigration enforcement and acts as a preliminary injunction or temporary retraining order without meeting the threshold and is therefore unlawful.“Inconvenience to the Court is not a basis to enter an injunction, and filings outside normal business hours, scheduling difficulties, and the possibility of hurried and frustrating hearings are not irreparable harms,” according to the complaint.The Department of Justice has also asked that the judges recuse themselves from the case, and that either the 4th Circuit hear the case or a judge randomly selected from another district.Abrego Garcia caseThe Maryland court in Greenbelt has halted several immigration-related moves by the Trump administration, with the most high-profile case handled by Judge Paula Xinis, who ordered the return of the wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was sent to a prison in El Salvador.The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. The Maryland man was brought back earlier this month, but to face federal charges on human smuggling that were filed after he was wrongfully deported and courts ordered his return.The Maryland case is still ongoing, as Xinis is allowing discovery to determine if the Trump administration refused to comply with her order to return Abrego Garcia.Another judge, Theodore David Chuang, in February partly granted a request from Quakers and other religious groups to limit the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s authority to conduct immigration enforcement in houses of worship.",,,,2025-06-25 16:08:49.101877

SPRINGFIELD —– Three main factors contribute to the formation of Midwest dust storms: strong winds, dry soil in farm fields and large amounts of loose soil.

That’s according to Andy Taylor, the Science and Operations officer at the National Weather Service’s office in Lincoln. He said these are key ingredients that meteorologists, farmers and experts in the agricultural community have found cause dust storms when they converge.

On May 16, Chicago saw its first major dust storm since the Dust Bowl, which stretched from Texas to New York in the early 1930s and deposited 300 million tons of soil across the nation – 12 million tons of which settled in the Chicago region, according to the Bill of Rights Institute. The storm in May dropped visibility in the city to near zero as wind gusts blew over 60 mph at times, according to the National Weather Service.

Taylor said the atmospheric environment that day was more characteristic of the dry environments in the High Plains or Southwest U.S., not the Midwest. As rain began to fall near Bloomington, it quickly evaporated and cooled the atmosphere, creating strong pockets of wind that began to move North. And as winds sped up, the storm began to pick up and move dry and loose soil from fields it passed over, which created the dust storm.

“The type of dust storm event that we had that affected the Chicago area, I wouldn’t necessarily take that occurrence as saying we’re going to see an increase in those type of events from this point on,” he said. “Although, anytime you see all those ingredients come together, we certainly could see that again.”

Soil conservation funding ‘deprioritized’

While there were no deaths due to the storm in Chicago, a major dust storm that occurred in central Illinois on a portion of I-55 resulted in a multi-car pileup that took the lives of eight people and injured dozens more in May 2023.

That dust storm also dropped visibility to zero on the stretch of the interstate between Farmersville and Divernon, and was again caused by dry, loose soil being picked up and moved by winds.

Although Taylor said dust storms are not new to Illinois – as his office has documented events back to the 80s – most of the storms don’t move across vast expanses of the state. Instead, he said they often occur in more localized areas, like the storm near Divernon in 2023.

“When we’re seeing the right weather-related factors coming together and the ground is fairly dry, which matches up with loose soil so we know we’re going to be more prone to blowing dust, we coordinate with partners in the agricultural community to determine when we might anticipate those blowing dusts events,” Taylor said.

The Association of Illinois Soil and Water Conservation Districts has been lobbying for increased funding for additional district employees. This year’s state budget allows for each district to staff one full-time employee, which AISWCD Executive Director Eliot Clay called “wildly inadequate” as he said each district needs at least two.

“I really, honestly think conservation funding has been deprioritized,” he said.

What do soil and water conservation districts do?

Soil and water conservation districts began to crop up across the U.S. in the late 1930s as a response to the Dust Bowl and Congress’ subsequent declaration of soil and water conservation as a national priority. According to the Association of Illinois Soil and Water Conservation Districts, that declaration prompted then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt to recommend legislation to state lawmakers that would enact districts in every state.

Illinois has 97 districts, or nearly one district for every county in the state. Employees of the districts are responsible for a variety of tasks – including assessing farmland, educating farmers about conservation practices and connecting farmers with grants from the state and federal government. These all play a key role in the association’s mission of protecting Illinois’ natural resources.

“Unlike a group like the Department of Natural Resources or the EPA or even the Department of Agriculture, SWCDs are not a regulatory body,” Clay said. “We are not going out there and enforcing rules and laws on people, we’re just trying to help farmers do better. And that’s the reason why a lot of farmers rely on SWCDs, is because they do not see us as like, the ‘government’ coming in and telling them, ‘this is how you’re going to do your operation.’”

Soil conservation funding stagnates

The fiscal year 2026 budget signed by Gov. JB Pritzker last week allots $7.5 million to the state’s SWCDs – which Clay said is the same amount the association received in the previous fiscal year. However, he said that number was a $1 million cut from the FY24 budget allocation.

Of that $7.5 million, $3 million will go to cost-share grants, which act as reimbursements to farmers for the costs of implementing both state and federal conservation policies, such as cover crops. The remaining $4.5 million will go to administrative costs.

Clay said the breakdown of that $4.5 million provides $40,000 to each Soil and Water Conservation district – meaning that every district will have enough funds to pay one full-time employee. He called the salary “wildly inadequate” for the district employees, most of whom have college degrees.

“$40,000 – and that’s supposed to include benefits, so their take-home is less than that – is barely enough, I mean I would say it’s not enough even for one person” Clay said. “And it’s hard to keep people and incentivize people to come to work when there’s not the kind of money there that there should be.”

In addition, Clay said each district needs two full-time employees to be fully-staffed – one to make on-site visits to farms and one to coordinate schedules, receive phone calls and emails, and staff the office.

He said in recent years, the association was told by both the Department of Agriculture and the governor’s office that if they wanted more funding, they would have to advocate for the money to individual lawmakers outside of budget negotiations.

“I don’t know of any other agency or subsect of an agency that has to, on their own, go to the Capitol and get money,” he said. “That’s very peculiar to me and is something I’ve been trying to wrap my head around, and I have not gotten a good explanation from anybody.”

The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

Over the past two years, Clay said the association unsuccessfully lobbied for $10.5 million in annual funding.

“The bigger question I’m left with after being the executive director over the past six months and witnessing it from this angle is, what does the legislature and the administration value?” Clay said. “It really gets to bigger questions about how the state has dealt with conservation funding in general for the last 20-plus years.”

Soil conservation efforts and farming practices

Kevin Brooks, a commercial agriculture educator at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said the agriculture community has identified practices farmers can use to reduce the amount of dry, loose topsoil in their fields.

“Measuring the humidity level as a cause is not the issue,” Brooks said in an interview with Capitol News Illinois. “I won’t say it's not 100% not about the weather, but this is primarily about tillage.”

One suggestion he made was for farmers to till their fields less frequently and instead resort to strip-tilling or using no-till strategies whenever possible to reduce the amount of loose topsoil in fields.

Strip-till is a tilling practice where only narrow rows of a field where seeds will be planted are tilled, leaving the rest of the field untouched. While there are many short- and long-term benefits to strip-tilling, no-till practices often don’t seem to benefit farmers right away but do often have long-term advantages, Brooks said.

Rep. Charles Meier, R-Okawville, farms 1,500 acres in southern Illinois with his family, including corn, wheat, beans, hay, and beef cattle. He said most crops are already minimally tilled by farmers.

“I’m 66 years old and we never no-tilled when I was a kid,” he told Capitol News Illinois. “All of our conventional soybeans are no-tilled now, all of our wheat is done by minimal-till, and our corn is all by minimal-till now.”

He said he’s in frequent contact with his SWCD, including a call on Monday with his district’s employee, and criticized Democratic leadership’s funding priorities, such as subsidies for renewable energy.

“They're not funding the nuts and bolts of Illinois conservation,” Meier said. “I'm not against wind and solar but they don't pay for themselves and they're making us taxpayers pay for them.”

Another main practice Brooks recommended farmers employ was planting cover crops, which are crops planted after harvest not for their produce, but for their benefits to the soil. Cover crops can be planted after a fall harvest for a variety of benefits, including to preserve topsoil through the winter, increase organic matter in the soil and dry the field earlier in the spring.

Brooks also attributed recent dust storms to the invention of high-speed discs – a tillage attachment with many more disks than normal tillage attachments, which tills at faster rates. He said these disks have taken tillage speeds from around 4 mph to over 10, and that farmers in Illinois quickly amassed these machines during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the pandemic relief funds they received.

“In theory, they’re supposed to be a kind of conservation because they don’t go into the ground very deep,” Brooks said. “But they literally turn the top several inches of a farm field into powder.”


Dust storm driving tips
Andy Taylor, from the National Weather Service, recommended safety tips for drivers who find themselves caught in a dust storm.

“If you’re caught in dust with extremely low visibility, the advice is to pull completely off the road, turn off your heads and take your foot off the brake,” he said. “Which may sound kind of counterintuitive in a way, but the reason for doing that is because if you have your lights on, people coming into the dust may think you’re moving. They may see your taillights and think ‘Oh look, someone I can follow’ and that may exacerbate accidents and pileups.”

He also advised drivers who know there is risk of a potential dust storm to travel ahead of the storm or to delay travel until later in the day, if possible.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The Trump administration is planning to make it easier for employers to hire temporary migrant workers, U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told attendees Tuesday afternoon at the Western Governors’ Association annual meeting in New Mexico.
Chavez-DeRemer said due to the backlog of temporary work visa applications, she is establishing “an emergency agency” within her office to process the work permits “on the spot.”
The move comes as the administration resumes immigration raids at farms, restaurants and hotels, despite having previously said those would decrease due to concerns about worker shortages.
Chavez-DeRemer said she will be working with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State and the Department of Agriculture “to understand the exact needs,” because as it stands, a work visa application must go through all three agencies.
“That’s where the hangup happened,” she said. “We’re going to do one dedicated, one-stop shop as I call it … and have a live dashboard to see exactly when those permits will be done.”
Chavez-DeRemer said she is often asked if visa applications can be done more quickly and cost less.
“Labor costs are always the highest in any business, and our farmers and ranchers know that food security is national security,” Chavez-DeRemer said.
Chavez-DeRemer told the governors the work visas for specialty occupations; temporary agricultural workers and temporary workers in industries like hospitality, landscaping or construction “are very important to a lot of your respective states and our rural communities.”
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat and the association’s outgoing chair, said the temporary work visas are critical to the agriculture sector. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said most western U.S. states have significant agriculture industries that rely on migrant workers.
“I would love for Americans to want to do those jobs,” Cox said. “None of the Americans I know want to do some of these jobs.”
Cox expressed approval of Trump’s immigration agenda so far and asked Chavez-DeRemer for more information about changes to the visa system.
“I think we’ve all agreed that we need to stop illegal immigration and fix legal immigration, and get that piece right, and this sounds like a huge step forward in fixing that second piece,” Cox said. “I appreciate that the president is fixing the first piece — and we feel much better about where we are there — but that second piece of streamlining those visas, getting workers in here and doing that could be very key.”
The Department of Labor on Friday stopped enforcing a Biden-era rule that protected union organizing activities among temporary farmworkers. Chavez-DeRemer said the rule harmed farm employers and made it harder for them to hire people.
Chavez-DeRemer said the work visa changes will “come across fairly rapidly.”
“They want a solution, and they wanted it yesterday, and now we’re finally going to lean in,” she said.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican and former member of the U.S. House, said the law around H2A visas, which permit people to do temporary or seasonal agricultural work, hasn’t changed since he was elected to Congress in 2018.
“There’s not been a single law passed but it’s a lot harder to get an H2A worker in 2024 than it was in 2018,” Armstrong said.
Later, Chavez-DeRemer said her department will work with Congress “on the longer-term issues of immigration reform as it needs to be addressed.”

Such burns can help reduce the risk of large wildfires. (Kyle Sullivan, Bureau of Land Management/Flickr)An executive order signed earlier this month by President Donald Trump would look to “consolidate” five federal wildland fire agencies into one.
The U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs and National Park Service all have departments that fight fires on their land.
Two federal departments oversee the effort — the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture. Trump directed them to consolidate their efforts within 90 days of the June 12 order. The Federal Wildland Fire Service would be under control of the U.S. Department of the Interior, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfire season is already underway across North America, with large fires burning in Canada and Alaska. Washington and Oregon have also begun to see fire seasons pick up, too. In Montana, several fires have flared, but only one has reached 2,000 acres in size this year so far.
U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, a Montana Republican, introduced legislation in February to combine wildland fire agencies in a bipartisan effort with U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.
“For too long, layers of senseless bureaucracy and red tape have splintered our wildfire management system, failed our brave firefighters on the ground, and let entire communities be wiped off the map by wildfire,” Sheehy said in a statement on Feb. 6. “The time is now to reshape our approach to American wildfire management and start fighting fires better, stronger, and faster.”
Sheehy, who helped found an aerial firefighting company, has been a force on legislation surrounding wildland firefighting as a freshman senator. He’s been a sponsor or cosponsor on 15 firefighting bills, including one that was recently signed by Trump that reauthorizes the sale of Department of Defense parts to repair the nation’s firefighting fleet.
Sheehy did not respond to a request for comment. However, Sheehy’s office did issue a statement thanking the president for taking action on wildfires as his repair bill was signed.
Trump’s order also cast some blame on local fire agencies, saying they “continue to disregard commonsense preventative measures.” It added that many firefighters across the country were relying on outdated equipment and were slow to respond because of “unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy.”
A fact-sheet for the order also identified how the federal government wants to modernize firefighting. It also seeks to declassify historical satellite data to help improve wildfire prediction.
“The order directs the use of available technology, including AI, data sharing, innovative mapping, and weather forecasting, to enhance state and local wildfire identification and response capabilities,” the fact-sheet said.
According to the U.S. Forest Service, about 98% of wildfires are suppressed before they reach 100 acres. The other 2% are large and often dangerous, which Andy Stahl, the director of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, describes as acts of nature in line with a hurricane or earthquake.
Large fires weren’t ever going to be stopped, and wildland fire agencies have little room to improve, according to Stahl, who also took issue with Trump’s usage of the 2025 Los Angeles fires as the “purpose” of the order.
Those fires were driven by structures burning, adding to the intensity and scope of the inferno. A total of 16,251 homes, commercial properties, and other structures burned during those fires, according to research by UCLA.
Furthermore, Stahl noted, wildfires can’t really be fought effectively in high winds — fire breaks can quickly be jumped by embers and spot fires can turn into larger blazes. Extreme fire behavior is driven by low relative humidity, strong surface wind, unstable air, and drought, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, a government agency. None of those things can be changed by firefighters.
“The executive order is mostly political posturing for the MAGA crowd, for the firefighters, you know, and, it’s just bizarre, and it won’t change anything,” Stahl told the Daily Montanan. “Nothing in this executive order is going to move that 98% needle.”
There were 64,897 wildfires reported in 2024 according to the National Interagency Fire Center and they burned almost 9 million acres. Additionally, nearly 4,500 structures were lost to wildfires last year. In 2023, the country spent more than $3.1 billion on wildfires, which is the most recent cost estimate available.
The five-year annual average suppression cost is nearly $3 billion. As a source of comparison, the country spent more than a billion dollars on suppression just once between 1985 and 2001, though those numbers are not adjusted for inflation.
The Forest Service, which did not respond to a request for comment, covers 193 million acres of land, while the Bureau of Land Management manages 245 million acres. The Department of Interior did not provide answers to questions before publication.

(Getty Images)The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously overturned a controversial earlier decision that had sent alarm through the ski industry in Idaho and nationwide, holding instead that a lower court was right to dismiss a lawsuit from the widow of a skier who died after crashing into a snowmaking tower gun at Sun Valley.
Supreme Court case shakes Idaho ski areas by overturning decades of liability precedent

However, the court, with just one justice dissenting, upheld its earlier ruling that departed from decades of precedent in Idaho in how the state’s Ski Area Liability Law should be interpreted with regard to the legal “standard of care.” That potentially opens the door to far more lawsuits over ski injuries in Idaho, rather than reducing ski area liability, as lawmakers who originally sponsored the 1979 law said they intended.
Justice Cynthia Meyer, in her dissent, wrote that the law is clear as written. “Whether it is wise or socially unsound is not for us to decide. But that is the framework the legislature enacted,” she wrote. She added, quoting an earlier Idaho Supreme Court case, “The wisdom, justice, policy, or expediency of a statute are questions for the legislature alone.”

Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, an attorney and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, declined to take up a 2024 bill from Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, to amend the law after the initial decision, saying he preferred to wait until the court’s processes were completed. 
“Let the judiciary make the decision, and then we act as necessary, if the law should be changed,” he said in February.
On Wednesday, he told the Idaho Capital Sun, “Now’s the time for our committee to at least look at possible changes, so that the law is more clear, as to what it is intended —  so that it’s easier for the courts and litigants to interpret.”
Idaho’s 2025 legislative session adjourned on April 4; unless they hold a special session, lawmakers are next set to convene in January of 2026.
“Obviously we’re pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold summary judgment,” said Brad Wilson, general manager of Bogus Basin and former president of the Idaho Ski Areas Association. “ … We won this particular piece of it, and so we’re pleased with that. But I don’t know what the implications of the rest of it is.” 
Wilson said he planned to meet with attorneys to further evaluate the new ruling.

 Milus v. Sun Valley Co. case stems from 2019 skiing accident

Justice Colleen Zahn, the author of the original 2023 decision, wrote Wednesday’s decision, and stuck with her earlier decision on several key points about the interpretation of the law. But she reversed course on a major issue: Whether the section in the law that places all risk for collisions with clearly visible, marked snowmaking equipment on the skier barred the lawsuit in the first place. The skier was the late Dr. Stewart Milus of Boise.
“We hold that Milus’ claims are barred because the record establishes that Snow Gun 16 was plainly marked,” Zahn wrote, “… and that Mr. Milus assumed the risk of injury caused by that equipment.”
The case, Milus v. Sun Valley Co., involves a November 2019 accident in which Milus hit a bright yellow-padded tower snow gun in the middle of Lower River Run at the resort in 2019, and died from his injuries. His widow, Laura Milus, sued the ski resort for wrongful death.
According to court records, Milus was skiing with “poor control” on the moderately crowded groomed run on that clear Saturday afternoon. He skied across the backs of another skier’s skis and yelled, then fell and crashed head-first into the tower, one of a row of such towers that stretches down the run.
The district court dismissed the lawsuit on summary judgment, based on Idaho’s 1979 Ski Area Liability Act. The widow appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court, which in December of 2023 overturned the lower court’s decision, offered an entirely new interpretation of the decades-old law, and said a jury should weigh whether the ski area was at least partially to blame, regardless of the skier’s actions. 
Sun Valley Resort sought reconsideration of the court’s decision, which the justices granted, hearing additional arguments from both sides in February.
 Idaho Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling could force some ski areas out of business, operators say

The December 2023 decision from Idaho’s highest court caused great consternation for Idaho’s 19 ski areas, which range from giant Sun Valley to tiny, one-chairlift mom-and-pop ski hills. If the state law doesn’t afford the resorts the liability protections it’s long been thought to provide, they said they expect to see a big increase in lawsuits, along with sharply increasing liability insurance costs. That could drive up the cost of skiing statewide, and force small resorts out of business if they can’t afford the increased costs.
That’s what happened in Vermont, after an infamous Vermont Supreme Court decision in 1978. That ruling, Sunday v. Stratton Corp., prompted most of the 37 U.S. states that have ski areas to pass ski area liability laws, many of them similar to Idaho’s. Idaho’s law has repeatedly been upheld in court since it first passed in 1979; state lawmakers affirmed their intent when they last approved amendments to the law in 2014.
Idaho Supreme Court hears arguments to reconsider ruling on ski area liability law

Idaho’s law says skiers take on the liability for the inherent risks of the sport, including colliding with trees, bare spots, lift towers, clearly visible snowmaking or snowgrooming equipment and the like. It holds ski areas liable for operation of lifts, including maintaining them to national standards, along with a list of nine specific duties such as clearly marking the level of difficulty for designated trails. 
Skiers are liable if they don’t comply with their own enumerated duties, including skiing in control and within their ability, heeding all posted warnings, and sticking to designated runs.
Idaho’s law says ski areas can’t be held to “any standard of care” for actions designed to lessen the inherent risks of skiing, meaning they can’t be sued for how well they accomplish them. A long line of decisions from the Idaho Supreme Court and federal courts has held that that applies to all nine of the enumerated duties of ski areas. 
There were three points on which the high court’s initial 2023 ruling appeared to depart from the long line of precedent in Idaho, and from the lower court’s ruling: 

It applied an “ordinarily prudent person standard of care” for judging how well ski areas carry out their nine enumerated duties under the law, rather than concluding that the law eliminated any standard of care for those duties. That’s the standard that would be applied if there were no ski area liability law.
It ruled that it should be up to a jury to decide how well Sun Valley carried out two of those duties, regarding what constitutes a “warning implement” on snowmaking equipment and whether the resort had adequately posted notice that snowmaking was “in progress” when snowmaking equipment was in place, but no snow was being made. The justices on Wednesday found Milus hadn’t provided sufficient evidence the ski area failed to meet its duties on those points.
It held that the skier’s compliance with his own enumerated duties, including controlling speed and course and heeding all posted warnings, can’t be considered until a jury decides if the resort was negligent with regard to warning implements and signs — and can’t be considered at all if the jury finds the resort failed on those points. That’s the key point that was overturned, leading to dismissal of the lawsuit.

Laura Milus attended the arguments before the court on Feb. 14, as did the general managers of three Idaho ski areas and a host of others. 
Milus said after the February arguments that she thought it was “reckless” for Sun Valley to have snow guns “right in the middle of a beginner run, where somebody is going to go out of control.” She also said then that even if she didn’t win, she hoped the case would bring attention to that issue.

In response to the court’s December 2023 decision, in February of 2024, at the urging of the ski industry, Ehardt introduced House Bill 516, adding a clear statement to the existing law that “no standard of care” applies to the enumerated duties of ski areas. 
That would put the interpretation of Idaho’s law back to where it has been since the law was first enacted, before the court’s December 2023 ruling. The bill never got a hearing.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-25 19:46:07+00:00,Mississippi Today,Jackson Police Department called ICE on Mississippi father. He now faces deportation for illegal dumping,Lili Euzet and Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/25/jpd-called-ice-on-miss-father-who-faces-deportation-for-illegal-dumping/,"ICE is seeking to deport an immigrant with work authorization for alleged ""illegal dumping"" in Jackson.","Kerlin Moreno-Orellana is facing deportation over a misdemeanor charge that usually results in a fine. He was picked up by Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents on Thursday morning and transferred from the Raymond Detention Center to an ICE detention center in Louisiana.
On June 16, Jackson police arrested Moreno-Orellana, a contractor, in south Jackson along with his employer Christy Parker, who was showing him one of the old properties she worked on. Both were charged with illegal dumping, but Parker claims they did not dump anything. 
After detaining them, Jackson police called a local TV outlet, 16 WAPT News, to come shoot the scene of the arrest. Parker said they were kept in the police car for over an hour, waiting for the news crew. The WAPT newsroom explained that the Jackson police routinely asks them to  cover arrests related to illegal dumping or other high profile cases, in order to “dissuade people.”
Once at the station, the Jackson Police Department called ICE on the 35-year-old father of four, who had worker authorization documents. He was kept in jail overnight, while Parker was released hours after their arrest.
“He didn’t do anything I didn’t do,” Parker said in an interview with Mississippi Today. “But because I’m white, I’m here?”
A municipal court ordered Moreno-Orellana’s release the day after, but ICE placed a detainer on him – a formal request to keep a non-citizen in custody for 48 hours, while the agency investigates. It is not an arrest warrant. However, a state law passed in 2016 mandates that all local law enforcement comply with ICE detainers placed on undocumented immigrants. 
“What we are doing today is no different than what we’ve always operated when the detainer is sent by ICE to the jail,” said Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones. “Nothing has changed.”
While the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department has historically worked with ICE, Jackson police actively seeking out ICE to detain people is a fairly recent occurrence, said Mississippi-based immigration attorney Jeremy Litton. Jackson police did not respond to a request for comment.
ICE picked up Moreno-Orellana with hours left on his detainer, and now faces deportation. ICE spokesperson Lindsay Williams said that Moreno-Orellana violated the conditions of a past bond agreement by being arrested for a new charge. He had already spent over a month in ICE custody in 2019, after getting arrested by park rangers for speeding and driving without a license.
Still, a minor misdemeanor charge – like illegal dumping – is normally insufficient for ICE to threaten to deport someone with worker authorization paperwork. Removal of a person with documentation is usually justified if the person is deemed a threat to public safety or national security.
“This does feel like a result of the elevated focus on deporting people from the Trump administration,” said Matt Steffey, professor at the Mississippi College School of Law.
Moreno-Orellana, who is from Honduras, has three boys and a girl, the youngest of whom is less than a year old. He has lived in Mississippi for over 16 years. Colleagues describe him as a valuable worker and a good friend.
“All he ever did was work and go home,” Parker said. “He was always willing to give somebody help.”
The possibility of his deportation is leaving his family in a precarious situation. Moreno-Orellana was the sole breadwinner of the family, and his wife worries about sustaining herself and their children without him.
“I’ve always dedicated myself to taking care of my kids at home, and he’s the one who brings food to the table,” his wife said in Spanish. “I’m afraid of staying, being without my children’s father. Not so much for me, but because they need him.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/25131417/unnamed-9.jpg,,,2025-06-25 16:08:49.101877

LaMonica McIver grabbed officers during a scuffle outside an ICE jail in Newark on May 9.,"Rep. LaMonica McIver speaks outside the federal courthouse in Newark on June 25, 2025, after she pleaded not guilty to charges related to a scuffle outside a Newark ICE jail. (Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK — Rep. LaMonica McIver pleaded not guilty in federal court Wednesday morning to a three-count indictment alleging she assaulted federal officers during a scuffle outside a Newark migrant detention center in May. 
McIver, a Democrat who faces up to 17 years in prison if convicted of the charges, told a crowd of supporters gathered outside the courthouse in the blistering heat that the charges do not intimidate her. And she warned colleagues who push back against President Donald Trump’s policies that they could find themselves in her shoes. 
“We’ve seen different cases of this administration bullying and intimidating elected leaders, from judges to anyone that gets in their way,” she said. “This is what they do, and we will not stand for it. I will not stand for it.”
U.S. District Court Judge Jamel K. Semper set a tentative trial date of Nov. 10. 
McIver is accused of “forcibly” grabbing a federal agent while authorities arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka May 9 outside Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed immigrant detention center that reopened earlier this year. McIver was there that day with two other Democratic members of Congress to conduct an unannounced oversight visit to the facility.
Federal authorities initially charged McIver on May 19 after they dropped Baraka’s trespassing charge. She was indicted earlier this month on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding, and interfering with officers. Two of those counts carry a maximum of eight years in prison, and a third misdemeanor charge carries a one-year maximum prison sentence, prosecutors said in court. 
Paul Fishman, a former U.S. attorney for New Jersey who represents McIver, said he is eager to challenge the charges and is “confident that when we are done, the legal system will vindicate the congresswoman.”
McIver spoke in court only to plead not guilty in front of a room filled with reporters and her supporters, including Baraka, a Democrat who is now suing acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba for malicious prosecution. 
“Everything that happened as a result of that is wrong from the start. It’s absolutely incorrect,” Baraka said before Wednesday’s court hearing. “The congresswoman had a right to be there.”
Habba did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Habba previously said she’s investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over a state directive banning local law enforcement from assisting in civil immigration enforcement. She has said she wants to use her office to help “turn New Jersey red.”
Under new guidance released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, members of Congress are now asked to give immigration officials at least 72 hours notice for a visit to its facilities.
McIver first joined Congress in September to represent the 10th District, which includes parts of Hudson, Union, and Essex counties, including Newark.

Meanwhile, several Democrats who were present for Wednesday’s joint meeting of the three separate House committees that hosted Nugent, said it was shameful that other important work was cast aside to give Nugent a podium to rail against officials of a state agency, whom he at one point referred to as “jackbooted thugs” and the enemies of conservatism.
Nugent, a hard rock guitarist and avid sportsman who became a conservative firebrand in the latter part of his career, was invited by state Rep. Ken Borton (R-Gaylord) to testify before the members of the House Natural Resources & Tourism Committee, the House Rural Development and Natural Resources Committee and the House Oversight Subcommittee on Weaponization of State Government.
Rep. David Martin (R-Davison), one of three chairs for the meeting, said it was his intention to use the hearing to shine a light on alleged recent abuses by DNR officials. The meeting followed the Oversight subcommittee’s recent hearing on a decade-old invasive species order issued by the DNR surrounding feral pigs and allegations that the department was running covert enforcement against pig farmers and game ranch owners.
Nugent’s visit to the Capitol and ensuing commentary focused on various instances where he ran into trouble with the DNR, its conservation officers and game wardens throughout his time of owning a 340-acre, fenced-in hunting area near Jackson. 
To that, Nugent told the cadre of legislators and onlookers that he hopes what they heard “pisses you off, because everybody that comes up to me is just livid that the DNR and the [Michigan Natural Resources Commission] have chased families out of the sport over absolutely insane anti-nature, anti-science regulations.”

Nugent also ran afoul of the DNR regarding alleged feral pigs when the department sued him and others in Ingham Circuit Court, to which he countersued in the Court of Claims and lost there. Nugent’s main argument was that the order on feral pigs – specifically related to so-called Russian boar – was invalid and unlawful. The case in Ingham Circuit Court was closed in May.
Still, Nugent had plenty to say about the DNR and how they allegedly treat hunters in Michigan, which the guitarist said was a reason why hunters were leaving the state in droves. His comments stretched over 10 minutes, during which he stood the entire time, but with his mesh sheriff’s star ballcap removed while speaking.
“We were the number one conservation state in the nation,” Nugent said, adorning a short-sleeved button-up shirt, cargo pants and camouflage Crocs. “More family hours of recreation, more revenues generated and more opportunities to optimize the wildlife biodiversity battles. … And now, Michigan is the laughing stock of the nation. There’s no place I go where families don’t come up to me with horror stories of being given a ticket because [they] have a salt block on [their] farm.”
Nugent said it was important to “set the table” because there were “people in this room that were stupid enough to listen to the lying, anti-hunting media,” who he claims have falsely accused him of being in violation of DNR regulations. He went on to defend himself and other hunters accused of the same.
“I abide by the law before I go deer hunting, I buy a deer license. I examine where I can deer hunt with what weapon,” Nugent said. “My dad raised me in the discipline of conservation, marksmanship, safe gun handling and the perfection of venison as the healthiest diet in the world.”
He went on to claim that chronic wasting disease regulations were based on a “lie,” claiming that the disease affecting deer can’t jump to humans. Nugent previously testified in 2019 against a ban on deer and elk baiting that had been issued to prevent further spread of chronic wasting disease, a fatal neurological illness that affects members of the deer family, namely the white-tailed deer in Michigan. 
While there have been no reported cases of the infection in people, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the disease “may pose a risk to people” and recommends that infected animals not be consumed as food by either humans or domestic animals.

Nugent also claimed that the DNR and the Michigan Natural Resources Commission have abdicated their “moral duty” by violating hunters’ rights on wasting disease regulations.
He also called the people in the department and on the commission “insane,” claiming the regulations have run good hunters out of the state.
“There were 11 counties that were forbidden to hunt on Sunday,” Nugent claimed in a particularly loud portion of his commentary. “Who is the man that can intervene between God’s nature and my recreational sporting spirit, [my] connection to the good Earth, that can tell me that, somehow, mysteriously, the hunting season ends when the sun goes down on Saturday. That’s insane.”
Nugent went on to call for legislators to do away with game laws that he and others testifying before the committees on Wednesday said were based on junk science for the sake of regulation and not for protection of people and wildlife.
Borton has had his own seemingly negative interactions with the DNR. Borton said that the DNR cited him in 2010 for a birdfeeder with a livestream he operated near his home, dubbed by Borton and his wife as a “snowman cam.” 
It was alleged that the department falsely claimed the birdfeeder was an illegal bait pile for hunting deer. Borton said he contested the alleged government overreach and eventually won. He has since been calling for decreasing the scope of the DNR’s regulatory authority.
Borton controls the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the department’s budget, and Wednesday’s hearing seemed like a precursor to a potential scaling back of the department’s enforcement funding.
The Oversight subcommittee’s chair, state Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), also called on residents to testify following Nugent on allegations that DNR agents used fake names to hunt privately owned pigs on northern hunting grounds. The aim, they claimed, was to kill and seize them without compensating their owners.
Dems and others call foul on Nugent free-for-all hearing
At one point during the meeting, state Rep. Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park) was given an opportunity to speak and chided House Republicans for hosting Nugent and the hearing when they had a budget to pass.
The GOP-led House has passed its public and higher education budgets but has yet to pass a budget funding the rest of the state government and its agencies. The Democratic-led Senate, however, has passed its total budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year and is eager to start negotiations.
“I appreciate the passion of the testimony and concern around law and order,” Weiss said. “I’ve got to say, I feel really emotional, really upset, because I’m a mother and a teacher and the fact that we’re sitting here talking about salt licks and feral pigs when we are a month away from a deadline to get a budget passed. … I think it’s shameful.”
Weiss was almost immediately cut off, with several of her Republican colleagues jeering, grumbling and saying, “oh shut up,” as Weiss continued to call the proceedings shameful.
Following the meeting, state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) agreed with Weiss’ assessment and questioned Nugent’s use of the word immoral to describe hunting regulations given the content of some of his music and lyrics.
“We have submitted school aid budget that we could be negotiating on, and just frankly, I’m not interested in being lectured about morality by somebody who sang about raping 13 year olds,” Pohutsky said, referring to the lyrics of Nugent’s song titled Jailbait. “It’s absurd.”
That point was echoed by Sam Inglot, Progress Michigan executive director, who issued a statement noting the controversies in Nugent’s past.
“Ted Nugent has a long, documented history of promoting racism, misogyny, violent political rhetoric and election denial. Nugent’s past also includes deeply disturbing allegations of grooming and abuse that should disqualify him from being legitimized by Michigan Republicans. His presence at today’s Natural Resources hearings is not only offensive, it’s dangerous,” Inglot said.

This year marks the ACLU of Kentucky’s 70th anniversary. In honor of the organization’s anniversary and the 10th anniversary of Miller v. Davis, ACLU-KY will host a panel discussion and reception with our former clients in Morehead from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Thursday, June 26, at Sawstone Brewery. More information is available here. 

Ten years ago, I answered that call from Morehead, Kentucky. I was the ACLU of Kentucky’s communications director at the time, and I knew immediately what April’s call meant. Without a single finger fumble I forwarded the call to our then-legal director, William Sharp, and the rest, as they say, is history.
Within hours of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Obergefell case, which enshrined the freedom to marry into law, Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis announced she would stop issuing marriage licenses to any couples, straight or gay, because of her religious objections to marriage for same-sex couples. The ACLU of Kentucky was honored to represent four couples — two gay and two straight in suing Davis. Our argument was simple: Kim Davis’s personal religious beliefs did not excuse her from doing her job: to certify that couples were qualified to marry under Kentucky law.
The case drew intense media scrutiny. Our brave clients were put under international scrutiny. While the case was being litigated all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States and back down to the district court level, Rowan County residents, known as the Rowan County Rights Coalition, organized protests in front of the clerk’s office. Every single day, they demanded that Davis do her job. A couple of governors, the band Survivor, and even the Pope were swept up in the firestorm in the months that followed.
Ultimately, love won. Our clients, April Miller and Karen Roberts, Jody Fernandez and Kevin Holloway, Aaron Skaggs and Barry W. Spartman, were able to receive their marriage licenses. Their bravery and perseverance to secure legal protection for their families, and all Kentuckians, are exemplary in the ACLU of Kentucky’s 70-year history of protecting and advancing civil rights and civil liberties in the commonwealth.

A decade after this victory, anti-LGBTQ activists and politicians are spearheading attacks against the rights of LGBTQ people to participate in public life. Many of these attacks, from statehouses to the White House, target the rights and lives of transgender people. Just this month, the Supreme Court handed down a devastating and cruel ruling, allowing bans on the lifesaving medical care transgender youth need to stay in place in half of the states in the country, including Kentucky. 
In this critical moment for LGBTQ rights, we must unite against discrimination and division. We envision a future where LGBTQ individuals thrive in safe schools, empowered communities and loving families.  
We reject the politics of cynicism that demands we silence our voices, shrink our needs, and simply give up in the face of an unrelenting assault on our rights. Inspired by our Rowan County clients, the Rowan County Rights Coalition, and in loving memory of Barry Spartman who passed away in 2022, we stand committed to a world where all people deserve safe schools, strong communities, loving families and self-determination over their bodies and future.

AI is a great tool, likely to strengthen top economic sectors in Michigan like agriculture and manufacturing, Daniel Kroth, senior researcher at the Center for AI Risk Management and Alignment told members of the state House Judiciary Committee Wednesday. But without mandates for risk management protocols, AI’s ability to problem solve and come up with solutions could lead to cyber attacks that endanger human life and the environment.
Given the mandate to win a game of chess, some advanced AI models resort to exploiting cyber vulnerabilities to hack their opponent, Kroth said. From deleting chess pieces to forfeiting the game on behalf of their opponent, AI will complete its task of “winning” a game of chess.
“Hacking to win at chess is almost funny, but it’s much less funny when our healthcare or industrial control systems are on the other side of the board,” Kroth said.
Whether bad actors use AI for nefarious purposes or AI itself makes an ultimately detrimental decision, Kroth argued there’s need for guardrails on this technology so Michiganders can experience the best it has to offer while managing the worst.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
House Bill 4668, being considered by the committee, would create the Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Transparency Act, mandating large developers of foundation models to create and implement protocols for safety and security to prevent ‘critical risk’. This means any risk that would result in the serious harm or death of more than 100 people or cause more than $100 million in damages.
The bill would require companies that spend more than $100 million a year to develop foundational models and those that have spent $5 million on an individual model to test them for dangerous capabilities and enact safeguards to mitigate reasonable risks.
As a native Michigander, Kroth said he’s proud to see Michigan engaging with AI, both in using it to improve residents’ lives and for the legislature’s interest in creating legislation to regulate it.
“Getting this right for our state will require an understanding of the unique nature of the risks posed by AI,” Kroth said. “AI isn’t just ChaGPT. It’s a family of technologies designed to perform tasks that normally require human thinking, like understanding speech, recognizing images, making decisions or solving problems. It’s this problem solving and autonomy that make AI incredibly promising, and like many powerful tools, potentially dangerous as well.”
One scenario Kroth presented is an AI system charged with increasing the efficiency of a factory that reasons to save on waste management, it should discharge toxic waste into a nearby river, without human direction to make that decision.
ChatGPT just a few years ago couldn’t perform simple math equations with precision, but now AI is winning math competitions, outpacing human capability, Andrew Doris, a senior policy analyst at the Secure AI Project, told members of the committee Wednesday.
AI can help humans solve complex problems, Doris said, it can also be used to perpetuate major cyber attacks or give instructions on how to create a bio weapon and then how to cause the most harm to the public.
“By this time next year, a lot of experts worry that we’re going to be in a much scarier place, and that the window to get out ahead of that is closing pretty quickly,” Doris said. “We think that the way to get out ahead of that is to require the companies building these models to develop what’s called safety and security protocols describing how they will test their models for these dangerous capabilities and what safeguards that they will put in to mitigate those risks.”
The largest AI companies currently implement these protocols voluntarily already, Doris said, but as the field becomes more competitive, it’s important to mandate that companies don’t cut corners on safety.
Federal regulations on AI are slow moving and time is of the essence, Doris added, so Michigan ought not to wait for federal action or a domestic tragedy to occur before it takes preventative action.
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), who is the sponsor for House Bill 4668, briefly outlined on Wednesday another bill being considered by the committee concerning AI.
House Bill 4667 would create specific criminal penalties for intentional development or usage of AI to commit a crime.
Lightner used the example of a grandmother getting a scam call using an AI-generated audio recording of her granddaughter in order to scam the grandmother out of thousands of dollars. If the scammer is caught, they can be charged with fraud, but there isn’t an area of state criminal law that fully encapsulates the weaponization of AI, Lightner said.
Under the bill, it would be a mandatory 8-year felony for a person who develops, possesses, or uses an AI system with the intent to use the system to commit a crime. This is similar to Michigan’s felony firearm law, which adds an additional criminal penalty to a felony if the perpetrator had a firearm while committing the felony.
Creating or distributing an AI system with the intent that another person uses the system to commit a crime would be a felony under the bill, carrying a mandatory 4-year prison sentence.
“This bill gives prosecutors a new way to capture the full story of what happened and to hold the perpetrator fully accountable, because if we don’t name this kind of exploitation in our law, we leave our most vulnerable residents, like a grandma, in legal limbo,” Lightner said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1477933017-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 16:08:49.101877

The City Council had axed tax funding for health care services because clinic’s website had once contained abortion-related links.
The post Gillette Reproductive Health funding restored with restrictions appeared first on WyoFile .","GILLETTE—After a tense Gillette City Council meeting, $30,000 in funding for Gillette Reproductive Health was returned to the city’s 2025-2026 budget during a third and final reading with a 5-2 vote.
Gillette Mayor Shay Lundvall, Ward One Representative Jim West, Ward Two’s Tim Carsrud and Ward Three’s Heidi Gross and Nathan McLeland voted last week to reintroduce the funding.
Voting against the measure was Ward One’s Chris Smith and Ward Two’s Jack Clary, the latter having proposed the initial removal of the funding during the first reading earlier this month, which had passed with a 4-3 vote.
Ahead of the proposed amendment, the council heard dozens of pleas from citizens of the city and wider Campbell County area during the budget’s public forum, with the majority asking them to restore the funding.
“It is easy to stand at a podium or pulpit and oppose access to Plan B, birth control, and essential women’s healthcare,” said Laurin Jensen, reading a statement on behalf of her friend Savannah Maddocks. “It is far more difficult — and far less visible — to walk alongside a woman who is trying to raise a child alone, underpaid, under-resourced, and overwhelmed.”
According to the amendment, proposed by Carsrud, the $30,000 in 1% sales tax funding for Gillette Reproductive Health would be restored with certain restrictions.
“Your decision reflects not only the facts but the voices of more than 1,200 community members who have signed a petition and many others making their voice heard online. “Julie Price Carroll, Gillette Reproductive Health 
In addition to not being able to use the funds for the promotion of abortion, directly or indirectly, the amendment required the monies to be kept separate from GRH’s general fund, provide an itemized account of the funds used and keep any links to websites or materials promoting abortion off its own website. 
Finally, the clinic would be unable to make medical referrals for abortion services.
“If we’re able to come to a reasonable compromise, we can at least have the assurance that steps are being taken to prevent abortion referrals,” Lundvall said. “If we walk away from this opportunity, the city forfeits its seat at the table, and with it, our ability to influence this matter in a meaningful, values driven way, and I’ll leave you with this, if, through all this effort, we can come together as a city and save even just one life, then every bit of work, debate and compromise will have been worth it.”
Following the reintroduction of the funding, the council quickly voted 6-1 to approve the third and final reading of the budget, with Clary casting the only vote against.
Following the vote, Gillette Reproductive Health Executive Director Julie Price Carroll returned to the podium during the meeting’s general public comment, expressing her thanks for the change in course by the council.
“On behalf of the board, the staff, the community and our patients, I want to thank you and the council for voting to continue funding for GRH,” she said. “Your decision reflects not only the facts but the voices of more than 1,200 community members who have signed a petition and many others making their voice heard online. We are grateful for your support and remain committed to providing compassionate compliance and essential health care to people in this community.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday that the temporary detention center being constructed at an isolated Everglades airfield will have “zero impact” on Everglades restoration, rebuking concerns by environmental advocates and local officials who say the project threatens drinking water and protected land.
Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said this week in a written statement that her office has “significant concerns about the scope and scale of the state’s efforts, particularly regarding the environmental safeguards in place given the potentially devastating impact to the Everglades.”
DeSantis scoffed at those remarks while appearing at a bill-signing event in Tampa on Wednesday, contending the opposition from critics stems from their antipathy to the crackdown on undocumented immigrants by the Trump administration.
“I think people are just — they’re trying to use the Everglades as a pretext, just for the fact that they oppose immigration enforcement,” he said.
“I mean, let’s be clear. That’s where you are from the far left now. They don’t want the laws enforced at all, and you’re seeing that with some of the demonstrations and some of the other things. You have a right to have that view, but that is not the policy of the United States of America. That is not the policy of the state of Florida.”
The Sierra Club and Friends of the Everglades are among the organizations that have come out in opposition to the project.
“This proposal is not only deeply inhumane, it is profoundly irresponsible from an environmental, ethical, and fiscal standpoint,” said Javier Estevez, political and legislative director with Sierra Club Florida.
”The Everglades is a unique and fragile ecosystem — a UNESCO World Heritage Site, home to countless endangered species, and a vital source of drinking water for more than nine million Floridians. To pave over a portion of this irreplaceable landscape for a high‑security prison is nothing short of ecological vandalism.”
On Sunday, Friends of the Everglades held a protest against the plan at the abandoned Everglades Jetport in the Big Cypress National Preserve. They are directing their members to urge the governor and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to back off the plan.
DeSantis confirmed on Wednesday that the federal government will pay all of the costs of constructing and maintaining the facility, which is expected to provide as many as 1,000 beds to hold undocumented migrants once it is completed, according to a video posted last week on social media by Uthmeier.
DeSantis added that the state will soon begin work on “something similar” at Camp Blanding Joint Training Center near Starke, which serves as the primary military reservation and training base for the Florida National Guard.
Everglades money
The governor expressed incredulity that anyone could claim that in backing this plan he was somehow working to set back Everglades restoration.
“You’re talking about the guy who’s plowed how much money into Everglades restoration?” DeSantis said rhetorically when asked about concerns that the detention facility could harm Everglades restoration.
“In fact, [Senate President] Ben Albritton and I had to fight to get Everglades fully funded [this year]. The original House budget print in the Florida House cut half a billion dollars out of Everglades restoration.”
The budget passed by the Legislature last week includes $810 million for Everglades restoration, the largest single-year commitment in the state’s history. DeSantis had offered $805 million in his original proposed budget, but the House proposed allocating just $357 million. Going into this year, the DeSantis administration announced that it had devoted $6.5 billion for Everglades restoration since he entered office in January 2019.
DeSantis is using emergency powers to gain control of the land, after his administration offered to buy it from the county. The Florida Department of Emergency Management offered to purchase the land for $20 million, but Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava gave a counteroffer of $190 million, leading DeSantis’ office to describe the request as “unreasonable.”
The Phoenix asked DeSantis whether it is possible for the two parties to negotiate an agreed upon price.
“They’ve been working on it,” he said. “I think that response is more posturing for the stuff, but this is actually a Collier-Dade Airport that’s there. We use it for emergencies. It ain’t like we’re creating something new. It’s a way to do this in conjunction with the federal government, who’s funding it in a way that’s not going to have impacts on our broader community.”

Martin Heinrich (center) hosted a roundtable discussion with other western Democratic senators and advocates in wildlife, hunting and fishing and lands rallying against proposed sales of public lands. (Screenshot by Danielle Prokop) Republican-backed proposals to sell swaths of public lands represent an assault to tribal sovereignty, outdoor recreation, critical wildlife habitat and “our children’s birthrights,” U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) said Wednesday.
“In one fell swoop, these proposals threaten every form of outdoor recreation, every form of natural and cultural heritage and habitat for wildlife — all to pay for a tax handout,” Heinrich said during a discussion he hosted in Washington, D.C. that included other Democratic US senators, alongside hunters, wildlife advocates and legal experts. “That doesn’t sound very American to me, and it clearly doesn’t sound very American to the hundreds of thousands of people across the political spectrum in the West raising their voices right now.”
Public lands protesters picket Western governors’ conference

Heinrich’s event comes as uncertainty prevails regarding a controversial proposal to sell off public lands to build housing spearheaded by Republican Sen. Mike Lee from Utah.
After the U.S. Senate Parliamentarian determined earlier this week that the language in Lee’s proposal did not comply with the Senate’s rules for budget reconciliation, Lee said he would revise the proposal and that he would exclude U.S. Forest Service land and limit the Bureau of Land Management land to areas near “population centers.”
Heinrich, the ranking member of the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee, applauded the parliamentarian’s decision, but warned “the fight is not over.”
He pointed out the finality of selling off public lands, saying: “Once these lands go into private hands, we will not get them back. From the date of sale, the land must be used for what it is sold for: development. It can never be used for conservation, recreation, hunting, fishing — all the things that these lands provide today.”
  Hilary Tompkins, a former solicitor in the U.S. Department of the Interior in the Obama administration, said Wednesday that Lee’s proposed sales of public lands are overlooking local or tribal input. (Screenshot by Danielle Prokop)
Hilary Tompkins, a former solicitor in the U.S. Department of the Interior in the Obama administration, said Lee’s proposal bypassed tribal consultation, even though much of the land in question lies in Indian Country.
“There’s also no clear protection for sacred sites and cultural resources of tribes and the public lands that would be sold to the highest bidder,” Tompkins said.
GOP bill makes 14 million acres of public land in NM ‘eligible’ for sale, according to new analysis

She noted the original proposal identified U.S. Forest Service lands on Mount Taylor in Grants, New Mexico, one of four mountains sacred to the Navajo nation.
“This is a very precious place for me and my family, and we have conducted important ceremonial life journey milestones involving that mountain. We cannot put these precious places on the auction block,” said Tompkins, who is originally from Ramah, New Mexico.
Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada) urged Lee to listen to people with concerns about sales of public lands.
“If he wants to do something in his own state of Utah, more power to you, go do it, work with all the stakeholders, let’s do it,” she said. “But don’t come into our states and dictate what should be done.”
Heinrich pointed to his recent experiences fishing on Pecos River, and said while the lands are some of his favorite places in New Mexico, it’s crucial that they remain open for future generations.
“Public lands are an essential democratic part of American culture and identity, and they belong to us,” he said. “They define us.”

Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) asks to read her unrecorded votes into the record.On the final day of the Maine Legislature, Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives held one final argument over the rights of censured lawmaker Rep. Laurel Libby, debating over her request to read unrecorded votes into the record.
The Auburn Republican had been barred from voting or speaking on the chamber floor in late February for posting a transgender student’s personal information on her legislative Facebook page. She petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for relief after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied her motion for an expedited appeal to end the censure, which she argued disenfranchised her constituents. In May, the court granted an injunction restoring her right to vote and speak on the House floor.
Citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, Libby sought unanimous consent from her colleagues to read into the record those that she would have taken during the term of her censure. Some Democratic representatives objected, sparking a heated debate about civility, legislative process, and constitutional rights. Despite initial objections, she was ultimately allowed to speak after a 106-34 vote.
The debate over letting her speak highlighted some of the ongoing tensions within the chamber, with Republicans representatives blaming the Democratic majority for silencing Libby. 
“This is an example of raw political power, one party exerting control over another … and not letting one of one of the minority members speak,” said Rep. Joseph Underwood (R-Presque Isle).
Rep. Richard Campbell, a Republican from Orrington, said in his 32 years serving in and out of the state legislature, “what I’ve observed in this first regular session of 132nd is the worst I’ve ever seen.”
However, Rep. Christina Mitchell (D-Cumberland) pushed back, pointing out that Libby always had the opportunity to apologize for her action, which would have ended the censure.
“A precedent was set before in this house when a choice was made not to apologize,” she said.
Others questioned whether there was any difference in speaking votes out loud or more formally having them documented on the record. House Speaker Ryan Fecteau replied that there wasn’t, because everything that now happens in the chamber is documented via video and archived.
“The request is more so a formality than anything else at this point,” he said.
After the vote, Libby proceeded to read hundreds of votes on bills into the record, speaking for more than 20 minutes.
 When she started speaking, some Democrats left the chamber. Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) who co-chairs the Llabor Committee on which Libby serves, said the representative has had the ability to vote on bills in committee meetings while censured, but has rarely shown up, even in instances where her vote could have changed the outcome of bills. 
“She was too busy telling the media how she was being silenced to actually use her voice and her vote on the work her constituents elected her to do,” Roeder told Maine Morning Star.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)FRANKFORT — Celebrating the passage of a swath of GOP policies this year, Senate Republican leaders, joined by constitutional officers, on Wednesday highlighted laws that will go into effect Friday. 
The senators also unveiled the temporary quarters where lawmakers will convene while the Capitol undergoes renovations over the next few years. The new building stands next to the Capitol Annex in Frankfort. 
It is unclear at this point if the Republican-controlled General Assembly will need to reconvene before January for a special session to allocate more dollars toward Kentucky communities recovering from storm damage in recent months, the Republican senators said. In 2026, the General Assembly will deliberate the next two-year state budget. 
Most laws the General Assembly passed earlier this year are set to take effect Friday, as per the Kentucky Constitution. Bills that aren’t general appropriates or have emergency causes go into effect 90 days after the legislature adjourns.  
The new laws include:

Senate Bill 2, which ends hormone treatments for transgender inmates in Kentucky prisons. 
Senate Bill 19, which requires public schools to observe a daily moment of silence and permits off-campus “moral instruction.” 
Senate Bill 84 says that Kentucky courts should interpret laws without referring to a state agency’s interpretation of them, much like the U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down the precedent of the Chevron deference at the federal level. 
House Bill 45 aims to limit foreign influence in Kentucky elections for ballot measures, like a constitutional amendment. 
House Bill 342 requires high school students to take a financial literacy course before graduating. 

Senate Republican Floor Leader Max Wise, of Campbellsville, said that the more than 100 new laws are “each a product of thoughtful policy making” through the legislative process. 
“Together, they reflect the core concern priorities embraced by the Kentucky General Assembly, the supermajorities, and those priorities — lowering taxes, better schools, safer communities and a government that serves the people,” he said. 
Legislators are in the midst of the interim session, where committees with House and Senate members meet to discuss policies and review reports ahead of the next legislative session. Some of those groups also include special task forces, like the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Kentucky Task Force. Senate President Robert Stivers pointed to the group as a way to study how to make health care more accessible at a time when Medicaid funding is in the national spotlight. A U.S. House bill approved last month included a $793 billion cut to Medicaid funding over the next decade and is now in the U.S. Senate. 
Stivers said that focusing on supporting farm-to-table agriculture programs could be a way to promote “healthier lifestyles” naturally with fresh produce on Kentucky tables. 
“This will help with the A1C, the blood pressure, all the other health care indices that we have that are poor in this state,” Stivers said. 
Weeks ago, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said he would likely call a special session of the legislature to allocate more funding to communities affected by storms earlier this year, including tornadoes. However, the Senate leaders were not sure if a session would be needed at this point. 
“We’re waiting to see what the governor’s numbers are and the money that has been allocated for these specific events and see how the executive branch has been addressing them,” said Senate Republican Caucus Chair Robby Mills, of Henderson. “There was quite a substantial amount of storm damage. It does take time to recover. And we’ve got a few months until we’re back in session.” 
The General Assembly approved a bill to set up a state aid fund for response to floods before it adjourned this year. That included raising a cap the legislature had placed on emergency spending by the Beshear administration without lawmakers’ approval. 
Stivers said if Beshear needs more money, lawmakers can do a one-day session to approve funds. The Senate pPresident had previously vowed that lawmakers were ready to provide any necessary funding for recovery. 
After this year’s session adjourned, legislative furniture and items were moved into the temporary chamber, and Stivers added that the space would be functional if a special session is called before January. 
“It will be ready July 1, flip the switch and have anything necessary done in it that we need to do,” Stivers said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250625_KYSenateChambers_ds473-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 15:10:56.389388

As of Wednesday afternoon, Israel and Iran are engaged in a tenuous truce after U.S. forces bombed key Iranian nuclear facilities Saturday. War broke out between the long-time enemy nations earlier this month when Israel launched a surprise attack on nuclear and military sites in Iran, which retaliated with missile strikes against Israel.
As the sun set Tuesday, organizers handed out electric tea candles to members of the crowd. Activists at the rear of the group brought a large illuminated sign reading “Trump must go now,” shining a dim light on the proceedings.
Shabnam Bashiri, an Iranian-American and organizer with the American Friends Service Committee, dismissed arguments from supporters of the U.S. strikes that the attacks will spur Iranians to rise up against their government.
“At the end of the day, liberation never comes from the outside,” she said. “So it’s up to the Iranian people to determine that for themselves. I think the idea that folks would be greeted as liberators with bombs is just a ridiculous thing to think, and it has been proven over and over again that that’s not the case, and I hope that people’s memories aren’t so short-term.”
Many of those at the vigil said they are concerned about the U.S. being dragged into a broader war that could be costly in money and lives.

“This is the same pattern that we have seen used before, the same pattern of we have to stop them from getting this weapon that we do not have evidence that these strikes will stop, we have to act now” said Marisa Pyle, an organizer with Jewish Voice for Peace Atlanta. “This is what we’re told time and time again, without evidence, from people who want to escalate aggression for their own goals and to consolidate their own power.”
President Donald Trump and allies have said the strikes were intended to thwart Iran’s ambitions to obtain a nuclear weapon. The U.S. intelligence community as recently as March reported that Iran was not seeking to create such a weapon.
“Our president is ignoring our intelligence agencies, ignoring the entire world’s intelligence, saying that Iran does not have nuclear bombs, and we are going purely off of what Israel is asking us to do, and that is not OK,” said attendee Shanda Williams.
Among Georgia leaders, reaction to the strikes fell mostly along party lines, with Republicans generally but not universally backing them and Democrats mostly in opposition, arguing that they were not necessary and that Trump should have sought approval from Congress.

As the vigil went on, attendees waved signs to passing traffic, eliciting honks and cheers as well as some less supportive noises from motorists, including cries of “Trump!”
Atlanta Civil rights attorney Mawuli Davis compared the protests with those organized by Georgia civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., who spoke out against the Vietnam War – a stance that earned him criticism at the time.
“There are going to be people who will point at us and criticize us and use all kinds of scapegoating and all kinds of tactics to try to diminish our voice, but we can’t allow that to dissuade us from knowing that we’re standing on the right side of this,” he said. “You can’t say you love Dr. King if you don’t love non-violence and you don’t love the call to stop the war, no wars. The connection is clear, it’s not about being popular, it’s about justice and being on the right side of history.”

Free.,US Senate panel grills Trump CDC nominee on vaccines,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-panel-grills-trump-cdc-nominee-vaccines,,"WASHINGTON — Members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions pressed President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccine recommendations Wednesday after the Health and Human Services secretary fired members of a critical vaccine panel this month.Trump’s pick, former acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, said that she trusted vaccines while defending HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision this month — widely seen as part of a vaccine-skeptical agenda — to fire all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, and recommend eight new members.“Part of the secretary's vision in restoring public trust is making sure that the American people can be confident in the way the evidence and science is driving decision-making,” she told senators.The panel’s seven members — one dropped out this week — will meet Wednesday and Thursday to review data and vote on new vaccine recommendations. The recommendations carry significant weight as insurance providers and federal health programs like Medicaid use them to determine if shots are covered and schools rely on them for immunization mandates.Cassidy questionsLouisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who chairs the committee, said he was concerned about ACIP, especially as a non-CDC staff member is scheduled to give a presentation to the committee about thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative. The panel is expected to vote on approving flu shots that contain the compound.Lyn Redwood, the former head of Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group that Kennedy founded, is giving the presentation arguing that thimerosal causes autism.Cassidy said that while Monarez had no part in this week's ACIP meeting, or the agenda, he said that “if the ACIP hearing today is being used to sow distrust, I would ask that going forward, that you would make sure that there really was a balanced perspective.”“Yes, someone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who is reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,” Cassidy, who is a physician, said.Monarez, who was the agency’s acting director from January to March, said that she trusted vaccines and that immunization was important to save lives.If Monarez is confirmed by the Senate, she would be the first director of the CDC without a medical degree in nearly 70 years.

Lisa Murkowski said she was concerned about the backgrounds of the seven new panelists.“I would hope that one of the things that you would all be looking into is to make sure that these individuals are going to be looking at the science in front of them, (and) leave their political bias at home,” Murkowski said.Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland also pressed Monarez about Kennedy’s actions to fire everyone on the panel.Murray asked Monarez if the new members of the panel voted to not recommend vaccines, if she would listen to that recommendation.Monarez sidestepped the question and said the roles at ACIP were difficult to fill and that members needed to pass an ethics process.“If they have not gone through an ethics approval process they shouldn’t be participating in the meetings,” she said.Alsobrooks asked Monarez if she believed the 17 members fired from ACIP lacked qualifications.Monarez did not answer the question, but said Kennedy’s reasoning for “resetting the ACIP to a new cohort was going to be on the path of restoring public trust.”Grant funding and layoffsSenators also raised concerns about grants that had been canceled, even though Congress already approved the funds.Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins, who is the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, said that her state is suffering from a high level of Lyme disease and as a result a vaccine was in the works at a research institute in Maine.“This vaccine is very promising and I want to make sure that it is allowed to continue to its conclusion,” Collins said.Monarez agreed and said if she is confirmed, she will specifically work to make sure funding for that vaccine continues.“It's ironic that our dogs can get a vaccine to protect them against tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease but we humans can’t and I hope we can remedy that,” Collins said.Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, pressed Monarez about the elimination of the Office on Smoking and Health at the CDC. He asked if she was involved in laying off all the staff in April, the month after her brief stint as acting director ended.“I had no participation in (the layoffs) after I left,” she said.Fluoride in waterAlsobrooks pressed Monarez about Kennedy’s push to have the CDC stop recommending that low levels of fluoride be placed in public drinking water.Fluoride is added in drinking water to help prevent cavities, tooth decay and other dental health issues.Alsobrooks asked Monarez, who is her constituent, if the public water supply that contains fluoride in Potomac, Maryland, where Monarez lives, was safe to drink.“I believe the water in Potomac, Maryland, is safe,” Monarez said.",,,,2025-06-25 15:10:56.389388

Dan McKee announced Wednesday he will forgo signing the fiscal 2026 budget, citing concern with tax and fee increases. (Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Criticizing the “unnecessary” taxes and fees in lawmakers’ approved fiscal 2026 budget, Gov. Dan McKee announced Wednesday that he will not sign the $14.3 billion tax-and-spend plan.
Instead, the budget will take effect without McKee’s signature — the first time a state budget has passed sans the gubernatorial stamp of approval since 2010 under then-Gov. Don Carcieri.
McKee blasted the Rhode Island General Assembly for the changes made to his original, proposed fiscal 2026 budget — revisions that, as McKee tells it, he was unaware of until after the House Committee on Finance unveiled the amended spending plan on June 10.
“The issues I am talking about today were not privy to me until it was privy to you,” McKee told reporters at a press conference at the William E. Powers Department of Administration building Wednesday morning.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson were equally in the dark on McKee’s intent not to sign the budget until Wednesday. They received a two-page letter from McKee at the same time it was distributed to reporters, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi, said in an email. 
Shekarchi and Lawson stood by their approved spending plan despite McKee’s critique.
“We were proud to again pass a balanced and responsible budget with bipartisan support that was delivered for Rhode Islanders by addressing our state’s health care crisis and continuing to improve access to housing that families can afford,” they said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.
McKees’s biggest sources of concern are a 2-cent-per-gallon increase in the state gas tax, meant to help plug the deficit facing the Rhode Island Public Transit Agency, an increase in real estate conveyance taxes and a new, $4 per-person monthly health insurance fee to pay for a state assessment on health care needs.
“This is not a time to be putting fees and additional taxes on the working families in the state of Rhode Island,” McKee said. “I am drawing a line in the sand. We need to have a great deal more fiscal responsibility.”
Yet, McKee stopped short of vetoing the budget, noting that because the state’s executive does not have line-item veto power, the “best message” was to omit his signature.
“I deal in the world that is reality,” McKee said. “The best message I can send is what I am doing now, which is letting people know they are being taxed unnecessarily.”










This is not a time to be putting fees and additional taxes on the working families in the state of Rhode Island. I am drawing a line in the sand. 


– Gov. Dan McKee on why he won't sign the state's fiscal 2026 budget


McKee made clear he wants the move to put pressure on lawmakers by raising public attention to the slew of tax and fee raises that, in his mind, have slipped under the radar till now.
He urged residents to call their state senators and representatives, noting that public pressure could, hypothetically, force the Rhode Island General Assembly to reconvene and change its spending plan.
Had McKee vetoed the budget, lawmakers would have been forced to return to the State House to make adjustments, or override his veto by a three-fifths majority of both chambers. McKee acknowledged the overwhelming support for the fiscal 2026 budget in both chambers meant a legislative override would be likely.

A State House divided 
McKee’s thinly veiled attack on lawmakers comes as he prepares for a 2026 reelection campaign which could include a primary challenge from Shekarchi. Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, has repeatedly denied any interest in running for governor next year. But the two state leaders no longer appear in lock step, evidenced by a series of cracks in their previously united front.
In May, Shekarchi attempted to block McKee’s proposed raises for a dozen of his cabinet members. The pay bumps ultimately went through, after Senate President Valarie Lawson declined to give the necessary sign-on from her chamber to stop the raises.
In unveiling the lawmakers’ revised fiscal 2026 spending plan earlier this month, Shekarchi also expressed frustration with the many miscalculations and unexpected holes McKee left for the Rhode Island General Assembly to clean up. 
McKee insisted Wednesday that his initial fiscal 2026 spending plan was a “good solid budget,” while the version approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly as a “bad budget.”
Shekarchi and Lawson refuted McKee’s framing.
“Months of public testimony highlighted the ways in which the budget submitted in January did not address these priorities and included items that were simply unworkable or broke promises we made to retirees,” they said. 
Lawmakers restored a required $21.6 million allocation to the state pension fund in the final fiscal 2026 budget. McKee had proposed to skip the mandatory return of half of the state’s unspent surplus to its pension system.
House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, a Foster Republican, voted against the state’s fiscal 2026 budget. Yet Chippendale also criticized McKee for what he said was a “transparently political” decision to let the spending plan go into effect without his signature.
“If he truly felt this budget was unacceptable and was acting on principle, he would have vetoed it, not staged a PR move,” Chippendale said in a statement Wednesday.  “It takes genuine leadership to make the hard decisions to right-size our budget.”
It’s not unusual for lawmakers to take red ink to the executive’s spending plan based on their own policy priorities as well as updated state revenue numbers, which are not available until May of each year. Executive and legislative leaders hammer out their differences in closed-door negotiations, a practice which McKee confirmed also took place this year.
Yet, McKee also said he was completely unaware that the revised budget would raise the state gas tax — set to hit 41 cents per gallon starting July 1 — despite having “open and frank” conversations with lawmakers about RIPTA throughout the session. 
“Rhode Islanders already pay more at the pump than drivers in Massachusetts (27 cents) and Connecticut (25 cents) and this change would further worsen our regional competitive disadvantage,” McKee wrote in his letter to Shekarchi. 
Massachusetts and Connecticut residents also pay state or local car taxes, while Rhode Island phased out its motor vehicle excise tax completely in 2023.
The state’s gas tax increase, along with a larger share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account, provides nearly half of the money needed to close RIPTA’s estimated $32.6 million deficit. But McKee’s administration presented an alternative plan to legislative leaders that could have given the same amount of money to RIPTA without raising taxes — instead redirecting 2 cents from the existing gas tax along with carryforward revenue from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and state bonds money.
McKee’s proposed fiscal 2026 spending plan did not offer any extra money for RIPTA, despite its well-documented cash woes. McKee said he was waiting for results of an agency efficiency study, which was supposed to be completed this spring but remains unfinished.

Powers Department of Administration building on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)
State surplus ‘more than enough’
McKee also dismissed questions about why he opted not to present his own, revised fiscal 2026 spending plan after the updated state revenue estimates came out in May. The biannual Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference revealed an extra $67 million in state revenue for the current fiscal year, which McKee said was sufficient to cover expenses without raising taxes and fees.
Even after backfilling the funds to cover an undercount of students in poverty and new contracts with state troopers and corrections officers, the fiscal 2025 surplus still left $23 million to share across priority measures like increasing primary care reimbursement rates, according to napkin math presented by Brian Daniels, director of Rhode Island’s Office of Management and Budget.
Still, that balance would not cover everything lawmakers included in their spending plan: aid to hospitals, nursing homes, cities and towns, and college graduates who stay and work in in-demand fields in the state.
“These are all things we generally support but we did not include them because we had to make difficult choices,” Daniels said.
McKee’s tirade against higher taxes was coupled with many mentions of uncertainty over federal funding, which, if cut, could upend critical state Medicaid and food assistance programs. He acknowledged that what comes out of Washington may merit future tax hikes or other new revenue sources — but until Congress finalizes its own spending plan, any state tax and fee increases are unnecessary.
The fiscal 2026 budget also applies the state’s 7% sales tax to short-term public parking, while raising fees on traffic violations and vehicle registrations. And, it sets the stage for a new tax on second homes worth over $1 million starting July 1, 2026. McKee did not directly answer multiple questions regarding his stance on the “Taylor Swift tax,” a reference to the pop star’s $28.3 million vacation home in Westerly.  
“We didn’t have to raise taxes on anyone in this budget,” he said. “We could have balanced the budget and met the most important issues still on the table.”
The fiscal 2026 budget approved by lawmakers is set to take effect Friday.

Spencer Cox has a new leadership position among his Western counterparts, and also, a new platform to advance an item sitting on top of his priorities agenda — energy abundance.
On Tuesday, during the annual meeting of the Western Governors’ Association, an organization that aims to join bipartisan policy among governors of 22 Western states and territories, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham passed the gavel to Cox as the association’s new chair.
Along with Hawaii Gov. Josh Green as vice chair, Cox is set to serve in this role for the next year. Cox is planning to use his tenure to implement a year-long initiative focusing on tools to meet the West’s growing energy demand, according to a news release.

“Governor Lujan Grisham has been a tremendous Chair, showing real leadership in uniting us around addressing the housing crisis,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “Our new focus on energy is bold — and urgently needed. It’s been nearly 50 years since we’ve had this kind of moment: rising demand, available capital, and the political will to build. And that’s exactly what we intend to do.”
With his “Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West,” Cox is hoping to examine challenges and opportunities to expand energy production, modernize transmission and storage options.
“The West is rich in energy — but outdated infrastructure, permitting delays, and rising demand threaten America’s energy edge,” a website for Cox’s initiative says. With this year-long platform, it states, “the West is building the backbone of a more reliable, affordable, and secure grid.”
Cox’s plans for the Western Governors’ Association is in line with what he has in mind for Utah. Last year, Cox unveiled “Operation Gigawatt,” a strategy to double the state’s energy production over the next 10 years, boosting new resources like geothermal and nuclear. This year already Cox has been busy signing agreements with nuclear technology companies and other states, as well as heavily advocating to ease federal nuclear regulations.
Currently, Cox is working on gathering data through a survey aimed toward interested individuals or organizations to manage the scope of the initiative, identifying priority issues for governors, best practices for developing resources and infrastructure, and federal policy issues.

Utilizing $500 antenna kits designed by U of M, students at 18 schools across eight states and Puerto Rico have been working to monitor solar radio bursts, an earlier indicator of geomagnetic storms, as part of the SunRISE Ground Radio Lab.
Launched in August 2023, the collaboration has already yielded results, with a study published in Earth and Space Science Wednesday analyzing the project’s early findings. 
Mojtaba Akhavan-Tafti, an associate research scientist at U of M who leads the lab, told Michigan Advance that the project began as a program for both undergraduate and graduate students who were tasked with designing and building their own antenna and taking measurements, which they used for scientific analysis. 
Since the class started in 2021, it’s seen a strong turnout of students, Akhavan-Tafti said, starting with five or six students and growing to 21 to 22 students a semester. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Later on, NASA came back to us and said, ‘Hey, we know that this program has been very productive. A lot of students speak very highly of it. Is there any chance that you could involve high school students in your project, because, you know, they’re at the start of their careers, they’re trying to figure out what to do with their lives, and maybe they would be very interested in getting involved?’” Akhavan-Tafti said. 
However, the antennas students were building cost around $25,000 a unit, with shipping and assembly also presenting concerns. So they put the challenge to the college students, who developed an antenna that is simpler to install with a much smaller $500 price tag. 
With NASA covering the cost of the antenna kits, and another one of its programs, Radio JOVE, supplying them, the university began reaching out to high schools to see if they would be interested in participating in the lab program, later working with NASA’s educational programs to partner with schools across the country. 
“When we reached out to high schools originally to start the program, we had two requirements: One is that the school needs to be okay with installing the antenna on campus, and two that they need to be…collecting and uploading data on a regular basis, on a weekly basis, to our data repository,” Akhavan-Tafti said. 
After receiving the antenna, students work through an online training module introducing students to the field of radio astronomy, explaining what the antennas do and how to assemble them and breaking down what the data collected looks like and how it can be used scientifically.

Afterwards, an entire class would often work to install the antenna on campus, with the university offering guidance on how to collect and upload data, Akhavan-Tafti said.
The goal of the program is to engage students in science, technology, engineering, arts and math, or STEAM activities, with hopes of helping students realize that it’s not rocket science to get involved in the space industry, Akhavan-Tafti explained.
 “It’s a rapidly growing industry that needs people who are inspired and are ready for the challenge. And why not the next generation?” he said. 
Alongside tracking low-frequency radio bursts from the sun, the program also held two observation campaigns, capturing data during the previous October 2023 annular solar eclipse and the total solar eclipse in April 2024. 
While many of the high schools have completely automated their data collection process, the students have also been very helpful in characterizing the data, Akhavan-Tafti said. In addition to sifting through data to separate radio signals from other noise, the students have also been slowly working towards automating the categorization of different types of signals, he said.

As students monitor these signals from the ground, NASA has also been working to launch a set of six toaster-sized satellites to observe solar radio emissions from orbit. 
Akhavan-Tafti explained that these bursts of radio signals are tied to phenomena like solar flares and coronal mass ejections, large bubbles of plasma which carry a magnetic field. When these ejections occur, they often take eight days to reach the earth where they can create geomagnetic storms. 
However, the radio signals associated with these events travel at the speed of light and arrive at the earth much earlier, Akhavan-Tafti explained, acting as a warning system for geomagnetic storms. 
While these storms are responsible for auroras, they can also disrupt signals, Akhavan-Tafti noted, pointing to $500 million in lost agricultural harvests in the U.S. last year due to automated tractors that rely on GPS going off track.
Additionally, geomagnetic storms can accelerate charged particles to very high speeds, potentially harming satellites and creating health and safety concerns for astronauts, Akahavan-Tafti said. 
Geomagnetic storms can also create radio blackouts and power outages, according to NASA. 
For students participating at the college level, they gain experience listening to a customer, designing a system to meet their needs, testing it in multiple environments to ensure it is functional and shipping out their prototype, Akhavan-Tafti explained. 
For high school students, the online training introduces them to radio astronomy, and exposes them to a number of concepts, including the various types of engineering and resources for getting involved in other science, technology, engineering and math based fields, he said. 
Students also learn how to work together to assemble their antenna and after completing the project, they receive a certificate from NASA which they can show while applying for university, Akhavan-Tafti said. 
“Beyond all of that, the data collection and analysis enables them to apply some of the science and math and engineering that they’ve learned in the classroom to real world problems to contribute to furthering our understanding of our universe,” Akhavan-Tafti said. 
Additionally as the space industry grows, this field will be where many students find themselves working, Akhavan-Tafti said, noting his focus is to teach students early on in their careers about the opportunities that are out there. 
“They could be the next scientists, they could be the next engineers, they could be the next policy makers, or even entrepreneurs who start their own businesses doing space-related activities. … we want the hardest working and smartest kids to start thinking about space and this space needs them,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SunRISE-GRL_Ann-Arbor-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 15:10:56.389388

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Photo: U.S. Department of Education)Nevada could see up to 12 new charter schools open in Fall 2026, including a Hebrew-language school in Henderson and a sports-focused school in North Las Vegas with plans to partner with the Vegas Golden Knights and Las Vegas Raiders.
This year’s application cycle is the first in which the cities of Henderson and North Las Vegas are considering approving and overseeing charter schools. Previously, cities and counties were not permitted to be charter school authorizers. That changed in 2023 through legislation sponsored by Gov. Joe Lombardo.
North Las Vegas City Council last week denied two charter school applications. Purpose Leadership Academy and Nevada Early College and Career Academy (NECCA) failed to meet multiple standards set in the city’s application rubric, according to city staff, giving the council little choice but to reject.
Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown and Councilman Isaac Barron, both career educators, emphasized before the unanimous votes to deny the applications that they are supportive of authorizing charter schools and providing more schooling options for residents.
Barron added that Clark County School District, where he worked for decades before retiring last year and whose board of trustees he serves on, has a track record of leaving North Las Vegas behind.
“Right now we have a decision in front of us,” he said. “If it’s just with our hearts, our hearts reach out to NECCA, they reach out to PLA, because we most definitely can identify with that. But we are also charged with being good financial stewards of our cities.”
Representatives for both proposed charter schools indicated they plan to work with city staff to address concerns. The schools have the option to resubmit their applications in the next few weeks for reconsideration in late August.
Both NECCA and Purpose Leadership last year applied to open charter schools under the Nevada State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) but were denied. This year, Purpose Leadership submitted its application to both North Las Vegas and the SPCSA.
 City of Henderson

The City of Henderson received four applications for the 2026-27 school year. The applications are currently under review by city staff and expected to be approved or denied in early August.
Kesher Academy is a proposed Hebrew-language charter school that uses the Hebrew language as “a means of fostering cultural connection, academic engagement, and global citizenship.” It is asking to open with 125 students in kindergarten through second grade, then scale up to 375 students, in kindergarten through seventh grade, over a six-year period.
According to its application, Kesher will be located at Congregation Ner Tamid, a Jewish synagogue in Henderson. The campus currently houses a private school and a preschool, both religiously affiliated. The campus is also listed as the physical location of a “full-time enrichment program for homeschool families,” which is not affiliated with any religious organization.
It is not uncommon for charter schools to operate out of churches, which often have space available and offer cheaper leases than commercial spaces.
Numerous Hebrew-language charter schools exist across the United States. While they have received some pushback because of Hebrew’s close ties to Jewish identity and tradition, they are not considered religious charter schools. Religious charter schools are considered unconstitutional, though there has been a push to change that.
Two of the applications are essentially for new campuses of existing charter schools authorized by the SPCSA. Founders Classical Academy currently operates a campus in Las Vegas and wants to open a campus in Henderson. Signature Preparatory currently operates a K-8 charter school in Henderson near Boulder Highway and Lake Mead Boulevard, and wants to open a K-12 campus in West Henderson.
The third applicant, Pioneer Technology & Arts Academy (PTAA) has twice applied with the SPCSA and been denied. The proposed school then sued the state. That case was dismissed. Last year, PTAA was approved by the SPCSA for a charter school license. That school, located in North Las Vegas, is expected to open in August for the upcoming academic year.
 SPCSA

The Nevada State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) is by far the largest authorizer of charter schools in the state. As of this year, the quasi-district enrolls more students than Washoe County School District.
SPCSA received seven applications from schools hoping to open for the 2026-27 academic year, according to materials posted to its website. Those applications are under review by staff and will ultimately be recommended for approval or denial by the state Charter School Board in late August.
Among the SPCSA applications is a proposal for Game Changer Sports Academy, to be located at Hylo Park, a mixed-used “sports and entertainment” district in North Las Vegas on the former site of the Fiesta Rancho and Texas Station casinos. According to its application, the charter school plans to integrate “academic excellence with athletic development” and will involve a partnership with the Vegas Golden Knights, who already operate an ice rink on the property, and the Al Davis-Eddie Robinson Leadership Academy, a partnership between the Las Vegas Raiders and UNLV designed to develop minority coaches and general managers.
While not a fully virtual or remote school, the proposed charter school plans on using an online curriculum complemented by in-person instruction and oversight. It will also operate an “athletic development program” involving strength and agility training 4 to 5 days a week. It hopes to open with 230 middle school students and expand over six years to grades 6-12 and 560 students.
Game Changer Sports Academy currently has a partnership with Delta Academy, an existing charter school authorized by the SPCSA.
The SPCSA is also considering an application for what would be the first charter school in Nye County.
Pahrump Valley Academy previously applied with the SPCSA but was denied. One representative for the proposed school told a town hall in April that the prior denial was “political”in nature and blamed then-Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia judge assigned to hear a mother’s vaccination lawsuit against the state school board has recused himself from the case, saying he wanted to avoid any conflict or impropriety.
Raleigh County Circuit Court Judge Todd Kirby previously served in the House of Delegates as a Republican, where he co-sponsored a bill loosening of the state’s strict school vaccination rules and another measure known as the “Equal Protection for Religion Act.”
The religious freedom bill, passed in 2023, is the basis for Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order mandating that the state permit families to use religious exemptions to school immunization rules. Morrisey announced on Tuesday his support for a Raleigh County mother who is suing the state school board for not accepting religious exemptions despite the governor’s executive order. The school board has said they won’t recognize religious exemptions to vaccine requirements this upcoming school year since West Virginia’s immunization law remains unchanged. 
On Wednesday, Kirby submitted a voluntary recall order, saying, “Avoiding even the appearance of a conflict or impropriety is essential to the maintenance of the independence, integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.”
He deemed himself disqualified to hear the case and directed the circuit clerk to randomly assign the case to a different judge within the circuit. 
The state Democratic Party had called on Kirby to recuse himself due to his support for the religious freedom bill and a piece of legislation in 2024 that would have eliminated childhood immunization requirements for private and parochial schools.
Kirby left the House of Delegates in 2024 to serve as a judge in the 10th Judicial Circuit. 
The vaccine issue has become a key political point for Morrisey so far in his first months as governor. He says the school board is stripping “religious liberty protections” from families. 
West Virginia had been one of only a handful of states that didn’t permit religious exemptions, and the governor issued his executive order permitting religious exemptions on his first full day in office.
In March, the GOP-led House of Delegates voted down a bill that would have codified executive order and changed state vaccine laws. In response, Morrisey said his executive order would stand and ordered the state health department to accept parent’s requests to bypass school immunization rules for religious reasons. More than 100 families have requested to use religious exemption for the upcoming school year, according to the state health department. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice have filed a writ of mandamus in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of two parents of immunocompromised students. That lawsuit seeks to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order.

Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, spoke about his potential gubernatorial run during a Westside Conservative Club meeting at the Machine Shed in Urbandale June 25, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)While Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, is still in the exploratory phase for his gubernatorial run, he spent much of his time at the Westside Conservative Club meeting Wednesday morning focused on a potential opponent in the race: Democrat Rob Sand.
Bousselot told the conservative group gathered at the Machine Shed in Urbandale that Sand, the state auditor and frontrunner to become the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial candidate was a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and “rich Des Moines liberal” who would hurt the state’s economy and pull back GOP policies passed by the Republican trifecta in recent years.
The Ankeny Republican pointed to Sand’s answer on a May interview on the WHO AM Simon Conway show, when he was asked if “biological boys or men should play women’s sports” answered simply, “no.” Bousselot said that when Republican state lawmakers had passed bills banning transgender girls from competing on women’s teams in Iowa schools and colleges and banning transgender students from using bathrooms and locker rooms conflicting with their assigned sex at birth, Sand said these measures were “hateful.”

Bousselot also said Sand has not served well as state auditor, saying that he “did nothing” in investigating and auditing the misallocation of $27.5 million in court debt funds caused by coding errors brought to the auditor’s office attention in 2022. He criticized Sand’s office for being late in delivering state audits in multiple years, as well as for his efforts to audit Iowa’s Education Savings Account (ESA) program providing taxpayer funds for private school tuition and associated costs while denying public school requests for auditing assistance.
“He has been running for governor since the day he was elected auditor, and not doing the job,” Bousselot said. “He just announced that he’s going to go on 100 town halls in the next four months — taxpayer-funded campaigning. Late on audits, refused to audit schools, ignored a whistleblower — if you don’t want to do the job, Rob, resign.”
Sand’s 100 town hall tour begins Wednesday with evening events in Waukee and Ankeny. Sand, the sole Democrat to currently hold statewide elected office in Iowa, has previously argued against criticisms of his office’s work by Republican lawmakers, including during a House Government Oversight Committee hearing when he said the court debt misallocation issue was a coding error, which is not a subject his office performs audits on.
He has also regularly pushed back against Bousselot and other GOP lawmakers for having passed legislation limiting the auditor’s office ability to access personal information in investigations and preventing the auditor from going to court for subpoena enforcement against state agencies, departments, boards, commissions and statewide elected officials.
Bousselot said Tuesday the focus on Sand is needed because Republicans need to be prepared for a tough gubernatorial race in 2026.
“It’s the first open seat for governor in a long, long time,” Bousselot said. “It’s going to be the toughest race for governor, arguably, in decades — maybe since Gov. Terry Branstad came back to take on an incumbent Chet Culver. We’ve got a opponent who’s a rich Des Moines liberal, $7 million already from his family … He wants to portray himself as one thing. But we know, who he really is, right. What he really stands for and the job he’s really done. (We) need to talk about it and not stop talking about it until Election Day.”
The race for Iowa governor next year has become a focus for many in the state following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she would not seek reelection after finishing her current term. As Sand and a handful of others are running for the Democratic nomination, the race to succeed Reynolds as the GOP gubernatorial candidate is also expected to draw many top candidates.
So far, former state Rep. Brad Sherman is the only Republican officially in the race, entering in February before Reynolds’ announcement. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and House Speaker Pat Grassley have expressed interest in running for the seat, though they have not made any official announcements, and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra launched what he called an exploratory committee for a gubernatorial campaign in May.
Bousselot also announced his “exploratory” committee in April, citing support from former Gov. Terry Branstad. Though he has not made an official campaign launch and has not made a filing committee for a gubernatorial run, Bousselot told Republicans at the WCC meeting he supports lowering property taxes, incentivizing Iowa’s manufacturing and agriculture sectors and continuing to advance conservative policies.
Many of these goals are being worked on by leadership at the Iowa Statehouse now, Bousselot said — but said that if Sand and Democrats gain power in the next election, these efforts will stall.
“Think about what we’ve accomplished with the trifecta right? Lower taxes, more freedom,” Bousselot said. “At the end of the day, that’s what we’ve done, lower taxes, more freedom. Our opponent has very different vision: higher taxes, bigger government, less safe, less free. So you want to see dysfunction, lose one set of the trifecta and it will be gridlocked. … That’s why I say it’s a generational election.”
Democrats have called for Iowans to reject Bousselot, saying he would continue policies advanced by Branstad and Reynolds that hurt the state’s economy.
“Iowans are expressing their unhappiness with Reynolds’ unpopular agenda, so they must reject Mike Bousselot — who has spent his life drafting legislation that has left our state 49th in the nation in economic growth and 48th in personal income growth,” Iowa Democratic Party spokesperson Paige Godden said in a statement following Bousselot’s exploratory committee launch. “Mike Bousselot is a career politician who has helped create some of Iowa’s most disastrous laws including Medicaid privatization that cost Iowans their healthcare plans and made life more difficult and more expensive.”
Bousselot says discussions on eminent domain, pipelines will continue
While Bousselot largely focused on issues uniting Republicans at the event, he also answered a question on an issue that has caused intra-party divides in the Iowa GOP — the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines. The Iowa Senate sent House File 639 to the governor this year, a bill dealing with multiple related issues that included a change to the the definition of a common carrier for hazardous liquid pipeline, new requirements for the Iowa Utilities Commission and increased insurance requirements.
Reynolds ultimately vetoed the legislation, saying it addressed real concerns but contained “vague legal standards and sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets.” Her decision came following the bill’s contentious path to the Senate floor, as many Senate GOP leaders also opposed the bill — including Bousselot.
Bousselot proposed an amendment to the legislation that was not approved during debate in the Senate which he said made improvements to the bill and provided more landowner protections against eminent domain in different projects, and that would have allowed companies to pursue voluntary easements outside of the approved project corridor to avoid using eminent domain.
He said his amendment, which was passed unanimously out of committee, was rejected in part because Democrats opposed the measure after he announced his exploratory committee for governor.
While he called the bill sent to Reynolds a “Trojan horse” that would allow environmental activists to interfere with building energy production infrastructure, Bousselot said he was committed to working on a solution to the issue.
“We have to solve this problem,” Bousselot said. “We have to put real protections in place for landowners that avoid eminent domain, that respect what we want to have eminent domain to be and not be used for, but also understand the importance of our agricultural economy and the importance of American infrastructure to the freedom and, frankly, the national security of our state and finding that balance. And I believe we can do that. I want to tackle hard problems in the legislature. I’ve never shied away from that. I didn’t shy away from this one, and I’m going to keep working.”

Butler, a Democrat, defeated Republican Ken Hilton by a vote of 964-774. Butler will now represent Strafford County District 12, which includes Somersworth and Rollinsford. Butler carried the vote in both communities. The district has reliably gone to Democrats in recent elections.
Prior to Tuesday’s election, Republicans had a 218-177 majority (there are two independents) in the 400-seat House, including resignations. Butler’s victory brings Democrats’ number back to 178, where it was before Evans, a Democrat, resigned. Two Republicans have also resigned this legislative session.
Butler is a transgender woman active in the Seacoast theater community. She told Foster’s Daily Democrat during the campaign that she plans to advocate strongly for the arts and that she “would like to see more people run who do not have divisive agendas, but who really love New Hampshire. I don’t look at this like national politics, because it isn’t. Our legislators are our neighbors, our friends.” During the campaign, she saw attacks from the Committee to Elect House Republicans, which is led by House Majority Leader Jason Osborne, including a website targeting her for her transgender identity and arguing she has radical views on LGBTQ issues.

Tuesday’s forum, held at the Macomb Intermediate School District in Clinton Township, was organized by the Protect MI Care Coalition, a statewide organization of healthcare providers, advocates, and community groups seeking to protect and expand Medicaid access across Michigan. It was held as Congress considers a bill backed by President Donald Trump that would cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid over the next decade.
In May, the coalition sent a letter to Michigan’s congressional delegation outlining how the proposed cuts would impact the lives and livelihoods of their constituents.
Deidra Wilson, senior vice president of government relations and public policy for McLaren Health Care, outlined the risks of simply dismantling Medicaid.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In the latter half of the 20th century, Medicaid emerged as a replacement for state-run institutions, psychiatric hospitals, and asylums. As those facilities were shuttered, Medicaid became the cornerstone of community-based support. As Wilson argued, dismantling that system would leave thousands of Americans isolated and unsupported. 
Many speakers elaborated on the misconceptions surrounding Medicaid– namely what it is, who benefits from it, and what those benefits entail. 
Director of Health and Community Services Andrew Cox pointed out that there’s a lot of confusion between Medicare and Medicaid. The forum and organizations like Protect MI Care Coalition seek to educate the public on the difference.
While Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 and older, Medicaid is slightly more expansive. The program is a joint effort between the state and federal governments, and helps cover healthcare costs for low-income families, seniors, children, and people with disabilities.
As Cox pointed out, most people don’t realize the total number of individuals who benefit from Medicaid. In Macomb County, one in four residents is covered by Medicaid. On the state level, 2.6 million Michigan residents are enrolled in Medicaid, including one-third of Michigan’s rural population.  
Wilson noted that rural communities would be drastically impacted by proposed cuts. McLaren Caro Region Hospital– located in Michigan’s Thumb region– serves nine Michigan counties. More babies are born in the rural Caro hospital than in the more densely populated Genesee County. 
Hospitals like Caro are already strained, and, as the letter to the congressional delegation explained, the proposed Medicaid rollbacks could potentially “overwhelm hospitals, increase uncompensated care costs for providers, and shift the financial burden to communities that can least afford it.”
“I don’t think they have a good understanding of who’s on Medicaid,” Wilson added, referring to proponents of Medicaid rollbacks. “It’s your grocery store clerk, it’s your neighbor, it’s your kids.”

Jennifer VanderMark’s twelve-year-old son is one of the over one million Michigan children who receive Medicaid. VanderMark voiced the universal worry of every parent of a child with a disability: “What is going to happen to them when I am no longer able or no longer alive to care for them? What happens when I’m gone?”
The answer, VanderMark told the forum, is Medicaid. 
“Medicaid will be the foundation upon which he can build a full and happy adult life, even if I’m no longer there to witness it,” she said. 
VanderMark said Medicaid will provide her son with necessary skill-building and supported employment while also ensuring that he’s cared for and comfortable.
She also highlighted the financial and physical struggles that come with caring for a child with disabilities. Some parents are forced to choose between their career and their child’s well-being. The loss of income when one parent is required to be a full-time caregiver can have catastrophic financial consequences. As a result, VanderMark said, retirements are cashed out, credit cards are maxed, and homes go into foreclosure. 
Kim Varga discussed how Medicaid covered her fifteen-year-old daughter’s cancer treatments. 
“She had the opportunity to remain on Medicaid, and it saved her life for a little bit,” Varga explained. “But without that, I would have been paying out of pocket.”
Varga herself is now celebrating over a decade of sobriety, a feat that would have been impossible without Medicaid. 
“I know what it’s like to have bills piled up, going to mental hospitals or regular hospitals with no insurance at all. I know what it’s like to have high-cost medicines. I know what it’s like to be without medicines… They have saved my life,” Varga said.
Megan Callaha, also a Macomb County resident, spoke with Michigan Advance about what the proposed cuts would mean for her mother’s dementia care.
Callahan explained that, while her parents did a lot of financial planning and preparation for retirement, those plans did not include dementia. In the wake of her mother’s diagnosis, Callahan and her family feared they’d have to resort to selling the house or going into debt. They never anticipated enrolling in Medicaid.
She said these services have provided stability and peace of mind for Callahan and her family, and she spoke highly of the memory care community where her mother lives. 
“Brain change could happen to anyone, and these programs have been so vital for my parents’ basic needs. It really helped my father feel assured that my mom can get the best care,” Callahan said
Callahan also noted the stigma surrounding Medicaid, saying her father initially struggled with accepting help for his wife’s care. Now, Callahan said, he’s come to recognize and appreciate that network of support.
“He still worries in different ways,” Callahan added, “At the end of the day, he’ll ask us, ‘Is Mom going to be okay?’ And we can tell him, ‘Yes, Dad — and you’re going to be okay, too.’”

Rokita’s office filed two lawsuits in 2022, accusing TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, of violating Indiana’s Deceptive Consumer Sales Act with its age rating for those 12 and older — claiming that it contained more sexual content, profanity and drug references than advertised.
That made TikTok unsafe for children, he continued. Additionally, he claimed in a separate lawsuit that the company failed to protect user data from the Chinese Communist Party.
An Allen County trial judge initially dismissed the cases before the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed and said the state had jurisdiction to bring the action.
TikTok appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court to dismiss the case, but the justices declined the case by a vote of 3-2. That leaves in place the appellate decision allowing the matter to move forward.
Chief Justice Loretta Rush and Justices Mark Massa and Derek Molter voted to deny, while Justices Christopher Goff and Geoffrey Slaughter would have allowed the appeal.
Attorney Brian Paul, representing TikTok and ByteDance, argued that the Indiana Supreme Court wasn’t the appropriate venue for the case, which is the first issue before the justices.
“Indiana is seeking to punish TikTok for statements that were not made in Indiana, that are not about Indiana, that were not targeted at Indiana and were not tailored to Indiana,” Paul said in his opening remarks.
The state previously argued that justices could intervene because Hoosiers enter into user contracts with TikTok when they download the app.
“TikTok seeks to escape the rules that apply to everyone else, from print magazines to burger franchises,” said Solicitor General James Barta, arguing on behalf of the state.
Barta said that these “daily exchange(s) of data” are used by the plaintiffs to craft “addictive content” based on user locations to earn millions.

Health care costs can quickly add up as a result of a routine check-up or something more serious, like a trip to the emergency room. However, healthcare information shared seamlessly between care team members can help slow costs individually and across Vermont. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  The surprising way you can help slow the growth of health care[...]","Health care costs can quickly add up as a result of a routine check-up or something more serious, like a trip to the emergency room. But what if we told you that there is a way to help control costs individually and across Vermont, just by having your health information shared seamlessly between the members of your care team?
98.9% of Vermonters share health data with their providers through VITL, the state’s independent nonprofit health data network. VITL gives doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, care coordinators, and other qualified health care providers a centralized place to access a more complete, up-to-date patient record, including information from most of the places Vermonters receive care all across the state. This supports your provider in delivering informed, safe, and cost-effective care when and where you need it.
Slowing the growth of health care costs while continuing to provide great care for patients is a shared goal across Vermont, and health data exchange plays a key role in achieving it. How exactly will this sharing help slow the growth in health care costs in the state, and what does health information sharing mean? Let’s take a deeper look.
What is health information sharing?
Health information sharing means that your personal health record, which includes things like medications, allergies, immunizations, test results, diagnoses, and provider notes, is securely shared among the health care professionals who treat you.
Hospitals and providers’ offices keep records of the care they give you; VITL brings these records together. This way, your care team can get a full picture of your health, no matter where in Vermont you’ve received or will receive care. And you don’t have to worry about remembering every past immunization or test result; your record travels with you.
How does health information sharing reduce costs?
When your providers can access a more complete picture of your health, they can avoid unnecessary and costly steps, like ordering duplicate lab tests, prescribing medication that won’t interact well with others you’re taking, or repeating X-rays you’ve already had at another clinic.
For example, if you visit the emergency room, having instant access to your recent lab work and imaging reports means the ER staff won’t need to run those tests again. That can lead to better outcomes for patients and slower growth in health care costs across the state over time.
When essential health data is right at hand, right away, providers and health care staff spend less time making and responding to records requests, freeing up time for care and saving administrative costs. 
Studies conducted across the United States have demonstrated the impact of health data sharing, ranging from reduced hospital readmissions and associated cost savings, to overall reductions in health care spending. In short, health information sharing helps cut down on waste and improve care, benefiting you as well as Vermont’s health care system. 
Is sharing health information safe?
Privacy and security are a priority for VITL and built into every step of the health data exchange process. Only authorized providers and staff of participating health care provider organizations can access your information — and only for specific, approved purposes. Records are also available to public health professionals for their work to keep Vermonters healthy and well. And care managers and other staff at public and private health insurance providers can use VITL data for limited purposes that support timely, high-quality, cost-effective care.

LA-UR-12-21150Raised in Taos, Mariah Blake is a Washington, D.C.-based investigative reporter and the author of an important new book called “They Poisoned the World: Life and Death in the Age of Forever Chemicals.” Her project is the culmination of eight years of research and reporting on forever chemicals, or PFAS — a large class of toxic man-made substances that have been used in a host of consumer products, and that are now in the bloodstream of virtually every living being.

Much of the book focuses on the village of Hoosick Falls, New York, and residents’ decade-long struggle for clean drinking water. But it also exposes the secret history of forever chemicals, some of which is deeply relevant to New Mexico. As Blake explains, PFAS were developed during the Manhattan Project, and serious contamination has occurred at a number of locations in the state, most notably Holloman Air Force Base, ten miles west of Alamogordo. According to researchers at the University of New Mexico, who have been studying the area around Holloman for the past couple of years, wildlife near the base is contaminated with higher levels of PFAS than have been recorded anywhere else in the world.
The source of the contamination is a firefighting foam that has been used since the 1970s at military sites around the world, including Holloman, Cannon Air Force Base, Kirtland Air Force Base, the White Sands Missile Range and Fort Wingate. Scientists say they don’t know where the contamination zone around Holloman ends, and that the PFAS are likely traveling: through the soil, air and water, and also in the bodies of migratory birds, which hunters around the country shoot and eat. The New Mexico Department of Health is advising anyone who consumed birds from the area between 2010 and 2024 to seek medical guidance.
PFAS — or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, as they are formally known — take hundreds or thousands of years to break down in nature. Studies have linked even low levels of PFAS exposure with fertility issues, various cancers, developmental delays, hormone disruption and reduced immune system function. Blake’s book makes clear just how ubiquitous PFAS are in our lives and how dangerous they are, how difficult the remediation will be and how hard ordinary citizens are fighting to repair the damage.

Searchlight: Where did PFAS come from?
Mariah Blake: The U.S. government developed this class of chemicals as part of the Manhattan Project. Most people know the project’s main goal: designing and building the first atomic bomb, with top physicists and engineers working at secret locations around the country, foremost among them, Los Alamos.

But there was another aspect of the program that never registered in history books. It involved some of the leading chemists from all over the country, working with the chemical giant DuPont to develop PFAS, which were then known as fluorocarbons. They were needed for uranium enrichment. They ended up being absolutely essential to the bomb project.
Pretty quickly, chemists were able to develop a variety of methods to manufacture these chemicals on a commercial scale. But it was clear from very early on that they were dangerous. At the plants where they were manufactured, in southwest New Jersey, fires and explosions were common. Workers were constantly being hospitalized with breathing problems or chemical burns. Farmers downwind of the plants started to complain that their peach crops were burning up, that their cows were so crippled they couldn’t stand, that they had to graze by crawling on their bellies. Farm workers who ate the produce they picked fell ill, too.
The farmers’ complaints really alarmed Manhattan Project officials, because they feared that the farmers would sue, and that these lawsuits would compromise the secrecy of the project and open the government up to liability.
At the time, there was already a secret medical research program that looked at Manhattan Project special materials — one study involved injecting unknowing cancer patients with plutonium. As part of that program, the U.S. government started intensely studying the health effects of PFAS. By 1947, they discovered that these substances were highly toxic and that they were accumulating in human blood.
One of the things that makes these chemicals so troubling is that they stay in the human body for many years. This was information that the U.S. government knew before PFAS even went into commercial production.

Searchlight: What happened with PFAS after the war?
Blake: Post-war, the Minnesota-based company 3M acquired patents for technology to produce PFAS, and they hired a team of Manhattan Project chemists to turn them into products that could either be used in manufacturing or sold to the general public. This led to all kinds of innovations, including Scotchgard fabric protector, Gore-Tex and Teflon. These chemicals quickly found their way into thousands of household items, everything from dental floss and kitty litter to contact lenses, children’s clothing, cleaning supplies and beauty products.
In the 1960s, the Navy worked with 3M to develop a specialized firefighting foam. The existing fire retardants just weren’t that effective on fires caused by fuel. The fluorinated foam they developed, which was made with PFAS, was extremely effective. As a result, by the 1970s, the foam was being used at military bases, airports and firehouses all over the world.
Firefighters and service members who handled this material were told that it was safe as soap. Fire houses would throw parties for the community, and they would spray the children with foam. It was used routinely in training and sprayed in areas where there are private wells or public drinking-water wells. It wasn’t only sprayed. It was dumped and spilled in huge quantities. It was discharged into sewer systems. Then the sludge from those systems was spread over millions of acres of agricultural land. The foam was dumped without much thought, because people were told there really was no reason for concern. But as early as 1973, Navy scientists had determined that it was toxic.
This points to an interesting part of New Mexico history: during the 1970s, a team of researchers at Kirtland Air Force Base, in Albuquerque, began testing different methods to filter PFAS out of foam before it was dumped or discharged into sewage systems. They found one that worked. It’s the same technology that’s used to filter PFAS out of drinking water today. But it was never deployed by the U.S. military to prevent pollution around its bases.
Searchlight: How did medical research on PFAS evolve alongside the commercialization of them?
Blake: After the war, Manhattan Project medical research continued under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission. In the 1970s, a scientist working in that program discovered that PFAS were accumulating in the blood of people all across the country. He alerted 3M. 3M then began conducting its own blood studies, looking at thousands of blood samples from around the world, including remote, rural parts of China. It also looked at archived blood samples from past medical studies. The only blood 3M could find that didn’t contain these chemicals was in archived samples from Korean war veterans that was collected before the 1950s, the decade when PFAS went into wide-scale production. This information caused some alarm inside 3M, and the company began intensively studying these chemicals. They quickly discovered that they didn’t break down in the environment, that they had a devastating effect on lab animals and that they were linked to serious diseases in workers. But rather than inform the public or regulators, they buried their findings. This is a pattern that played out over and over and over again for many years.
The Navy did its own research, compiling more data about the toxicity of these substances, but it didn’t disclose this information, either.
Searchlight: What implications does the pollution caused by firefighting foam have for human health and the environment?

Blake: Fluorinated firefighting foam is one of the leading sources of PFAS contamination, not just in the U.S. but worldwide. Some of the most severe pollution is around military bases, where this material was routinely used for training. Groundwater around many bases contains levels of PFAS that are thousands, even millions of times higher than the EPA safety limit. This level of pollution is seen almost nowhere else.
A kangaroo rat that was captured at Holloman Lake, which adjoins the Air Force Base, showed PFAS levels that were 30 million times the EPA safety standard. That blows away every other number I’ve seen in my decade of reporting on PFAS. It’s worth noting that, at Holloman, scientists are only testing for 17 of the 9,000 PFAS in circulation in the U.S. Other studies have shown that there are several hundred different PFAS in groundwater and drinking water near military bases. The study of these chemicals near Holloman probably underestimated the level of contamination by a large margin.
Because PFAS don’t break down in the environment, and they’re highly mobile, sites like this are more akin to Fukushima, the site of major nuclear meltdown, than a regular toxic waste site. They radiate contamination. PFAS move through the environment quickly: through the air, through water in the underground aquifers. Animal species are absorbing enormous quantities, and that moves up the food chain.

Searchlight: What tools do we have to clean up heavily contaminated sites like Holloman?
Blake: They are really limited. There are technologies that can filter some of these chemicals out of drinking water, but not all, and what you end up with is a concentrated stew of PFAS that you then either put in a landfill — but all landfills eventually leak — or incinerate. However, if these chemicals aren’t incinerated at a high enough heat, they just break down into smaller PFAS and spread all over. There are only three incinerators in the entire country that are capable of destroying PFAS.
Scientists are now using Holloman as a laboratory to study how PFAS from firefighting foam moves through the environment. That is probably the best possible use of that land, because it will be contaminated for generations.
Searchlight: What is the Pentagon’s stance on remediating PFAS contamination around military bases?
Blake: The expense of cleaning up these sites — if it’s even possible — is going to be mammoth. The Pentagon has fought in various ways to avoid having to do it.
It’s fought to kill PFAS regulation on the federal level. It has also refused to comply with all kinds of state regulations, as well as EPA mandates, on PFAS. PFAS contamination first really registered on the radar in New Mexico around 2018 when a dairy farmer named Art Schaap, whose farm is right next to Cannon Air Force Base, discovered that the water on his farm was highly contaminated. He ended up having to slaughter 3,500 head of cattle. His operation, Highland Dairy, supplied milk for the public schools in Albuquerque. Schaap was very vocal, and state officials responded by setting cleanup standards around Cannon. The Pentagon actually sued New Mexico for trying to enforce cleanup standards, claiming that it didn’t have the authority.
The Pentagon eventually backed down. But now the Department of Defense has asked a federal judge to dismiss dozens of lawsuits that have been brought against it, for its role in contaminating drinking water and soil around military bases. One was brought by the state of New Mexico. These are just a few examples of various ways that DOD has tried to evade responsibility for the contamination around its sites.
Searchlight: What lessons can people in New Mexico learn from the people in Hoosick Falls, New York, and their successful fight for clean drinking water?
Blake: I focused at length on Hoosick Falls, where the water is polluted with PFAS from a local Teflon coating factory. But I could just as easily have focused on any number of communities around the country, because variations of the same story are playing out all over. People in Georgia, in Maine, in Arizona, in Alaska — people from all over the country whose lives have been devastated by PFAS — are channeling their anguish into advocacy. They’re accomplishing things that I wouldn’t have considered possible when I started researching my book.
I mentioned earlier that it was largely a dairy farmer named Art Schaap who put PFAS on the radar in New Mexico. He has also advocated for change on a national level. He was part of a contingent of unlikely activists from all over the country who traveled to Washington, D.C., in 2019 to lobby lawmakers to pass a host of bills related to PFAS. As a result of citizen pressure, that year Congress passed a law requiring that fluorinated firefighting foams be phased out on U.S. military bases. In addition, 30 states have passed more than 155 bills, including 16 full or partial bans on the entire class of chemicals in consumer goods. Thirty-three states have passed or are weighing bans on all PFAS in firefighting foam. This is a paradigm shift. This is not how we usually regulate chemicals in this country: normally, we regulate them one by one.

There’s also a huge amount of litigation happening. Currently, more than 15,000 lawsuits are pending against manufacturers, and there are a growing number of lawsuits against consumer brands. This is all causing major shifts in the market as large swaths of the economy voluntarily migrate away from forever chemicals. 3M, the world’s largest manufacturer of PFAS, has announced that it will quit producing them this year.
By the way, I was there in 2019 when Schaap went to Washington. The people I followed from Hoosick Falls were also there. There was a farmer from Maine. There were factory workers. It was amazing to see how lawmakers responded to people telling their stories. It goes beyond politics and partisan divides, hearing the stories of people whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by these chemicals.
Searchlight: How did your history in New Mexico shape the way you approached your book?
Blake: I grew up in Taos. Both sides of my family have been there since the 1950s. My grandfather on my father’s side, Ernie Blake, moved there to build Taos Ski Valley. What most people don’t realize is that he was a German Jew who fled Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. That was not something he spoke about publicly. But he was obsessed with history, particularly military history, and I think some of that obsession rubbed off on me, which is why I felt compelled to delve so deeply into some historical aspects of the forever chemical saga, including the Manhattan Project story.

Gratz for Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska auditor on Wednesday flagged “widespread misuse” of state-owned vehicles — including allegations of an employee taking multiple trips to his family’s vineyard and winery and another in which a worker used a state car to “gallivant” around Lincoln for his side business.
In a 38-page report, the State Auditor’s Office focused on 2024 and on a slice of the vehicles handled by the Department of Administrative Services’ Transportation Services Bureau, which controls about 1,200 of the state’s 4,000 vehicles. The TSB leases vehicles to state agency personnel for official government use on an as-needed basis, racking up about 15 million miles a year.
  State Auditor Mike Foley. (Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)
A test sample of 45 fleet vehicles equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking devices revealed, according to the report, that nearly a third, 14 vehicles, were allegedly used for personal purposes such as trips to retail outlets, restaurants, medical facilities, residences of relatives, commuting home without permission and other private errands that the auditor team determined had nothing to do with official duties.
State Auditor Mike Foley pointed out that Nebraska law prohibits a state officer or employee from using a state-owned vehicle for personal use. He said violators face a potential criminal misdemeanor charge and removal from office or employment.
“Joy-riding in state-owned vehicles — on the taxpayer’s dime, no less — is obviously a common occurrence and, despite my office’s previous reporting on it, appears to be continuing unabated,” Foley said in a statement. “Installing GPS trackers in the state’s cars is a very good idea, but those devices are practically worthless if agencies fail to review the resulting data.”
 Menards rebates

Foley spotlighted, for example, a Nebraska Department of Natural Resources worker from Scottsbluff who allegedly took multiple trips in a state vehicle to his family’s vineyard and who also allegedly redeemed Menards work purchase rebates for his own use.
The review noted that two different employees appeared to have used rebates on state purchases for personal gain.
“Personal use of a state-owned vehicle sometimes coincides with other improper activities,” Foley said, noting that such rebates belong to the government agency purchasing the items and are “tantamount to theft.” 
Foley alleged that an investigator with the Department of Correctional Services used an assigned state vehicle to make trips for his side business to a Scheels store and to see a customer. 











Joy-riding in state-owned vehicles — on the taxpayer’s dime, no less — is obviously a common occurrence and, despite my office’s previous reporting on it, appears to be continuing unabated,. 


– Mike Foley, Nebraska State Auditor of Public Accounts



He said investigating misuse of state cars was, at times, like “peeling an onion — stripping back that underlying criminal offense can expose even more wrongdoing, such as using a TSB fleet vehicle to further a private business venture.”
In another instance, the audit team claimed that a medical services specialist with the Department of Health and Human Services drove a state-owned car more than 1,000 miles for personal use, including to his home, wife’s workplace and restaurants.
Foley said he found particularly disturbing the”ongoing nature” of a problem he said his team has reported on before. A year ago, Foley’s office issued findings of alleged misuse of state vehicles assigned to the Board of Parole. 
Also in an audit last year, Foley’s office reviewed vehicle use by the Nebraska Department of Transportation, uncovering what he said were “implausible” trips and thousands of revisions on travel reports.
On Wednesday, he urged “aggressive action” including analyzing GPS data on a regular basis, and noted that his latest report had examined only a “fraction” of state cars. 
“Extrapolate those findings to the entire population of state-owned vehicles and there can be no doubt that these continuous improprieties are costing taxpayers an obscene amount of money, not to mention constituting a particularly brazen flouting of the law,” Foley said.
The auditor report included responses from some state employees to accusations. One worker said stops to a Hy-Vee, Dollar General and Walmart were taken during her break while working. The auditor noted that each instance was more than 15 minutes, one more than an hour.
About stopping at restaurants on the way home from work, the auditor said employees should have returned home with the state vehicle and then used a personal vehicle to go to the restaurant.
 Some agencies push back

The State Department of Education noted that the additional mileage in a case involving its staff was four miles that resulted in an additional cost of $1.40. The Education Department said using a state vehicle compared to the employee’s personal vehicle saved the state roughly $165 in mileage expenses for the trip. To that, the auditor said the potential cost of the action is “not a valid justification” for violating a law.

Foley said DAS, the overseer of state-owned vehicles, “promised to double-down on its oversight.”
Several individual agencies, regarding situations flagged with its employees, said in the report they were offering additional training and education, refining procedures and taking other action based on the auditor’s recommendations.
The Department of Natural Resources said, for example, it would discipline identified team members and seek reimbursement for store rebates. 
Other departments pushed back on certain findings. 
The Department of Revenue, for example, said that while it emphasizes taking meal breaks toward the middle of the workday, it wanted to avoid scenarios where inspectors “are entirely deprived of a meal period because work commitments have made a late lunch the only reasonable alternative.”
While the State Fire Marshal said it would continue internal monitoring of timesheets and vehicle data to determine if policy changes are needed, it noted that managers were unable to substantiate the auditor’s finding of using a vehicle for personal purposes.
Among highlights of the auditor’s report:

On travel logs, the report alleged that 13 of the 45 vehicles tested were incomplete, missing information such as days traveled, destination, signatures and proof the trip was for state business.


On vehicles assigned for a 24-hour period, six of 16 cases examined showed the employees did not have written approval from TSB and that they drove the state vehicle home.

They need to act soon to prioritize our nation’s financial stability and reassure global markets that we take this responsibility seriously.”Both the House and Senate are scheduled to be in recess Aug. 4 through Sept. 2.Global crisis loomsIf Congress does not act, the U.S. would default on its debt for the first time, likely leading to a global financial crisis.As of June 18, the federal treasury had $384 billion in cash on hand and could save another $89 billion through “extraordinary measures,” the term for accounting tricks the government can use to save cash in an emergency.The exact date will depend on how much the government spends in July and August — months that typically see large deficits, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.If the government can avoid the debt limit until quarterly taxes are due on Sept. 15, those receipts would likely give more breathing room until early October, the center said.Other factors that could influence the X-date include fluctuating tariff revenue and the potential for costly hurricanes this summer.Big beautiful debt limit increaseThe reconciliation package Republicans in Congress are racing to send to President Donald Trump’s desk by July Fourth includes a raise in the debt limit. The version that passed the House would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, while the Senate version would increase it by $5 trillion.Republican senators are scrambling this week to revamp several pieces of the legislative package as the chamber’s parliamentarian rules that some do not meet the strict rules for what can be considered under the fast-track procedure known as budget reconciliation.The process allows the Senate to pass the bill with a simple majority, meaning Republicans could pass it without Democratic votes. But Republicans are still haggling among themselves over provisions to aid rural hospitals amid changes to Medicaid, sell off public lands and others.Once passed in the Senate, either the House would have to approve that version or both chambers would have to vote on some kind of compromise language before Trump could sign the bill.",,,,2025-06-25 14:08:28.938232

Over the years, he’s seen the evolution of healthcare near his town of about 2,000 people. When he got elected to the North Carolina Senate, he wanted to make a difference.
“I realized I had to work in health care space… I put health care up there, education, agriculture,” Davis.
He went in thinking his work on the Senate Health Care Committee would be easy, that everybody would agree. Instead, it was “one of the most contentious committees” on which he’s ever worked.
Davis mentioned fighting to expand Medicaid and keep the East Carolina high risk pregnancy center open.
“There’s the greatest health care disparities, we tend to see all of this in eastern North Carolina,” he said.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)The 19-year-old counter-protester arrested at Nashville’s No Kings Rally on June 14 was flagged two months earlier by a federal terrorism task force after posting an image on social media of a shotgun inscribed with “names of mass shooters and Neo-Nazi symbology,” according to Murfreesboro police.
Elijah Millar, of Murfreesboro, was arrested by Nashville police at the rally and charged with disorderly conduct after witnesses reported he brandished a handgun. Police seized a pistol from Millar at the scene.
Murfreesboro police arrested Millar three days later and charged him with three counts of unlawful possession of a weapon, a misdemeanor. Millar also faces a federal charge for unlawful possession of a firearm.
Millar, who has been treated for mental health conditions for several years, has been under conservatorship since 2023 after Rutherford County Chancery Court judges found him to be a “disabled person needing care” and “at risk of substantial harm to his health, safety and welfare.” The conservatorship restricts his access to firearms, according to court documents.

A detective with the Murfreesboro Police Department received a tip from the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force on April 3, reporting that Millar made a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, of the inscribed shotgun along with a small revolver, according to court documents obtained by Tennessee Lookout.
When police visited Millar’s home, Millar’s mother — his conservator — voluntarily gave police both firearms, telling them that “he purchased the firearms from a gun show without her consent,” the affidavit states.
Millar’s conservatorship requires him to be accompanied by his mother or step-father to purchase weapons and he cannot purchase or store weapons of any kind without his mother’s consent, according to federal court documents.
Millar’s federal public defender could not be immediately reached. Attempts to contact Millar’s mother were unsuccessful.
On June 16, two days after Millar was arrested at the Nashville protest, police received a call alleging that Millar made suicidal statements. Police met Millar outside his home and confiscated a loaded handgun from his waistband and a loaded magazine from his pocket. When police contacted Millar’s mother via phone, she told them she “was unaware of Mr. Millar having the Walther handgun, again violating the conservatorship.”
Millar was taken to the hospital for mental health treatment and police arrested him when he was released on June 17 for possessing the three weapons in violation of his conservatorship.
Federal prosecutors argued for Millar’s detention in a June 22 filing, citing “social media posts and online activity (that) have raised concerns amongst law enforcement that the Defendant has a desire to commit an act of mass violence.”
Miller is set to remain in custody at Rutherford County Adult Detention Center. If he is released from state custody, he will be transferred to federal custody, where he will remain until his federal trial, according to a federal court order.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s political leaders are known for boasting that they have the best state in the nation. Some studies have even awarded it with that title. U.S. News & World Report has awarded it best in the nation three years in a row (2023, 2024, and 2025). WalletHub awarded it 4th happiest and overall 4th best state in 2024.
One ranking authority took the novel approach of listing what each state is the worst at among all 50 states, in an apparent attempt to show states are not always what they are cracked up to be. Utah was found to be the “nerdiest” state in the union, in part because of the heavy participation of its residents in “gaming.” While other states got hit hard with real deficiencies, the researchers seem not to have been able to find too much wrong with Utah.
However, in reality Utah seems to be challenging a number of the named worst performing states with clear indications of its own very poor performance. For example, New Jersey is dinged for raking in excessive amounts of money by giving out the most speeding tickets. However, a Utah TV station recently featured a story about Utah’s own notorious problem of “super speeders.”
Oregon has the prize for highest rate of prescription pain killer abuse, but Utah has long been at or near the bottom in this indicator of despair and unhappiness as well. Utah had the 7th highest drug overdose rate in the U.S. between 2013 and 2015. Prescription overdose deaths in Utah have increased 400% since 2000. Fentanyl deaths per year increased from 23 in 2014 to 290 in 2023, an 1160% increase.
North Carolina is named the worse state for education. However, Utah has long had near the lowest or the lowest per-pupil spending in public schools. Also, Salt Lake City’s own University of Utah was recently ranked second from the bottom among hundreds of universities in “political awareness” of its student body, surely an indicator of the poor quality of civics education in the state.
Utah has long been relatively bereft of direct air travel routes to international destinations east and west. Recently, Salt Lake City opened up its first direct-to-Asia link in over 15 years, to Inchon, South Korea. Aside from increasing passenger travel, Mayor Mendenhall says this will also facilitate cargo transport bringing familiar electronic products to Utah and also open up new trade opportunities. However, the mayor did not mention the obvious huge negative factor in the equation stemming from our current tariff battles with Asian countries.
Utah has other negative distinctions that the “worst state” study was not able to focus on. For example, Utah recently had the second highest short-term consumer loan rates in the nation, thus breaking with the Biblical Christian tradition of not exploiting the “widow,” the “fatherless,” and the “poor.”
Utah also has a severe problem with teen suicide. Some 25 teens a day attempt suicide in Utah, according to The Hope Hero Foundation, which reports suicide rates have risen over 71% over the past decade for youth ages 10-24.
While Utah is often cited for lower-than-average crime rates, Utah has long been a hub for featuring outrageous murderers, boasting a long-string of famous killers like Mark Hoffman, Ronnie Lee Gardner, Gary Gilmore, Barton Kay Kirkham, and the notorious serial murderer Ted Bundy. In addition, college students at the state’s main public university, University of Utah, have proved to be all-too-easy marks for preventable murders, as was the case with Lauren McCluskey.
Utah also seems to have sidelined its long-time civic spiritual pride in favor of Tower of Babel-style materialism and sports entertainment above all other priorities. It first added major league basketball, then major league hockey, and soon a major league baseball team to its long-term major-league snow skiing capacity. Utah also has downtown building plans aplenty, including luxury housing, office space for medium-size corporations, a major new hospital, a sports entertainment complex, a university extension facility, and a global religious headquarters with seismic upgrades. Utah also has plans for a plethora of nuclear energy facilities, an interconnected urban trails system, and an expensive plan for ferrying skiers up the canyon.
Utah is also known for its monopoly political party which regularly participates in illegal gerrymandering efforts and easily discoverable efforts to skew voter sentiment, such as failing to adhere to proper voter notification requirements for a constitutional amendment.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/012624_Senate_03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 13:13:03.549915

After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.

After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.










We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.

Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”

New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

The helicopter was flying low above a remote snow-covered mountain ridge outside Hinton, Alberta, Canada, when pilot Clay Wilson jumped the wolves and gave chase.

Carter Niemeyer picked the tranquilizer gun off his lap and sighted through the opening where the helicopter’s passenger side door had been removed especially for the mission.
Less than 50 feet below, a 9-month-old wolf pup broke into a run, bounding through the December snowpack.
His coat was the color of coal.

This is the first installment of Howl, a five-part written series and podcast season produced in partnership between the Idaho Capital Sun, States Newsroom and Boise State Public Radio.

Even though the pup wasn’t yet a year old, he weighed 83 pounds and had developed a thick coat that would help him endure his first winter in the mountains.
The chopper made a pass at the wolf and doubled back, but Niemeyer wasn’t close enough to fire a dart loaded with tranquilizer drugs.
After essentially killing off all wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains by the 1930s, the United States government sent Niemeyer and a small team to Canada just over 30 years ago to sedate, catch, study and reintroduce wolves to the American West, where wolves were a native species.



Wilson and Niemeyer had never flown together before this flight took off in December 1994.
Niemeyer was an experienced government trapper and wildlife biologist with a United States government agency called Animal Damage Control (which later changed its name to USDA Wildlife Services), but he had never been to Hinton and didn’t know his way around Alberta’s Northern Rockies.
To make matters worse, the local tranquilizer gunners the government hired for the mission hadn’t shown up yet.
Niemeyer was supposed to be on the ground, carrying wolves out of the snow to a safe spot to land the helicopter after the wolves were darted from the air.
“I was mostly mugging,” Niemeyer said. “The mugger is the guy who you dump out in snow 20 feet deep. And you roll and crawl and drag yourself through this ungodly deep snow, sometimes where just the little tops of the pine trees were sticking out, because the wolves get darted in there and you can’t land (a helicopter). It’s too dangerous, between snags and deep snow that could collapse. So the mugger, you’ve got to get that wolf out of that deep snow situation, down the slope and try and drag them to river ice, somewhere where you’ve got a footing, where the helicopter can land securely.”
An average adult male wolf weighs about 100 pounds.
The largest wolf caught for wolf reintroduction in 1995 and 1996 weighed 135 pounds, Niemeyer said.
“And, yeah, talk about a workout,” Niemeyer said. “Sometimes it was something else.”
 Capturing wolves in Canada to release them into Yellowstone, Frank Church wilderness

The reason Niemeyer was in Hinton is because the U.S. government decided to bring back wolves after a decades-long extermination campaign.
The controversial plan called for Niemeyer and the reintroduction team to capture gray wolves from Canada and release them in Yellowstone National Park and the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho.
And the only way to do so was by hand.
But when Niemeyer showed up to Canada searching for wolves to bring back to the Lower 48, he found the local trappers who were supposed to be capturing live wolves for collaring and medical exams had grown distrustful of the American government.
Instead of caring for live wolves, the local trappers were killing them.
“The guys were killing them, skinning them and putting them on stretching boards and then I got up there and met them, and we had a confrontation, me and them, and they told me (to) take my truck and get the hell out of town,” Niemeyer said.
An already tense situation in Canada came to a head when a local trapper hauled in two dead wolves and threw them at Niemeyer’s feet.
Standing 6 feet, 6 inches tall and fond of wearing a mustache and a fur trappers hat, Niemeyer wasn’t one to back down from a challenge.
Since he was a boy following in his father’s footsteps, Niemeyer had trapped, skinned or taxidermied just about every predator and varmint in the West.
It started with pocket gophers – 10 cents a head.
That night he ended up squaring off with a local trapper in a drunken wolf skinning competition inside the man’s cabin.
It had been about 60 years since the wolves’ howl fell silent across the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
If wolves were going to make a comeback, things were off to a bad start.
 Wolves driven out of the Rocky Mountains

Wolves are a keystone species of apex predators that ranged from the Arctic, down through the Rocky Mountains and plains of the United States and into Mexico for thousands of years.
There used to be tens of thousands of wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.

But thanks to government bounties meant to encourage westward expansion, settlers used trapping and widespread poisoning to kill off virtually every wolf in the American West by the 1930s.
Between 1914 and 1926, at least 136 wolves were killed in Yellowstone, including two wolf pups killed in 1926 near a geologic feature named Soda Butte.
Yellowstone National Park reports that the last wolf pack in the park was killed in 1926.
It wasn’t hunters or poachers who killed off the last Yellowstone wolves.
It was park rangers.
Congress had put up $125,000 to remove wolves and other predators from public lands, and it worked.
The Idaho Department of Fish and Game says the last wolf in Idaho was believed to have been killed in the 1930s.
Wolves survived in Alaska, Canada and Minnesota but they were functionally extinct in the Western U.S.
Then things began to change for wolves in 1974, slowly at first.
Four subspecies of gray wolves, including the gray wolf of the Northern Rocky Mountains, were listed under the Endangered Species Act, which had just been signed into law the year before by President Richard Nixon.
Dozens of conservation groups, nonprofit organizations, biologists, veterinarians and members of the public pushed to save and restore wolves.
Meanwhile ranchers, hunters, politicians across Idaho, Montana and Wyoming and countless residents of small rural communities pushed just as hard in the opposite direction.
By 1980, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery plan recommended reintroducing wolves to Central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park.
As the federal government set wolf reintroduction in motion, hunters and ranchers vehemently opposed the plan. They warned of conflicts between humans, wolves and livestock.
 ‘Wolf ground zero’: How wolves and livestock can collide in the West

Ranchers said the loss of livestock like sheep and cattle would threaten to wipe out generations-old family businesses.
They were already struggling with the thinnest of margins and facing uncertainties like drought.
They didn’t need wolves eating their livestock.
“We have family stories from my grandfather and great grandfather about the first generation of wolves and how they warned us about keeping them away from our livestock, and how important it was to not have livestock interactions with wolves,” said Jay Smith, owner of J Lazy S Angus Ranch in Carmen, Idaho. “So we have that long, long family history of knowledge on top of our own.”
Smith is a fourth-generation rancher. His ancestors first bought a ranch on Carmen Creek in 1924.

His own ranch is located a few ridges over from Corn Creek in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness – the original site of wolf reintroduction in Idaho in 1995.
Smith calls the area “wolf ground zero.”
From the ranch, Smith can gaze across the valley and see the Diamond Moose grazing allotment. It was one of the first – and remains one of the most consistent – sites of conflict between wolves and livestock, Smith said.
“There’s no rhyme or reason,” Smith said. “You know, in 30 years, we never know what to expect. One year we’ll lose 20 head of cattle, and one year we’ll lose zero. And we just never quite know how to explain or how to do better, or how to mitigate that risk.”
 Tense public meetings showed just how controversial wolf reintroduction was, not just to the West, but to the world

Ranchers weren’t the only ones worried about wolf reintroduction.
Hunters warned the return of wolves would lead to the decimation of elk herds, which would threaten a way of life for generations of passionate hunters.
A series of heated wolf reintroduction public meetings played out in cities and small towns across Idaho, Wyoming and Montana in the 1990s.
Yellowstone National Park staff reported that over about 2.5 years, the team developing the environmental impact state conducted more than 130 meetings and considered more than 160,000 public comments, which came in from all 50 states and 40 foreign countries.
Several people in the room during those meetings described increasingly tense hearings, where emotion and fear trumped science and reason.
“Working with wolves all the years I did before coming here, you can’t underestimate human hatred of wolves,” said Doug Smith, a biologist who led wolf reintroduction and monitoring in Yellowstone for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022. “I mean reason, compromise, facts, science doesn’t even dent people’s attitudes about (wolves).”
“Prior to wolves being listed as an endangered species, they weren’t just killed, they were tortured,” Smith continued. “People cut their lower jaws off and set them free, and they died that way. They would wire their jaws shut. They would take nails or razor blades and put it in hunks of meat… So they’d swallow the razor blades and nails. This is human hatred.”
Some wolf meetings ended in screaming matches.
But in 1994, former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt authorized the reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park and Central Idaho.
“It was a long slog,” Smith said. “Wolves were listed in 1974, so it was a 20 year process to get wolves back.”
After it became clear wolf reintroduction was going to happen, Doug Smith landed his dream job in 1994 – becoming a wolf project biologist at Yellowstone National Park. There were no wolves there yet, but he was there to lay the groundwork for reintroduction.
Within two years, Smith was named leader of the Yellowstone Wolf Project.
“If you’d studied wolves at all, or carnivores at all, it was the biggest opportunity in decades to come along,” Smith said. “I mean, wolves are eradicated from Yellowstone by the government. The government decides to restore them. It’s the largest intact temperate zone ecosystem in the world, and the government’s going to undertake wolf reintroduction – as controversial a thing as you can get.”
 Howling for wolves – and a wake up call

Babbitt’s authorization to reintroduce wolves didn’t ease the tension.
Shortly before wolf reintroduction, Suzanne Asha Stone and a team of researchers were surveying the land where the wolves would be reintroduced in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.
Stone is the co-founder of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network. At the time, she was an intern working for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a member of the wolf reintroduction team.
After landing a small plane on a wilderness airstrip, the researchers received a report of a wolf sighting in an area called Bear Valley, just outside of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.
“Dr. (Steven) Fritz was teaching me how to howl for wolves,” Stone said. “That’s how we used to look for wolves before there were more of the digital type recordings that you would play for them. You just go out and do some howling. And so he was teaching me how to do that. And it was my first time to go solo.”
“We were on a Forest Service road out in the backcountry on the national forest and I got to my second howl, and we had rifle bullets just zing right over the top of our heads,” Stone said.
Nobody was hurt, and Stone still doesn’t know if the shooters knew people were in the area.
But the episode served as a wakeup call, a visceral reminder of how deep wolf hatred ran for some.
By the time Stone and the reintroduction team arrived in Salmon to prepare to reintroduce wolves in Idaho, Stone was concerned for the team’s safety and worried about the potential for violence.
Members of the reintroduction team began to travel with an armed guard.
“We’d already received death threats in town from people’s signs,” Stone said. “They were handwritten. And it said, ‘kill all the wolves and all the people who brought them here.’”
 ‘Carter’s Hope’: How one man and one wolf made the West a little more wild

Babbitt’s signature cleared the way for Carter Niemeyer and the reintroduction team to head to Hinton in November 1994.
And that brings us back to that alcohol-fueled wolf-skinning competition.
Niemeyer, refusing to blink, won the competition with the local trappers and earned their respect. That’s when the capture and reintroduction mission finally got off the ground.
With his credibility firmly established, Niemeyer got in touch with Clay Wilson, a helicopter pilot out of Cranbrook, British Columbia.
Niemeyer and Wilson hoped to search for wolves by air, dart them with tranquilizers fired from the helicopter and then fit the wolves with radio collars.
Once the captured wolves were temporarily released again, the radio collars would help the reintroduction team track the wolves to the location of the larger pack.
But the gunners hired for the operation hadn’t arrived yet.
Wilson decided to take a test flight and invited Niemeyer.
Niemeyer was a seasoned hunter and government trapper who had experience using sedative drugs like telazol and ketamine.
But he did not know the area or have any leads on local wolves.
“When the pilots got there they go, ‘So do we have anybody who knows how to gun that could go ride with us to go dart a wolf?’” Niemeyer said. “And I was the only one.”
The team took two helicopters up.
Wilson and Niemeyer eventually spotted a group of three or four wolves, including that 9-month-old male pup with the thick black winter coat.
After several passes, Wilson flew in low and Niemeyer finally fired at the running pup.
The dart struck the wolf on one its front paws – just barely.
Wilson landed the helicopter, and Niemeyer sprang after the young wolf.
The wolf was only partially sedated, still staggering and thrashing through the snow.
After a mad dash, Niemeyer got close enough to slip a catchpole over the wolf and administer another round of drugs to sedate it.

It was a moment he will never forget: Niemeyer had just darted and captured the first wolf for reintroduction in America.
“I named it Carter’s Hope, because it was the first wolf we caught up in Canada by darting,” Niemeyer said. “And I was just being silly and called it Carter’s Hope. Hoping that this was the beginning of a successful project, which it turned out to be.”
Once the wolves were darted and captured, they were sent to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park, where they underwent medical examinations, were given vaccinations and tested for disease.
During exams, the wolves were given numbered radio collars that allowed biologists or park rangers to track the wolf’s location.
Idaho elementary school students decorated collars for each of the wolves bound for Central Idaho.
Each collar has a different number and Carter’s Hope, who was bound for Yellowstone, received collar number 15. (Niemeyer said the collars don’t have any negative effects on the wolves who wear them.)
After his capture, Carter’s Hope was flown to Montana and then driven to Yellowstone National Park in January 1995.

As the horse trailers carrying Carter’s Hope and the other wolves entered Yellowstone’s North Entrance at Gardiner, Montana, and passed under the iconic Roosevelt Arch, crowds of people lining the side of the road cheered and waved.
 A soft release into Yellowstone country

Carter’s Hope became one of the original members of the Soda Butte Pack, one of the first three packs of wild wolves to live in Yellowstone in nearly 70 years.
Initially, the Yellowstone wolves were kept in one-acre acclimation pens, set back from the park’s roads, as part of a so-called soft release.
“We were on the receiving team, so our job was to take care of the wolves in the pens for 10 weeks. That meant visiting them twice a week, every week, to feed them, check on them, and then release them,” Smith said.
Yellowstone staffers used horse-drawn sleds to haul animal carcasses to the pens to feed the wolves.
  After they were captured in Canada, the wolves released in Yellowstone National Park initially stayed in acclimation pens, like this wolf pictured in Crystal Creek on Jan. 26, 1996. (Photo courtesy of Jim Peaco/Yellowstone National Park)
But outside of the temporary acclimation pens where the new wolves were first held upon reintroduction, Yellowstone National Park is wild landscape with no fences – the park boundary is an invisible line.
After the wolves were released from Yellowstone’s acclimation pens in March 1995, Carter’s Hope didn’t stay within the boundaries of Yellowstone, where rangers patrolled and poaching was almost unheard of. Wolves were still listed as an endangered species in 1995, but protecting them in the vast tracts of national forest and ranchland outside of the park would be a challenge.
After Carter’s Hope and the Soda Butte Pack left the park in April 1995, Niemeyer and Smith worried the wolves could be at risk of poaching anytime they strayed beyond Yellowstone’s invisible boundaries.
“We’ve learned through decades of wolf research that making it illegal to kill wolves doesn’t stop people from killing them,” Smith said in an interview in the Yellowstone backcountry. “Wolves are one of those cultural lightning rods that a ton of society doesn’t care about what the rules are. They hate wolves so much they’re going to shoot them. And you know, a country like this that I’m looking out upon is broken country. It’s forested. The wolves have got a chance to get away from human killing. (But) ringing the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is a sea of humanity, and it’s open country. And what I mean by open county is no place to hide. People jump on four wheelers. People jump in pickup trucks, and they’ll run them down… Yeah, they run them down with snowmobiles, or four wheelers. Or they get close enough where they can take a rifle shot on them when there’s no place to hide. And there’s no place to hide all around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.”
Aside from poaching, Smith and Niemeyer worried about wildlife control officers killing wolves if the wolves killed livestock outside of the park.
It turns out, it was only a matter of time.
The first report came in December 1995 – wolves killed a dog in Fishtail, Montana.
By spring and early summer 1996, wolves had killed sheep on a ranch about 30 miles north of Yellowstone’s border.
This time, Niemeyer was able to capture Carter’s Hope and bring the wolf back to a Yellowstone acclimation pen for two more months.
While Carter’s Hope was in the pen, a young visitor took notice.

Wolf 26, a female wolf pup from the Nez Perce Pack, began hanging around the pen.
Wolf 26 was one of the wolves brought to Yellowstone from Canada during the second year of reintroduction, in 1996, Yellowstone National Park records show.
After inching closer and closer, Wolf 26 and Carter’s Hope touched noses through the fence in the pen, Niemeyer wrote in his memoir, “Wolfer.”
No longer a part of the Soda Butte Pack, Carter’s Hope paired off with Wolf 26 after he was re-released from the pen on Sept. 27, 1996.
Along with humans, wolves are among the few mammals that form long-term pair bonds – often remaining together for life, raising pups jointly and sharing food.
Carter’s Hope and Wolf 26 stayed together and traveled throughout the southern portions of Yellowstone National Park through the end of 1996, Yellowstone records show.
Eventually the two wolves left Yellowstone, heading south to Wyoming, where Wolf 26 had five pups.
The new pack was named the Washakie Pack.
Carter’s Hope had become an alpha wolf and made history.
“He did successfully acclimate to being a wild wolf and got away from livestock, and he became the first breeding male wolf to establish a pack in the state of Wyoming,” Niemeyer said.
 A long line of descendants – and fear for the future

But two years after Carter’s Hope arrived in Yellowstone, ranchers reported more calves were killed near the Washakie Pack’s territory.
This time, Niemeyer couldn’t save the wolf.
Carter’s Hope was shot and killed by a USDA Wildlife Services officer in October 1997 for killing livestock outside of Yellowstone National Park, according to the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s 1998 annual report.
Although wolves were still an endangered species, animal control officers tracked and killed Carter’s Hope under rules established to reduce conflict with ranchers.
Niemeyer still thinks killing Carter’s Hope was unnecessary.

“I was upset, and I was saddened,” Niemeyer said. “I was disappointed.”
But he also realized the place Carter’s Hope holds in history.
Carter’s Hope was one of the 66 wolves captured in Canada released in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in 1995 and 1996.
“He made it a couple, three years, but he did have pups, and that’s a nice thing with wolves – they’re prolific animals, and some of his progeny lived to see another day,” Niemeyer said.
Today, just over 30 years later, there are an estimated 2,800 wolves in the Western United States.
Almost all of them descended from Carter’s Hope and the other 65 other wolves that a small team of biologists, veterinarians, trappers, pilots and conservationists reintroduced to America.
Today, 30 years removed from reintroduction, Niemeyer, Stone and Smith say wolves are in danger once more. Wolves were removed from the Endangered Species List in 2011.
Now, Niemeyer, Smith and Stone worry about increased hunting and trapping and new government programs enacted in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming that are intended to reduce the wolf population.
“I am worried about the future, because the most important thing for wolf restoration is human attitudes, and human attitudes have not changed about wolves,” Smith said. “One of my favorite sound bites when I started working in Yellowstone 30 years ago was, ‘I hope in 30 years, some of the controversy has died down, and people have gotten used to the ideas that wolves aren’t that bad.’ And that hasn’t happened at all. They are still hated as much as they were 30 years ago. They’re still a political football. They’re still controversial.”
Journalists Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin reported and wrote Howl over the course of 14 months, trekking deep into the backcountry in some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 chasing the story of America’s wildest and most controversial wildlife comeback story – wolf reintroduction.

Mike Braun appears at the Mid-America Regulatory Conference in downtown Indianapolis on Tuesday, June 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun on Wednesday announced the creation of a task force to plan for how the state will meet growing demand for energy.
It was part of an executive order he signed last week and uploaded Wednesday.
“Indiana’s economy is growing, and we need new solutions to meet this accelerating energy demand reliably and affordably,” he said in a news release. “My new Strategic Energy Growth Task Force will take an all-of-the-above approach to meet the electricity demands of our growing economy in the short-run, and plan for Indiana to become an energy export state and national leader in nuclear energy for the long-run.”
Braun said that’ll be done “all with a focus on reliability and affordability for Hoosiers.”
The “state energy growth” plan — which will include 5-year and 20-year outlooks — is supposed to focus on a range of priorities and objectives:

Maintaining the “all-of-the-above” take on energy sources and maintaining existing coal-powered plants.
Developing the energy sector to meet current and future power needs, and to make Indiana an energy-exporting state.
Fostering technological “collaboration and innovation” between the state and private sector. Braun hopes to go nuclear.
Ensuring energy is affordable and reliable.

Braun’s order gives the task force a to-do list.
It must engage utility companies and others to align their strategic plans toward meeting the state’s energy growth targets. And it has to work with grid operators to focus on grid connection, transmission, dispatchable energy sources and more.
It will also work with the Indiana Economic Development Corporation to identify prospective big industrial power users and build support for “strategic clean energy industrial hubs.” It’ll consider ways to “encourage” those big grid additions to help pay for new electricity generation and transmission.
The task force was directed to analyze what’s driven electricity prices higher over the last 20 years and “propose actionable recommendations.” Additionally, it must “streamline” agency permitting procedures — “while safeguarding the (state’s) abundant natural resources.”
An initial task force report is due to Braun by the end of the year, and a state energy growth plan is due May 29, 2026.
The group’s membership includes Energy and Natural Resources Secretary Suzanne Jaworowski, Commerce Secretary David Adams, Office of Energy Development Executive Director Jon Ford, Department of Environmental Management Commissioner Clint Woods, Department of Natural Resources Director Alan Morrison, Utility Regulatory Commission Chair Jim Huston, Finance Authority Public Finance Director Dan Huge, or their representatives. Other executive branch experts may join.
The order also invited participation from legislative branch utility leaders, grid and transmission representatives, and other industry stakeholders.

(Photo Scott Eisen/Getty Images)As the cost of living crisis continues to plague Americans all over the country, residents and businesses alike are facing energy affordability challenges in Maine. A report from December found that roughly 100,000 Maine households struggle to pay energy bills. Maine residents deserve energy solutions that will drive costs down. Unless our leaders take action, it doesn’t seem like the threat of higher and higher energy prices is changing anytime soon. 
Older consumers are particularly vulnerable to the burden of high utility bills. Too often, seniors are forced to choose between energy expenditures and other necessities, putting their health and comfort at risk. We tend to rely more on assistance programs, spend more money on energy, and have a limited ability to reduce our home electricity bills.
This is a critical moment to tackle our energy cost, reliability, and demand challenges. Costs are climbing, and a recent analysis shows that Maine’s electricity prices grew at the third fastest rate in the country from 2014-2024. Electric bills are expected to reach a 12 year high, with customers across the state likely to see a 20% increase in their electricity bill during summer months.
Not only are consumers strained by high costs due to the lack of diverse energy sources, but our national security is also at stake. Relying on imported, expensive fuel exposes the United States to volatile energy markets overseas and gives our adversaries a leg up. Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont together spend $8.2 billion annually on imported energy. What Mainers need are sources that strengthen our grid resiliency and add more American energy to the mix.
The answer lies right in front of us: we can lower electricity costs for seniors and protect our national security by diversifying our energy sources. Here in New England, offshore wind is a powerful domestic energy solution that is already transforming local economies with good-paying jobs for workers and great opportunities for small businesses. Reliability-enhancing energy projects in Maine, including wind, solar, and geothermal, are made possible by federal investments that are now threatened by Congress’ budget bill, which currently phases out tax credits for wind and solar projects.
Alarmingly, these attacks on clean energy will only serve to make energy costs worse. Without federal tax incentives, Mainers could see a 16.7% increase in monthly energy prices by 2040. What’s more — the Trump administration has cut funding for and wants to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a lifesaving program that helps  households reduce their heating and cooling costs. In Maine, the 2023-24 program provided $19.06 million in benefits to more than 35,000 homes. 
As a senior and retired U.S. Army veteran, I know all about the impact of rising energy costs and understand the formidable connection between our energy security and national security. The budget bill — one that cuts Medicaid, food assistance, and tax credits — is now facing a vote in the U.S. Senate. I’m counting on my members of Congress to step up for Maine’s seniors and our energy future. Senator Collins knows about the energy crisis facing Mainers. I thank her for acting to preserve LIHEAP to help low-income Mainers pay their bills. Now is the opportunity for her to once again step up by protecting energy credits. By restoring federal energy tax credits, she can ensure Mainers, especially our elders, aren’t subject to price hikes and a less reliable grid.

,Source New Mexico,2025-06-25 16:29:05+00:00,Source New Mexico,More states are tracking rape kits. But key support for survivors may be slipping away.,"Amanda Hernández, Stateline",,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/06/25/more-states-are-tracking-rape-kits-but-key-support-for-survivors-may-be-slipping-away/,"A growing number of states are adopting systems to track rape kits, but the backlog, including in New Mexico, keeps growing.","After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
Prosecutors warn New Mexico lawmakers about ‘new backlog’ in rape kits

That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
Uber, Lyft oppose some bills that aim to prevent assaults during rides

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.












We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault. 


–  Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University




But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
Thousands are suing states over sexual abuse in juvenile detention facilities

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sexual assault survivors can now track their rape kits in most states

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

For months, billions of dollars from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, or NEVI, has been frozen as the Trump administration assesses guidelines established under former President Joe Biden.
U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin’s preliminary injunction Tuesday reopens the funding in Washington and 13 other states that sued the administration. 
Washington was set to get $71 million from the program, which Congress included in the bipartisan infrastructure law Biden signed in 2021.
Minnesota, Vermont and the District of Columbia were not covered under Lin’s ruling Tuesday, despite being involved in the lawsuit, because they didn’t provide enough evidence of how the funding freeze impacted them.
The judge’s decision won’t go into effect until July 1, to allow the U.S. Department of Justice time to appeal. The case would next go to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Lin, a Biden appointee, found the Trump administration had “overstepped their Constitutional and statutory authority” and had “attempted to override the express will of Congress.”
“When the Executive Branch treads upon the will of the Legislative Branch, and when an administrative agency acts contrary to law, it is the Court’s responsibility to remediate the situation and restore the balance of power,” Lin wrote.
The decision comes a week after attorneys for the states and the Justice Department argued the case in a Seattle courtroom. Pending appeals, the injunction will remain in effect while the court case proceeds. 
“Congress invested in forward-looking, clean electric vehicle infrastructure – exactly the future that Washington wants,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. “The court confirmed that Donald Trump can’t just wish that future away because he likes fossil fuels.”
Spokespeople from the White House and Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Overall, the plaintiff states were in line for about $1 billion to improve the nation’s fledgling electric vehicle charging network. The overall program involves about $5 billion.
The Federal Highway Administration had previously approved states’ plans for using the money, which was divvied up based on a formula that guides the distribution of federal highway funding. 
But in February, the agency rescinded approval of all those plans. In a notice to states, federal officials said they would “review the policies underlying the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program.” Until that review is over, the funding would be withheld. 
The Trump administration maintains it will still disburse funding eventually.
Washington’s Department of Transportation was accepting grant applications for pieces of its $71 million pie early this year, but hadn’t awarded any of it. Other states had spent some of their portions.
The preliminary injunction also blocks the administration from revoking approval of state funding plans.
The money was meant to help address the lack of chargers, which has stopped many drivers from transitioning to electric vehicles. To exemplify this issue, Lin opens her written ruling with a reference to a 1995 episode of “The Simpsons.”

“Some 26 years later, Congress sought to address the phenomenon that has come to be known as ‘range anxiety’: the unease experienced by electric vehicle (‘EV’) drivers when they are unsure where the next charging station might be, and whether their car’s battery has sufficient charge to get them there,” she continues.
While Washington has been ahead of other states in EV adoption, its construction of public charging infrastructure has lagged.

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia is due to appear in a downtown Nashville courtroom Wednesday for a hearing scheduled to set conditions for his release pending trial on human smuggling charges.
Federal prosecutors, however, continue to fight for him to be detained. On Sunday a federal magistrate judge issued an order dismissing claims that Abrego posed a flight risk or danger to the community. Prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to challenge the order.
Should he be released on bond, Abrego will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and could be deported, prosecutors said.
If Abrego is deported, the United States would “lose the meaningful opportunity to try its case. This would be irreparable harm to the public,” they argued in legal filings submitted Tuesday.
Prosecutors are seeking a temporary 30-day pause on proceedings to litigate their legal claims that Abrego be detained pending trial.
Family members of Abrego Garcia are also expected to make an appearance in Nashville, joining community leaders “to address concerns over due process, advocate for vulnerable communities and demand justice for Kilmar Abrego Garcia” a news release by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition said.
Abrego, an Salvadoran national living in Maryland, has served as a symbol of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
A father of three and a union metal sheet apprentice with no criminal history, Abrego was sent to a Salvadoran prison in March, despite a 2019 order that allowed him to reside in the country while his immigration case was considered. The 2019 immigration order specifically barred his deportation to El Salvador, where, Abrego said, he feared gang violence.
A federal prosecutor in Maryland conceded he had been deported in error during a hearing about Abrego’s deportation. On Tuesday, the New York Times was among the news organizations that reported the prosecutor, Erez Reuveni, filed a whistleblower complaint that alleged he was questioned by his bosses over why he had not also argued instead that Abrego was a terrorist, despite a lack of evidence. Reuveni was then placed on administrative leave when he refused to sign onto a legal brief making the same claims against Abrego. Reuveni was subsequently fired.
The Supreme Court in April ordered federal officials to facilitate Abrego’s return. It wasn’t until June 6 that he was flown to Nashville to face criminal human charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Prosecutors now allege the 2022 Tennessee traffic stop was part of a national smuggling scheme in which Abrego was paid to drive immigrants illegally in the country from Texas to other states.
An agent with the Department of Homeland Security testified he began his investigation into the three-year-old traffic stop in April, while Abrego remained in the El Salvador CECOT prison and after the Supreme Court had ordered the government to facilitate his return to the United States.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
In her order denying the prosecutors’ motion to detain Abrego, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes expressed skepticism for some of the government’s claims.
Federal prosecutors argued that a teen boy was present with a number of Hispanic men when Abrego was pulled over for speeding in Tennessee in 2022. The presence of a minor during a crime can be legal grounds for keeping an individual detained pending trial. They also argued that Abrego was a gang member who could intimidate potential witnesses. Abrego has not been charged with crimes related to minors or gang activity.
Holmes questioned the reliability of witnesses and evidence prosecutors cited, noting that some of the individuals made deals for their own criminal and immigration cases in exchange for their testimony. She also concluded that some of the government’s claims relied on “multiple layers of hearsay.”

Wes Climer, R-Rock Hill, attorney Dick Harpootlian and Rock Hill resident Carol Herring talk about legislative pay raises, which the state Supreme Court paused, outside Harpootlian's Columbia office on Monday, June 9, 2025. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — An $18,000 annual pay increase for legislators will go on pause while the state Supreme Court decides whether its approval was constitutional, the high court ordered Wednesday.
The state budget that takes effect Tuesday includes a $1,500 per-month raise in legislators’ “in-district compensation,” which is ostensibly to help cover expenses for constituent work back home, though it can be used for anything.
Sen. Wes Climer, along with a retired teacher in Rock Hill, challenged the increase June 9, arguing that the raises are unconstitutional because of a provision that bans legislators from raising their own per diems.
Under the schedule the state’s highest court set Wednesday, it could be months before the pay increase — if justices ultimately uphold it — hits legislators’ bank accounts.
Senator sues over his own raise, arguing it violates SC constitution

Climer’s attorney, former senator and Columbia attorney Dick Harpootlian, must file his arguments next month. The House, Senate and treasurer’s office, the case’s defendants, will have until mid-August to reply. The deadline for the final filing will be Sept. 4.
The raise was set to first hit 126 legislators’ bank accounts July 16, the first pay date of the new fiscal year.
Of the Legislature’s 170 members, 44 Republicans have opted out of the raise, according to clerks of the House and Senate.
In deciding to suspend the raises, the court said Climer, a Rock Hill Republican, had shown that letting them start amid the challenge would cause “immediate, irreparable harm” and that the case is sufficiently likely to succeed, according to the order signed by all five justices.
That doesn’t necessarily mean it will succeed — rather, there’s sufficient merit that it could.
“This is why the constitutional separation of powers is so important,” Harpootlian said in a statement Wednesday. “An independent judiciary stands ready to restrain the excessive impulses of the legislative branch.”
Thousands of taxpayer dollars could have gone to legislators before the court made its final decision, and that money would be difficult to recoup, especially if legislators spent it before a ruling, Harpootlian told reporters earlier this month.
Whether the raise from $1,000 to $2,500 a month qualifies as a per diem is the question at hand.
Harpootlian has argued the “per diem” referenced in the state constitution is a reference to any payment legislators receive for their position. The 1890 constitution pre-dated annual salaries and other compensation, Harpootlian told reporters.
But in the decades since, legislators’ pay comes in several main forms: a $10,400 annual salary, unchanged since 1990; the $1,000 for in-district expenses, unchanged since 1995; and a per diem for each day they’re in session, which is meant to cover meals and lodging.
Tied to local hotel rates, the subsistence can change annually. It’s currently $240 daily. It’s the same rate for every legislator, no matter where they live, and can be spent on anything.
Unlike those daily per diems, the in-district compensation should be reported on legislators’ income taxes as personal income, according to the state comptroller’s office.
Attorneys for the Senate argue it qualifies as a reimbursement, even though legislators don’t have to report how they spend the money, so the constitution’s rule that legislators can’t raise their own per diems doesn’t apply.
The Senate’s filing also contends the raises don’t cost taxpayers extra, since the money is set to come from money already designated for the chambers’ operational expenses.
Legislators who proposed the raise said it needed because costs have risen dramatically in the 30 years since the in-district compensation was set at $1,000.
The increase would also mean a boost in many legislators’ pensions, according to the Public Employee Benefit Authority, which oversees the state pension system.
The 43 legislators who were first elected before 2012 won’t see any difference, since the budget clause that established the raise didn’t define it as “earnable compensation,” which is what affects the formula under the former pension system, according to PEBA.
Other legislators, however, could see an increase in their pension.
The 2012 law that made changes to the pension system to rein in the state’s escalating liability ended the separate retirement system for legislators. Starting with the November 2012 elections, legislators could either join the state’s main pension system for public employees, join the optional 401K program, or decline to participate entirely.
It’s unclear how many legislators are in the main South Carolina Retirement System. But for those who are, their retirement benefits are based on a formula involving their highest years of compensation as a public employee. And the raise is considered compensation for pension purposes.

That’s the basis on which 20 Democratic attorneys general and one state governor are contesting sweeping cuts to federal grants and aid in a new lawsuit against the Trump administration.
The 80-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday, centers on how the Trump administration has interpreted a five-word section of federal regulations to rationalize a “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign,” abruptly terminating billions in already awarded funding to state and local governments, research institutions, universities, and more.
The full, 2020 rule promoted by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget states that federal agencies can cut off grants “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” OMB made clear that federal agencies can only terminate grants when there is evidence that the money is not achieving its intended goals or that there is cause to “significantly question” feasibility of achieving the goal.
But the Trump’s administration in a Feb. 26 executive order selectively picked five words from the regulation “no longer effectuates…agency priorities” — to justify abrupt cuts to federal aid.
“In effectuating this directive, Agency Defendants now assert — for the first time — that the Clause means something completely new: That the Clause permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind,” the lawsuit states.
Since the initial order authorizing the Department of Government Efficiency to get involved in federal agency grant distributions, the same phrase has featured prominently in subsequent orders, agency memos and explanations for slashing billions of dollars in aid to a wide host of recipients across the country.
The defendants include:

U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick
U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth
U.S. Secretary ofHomeland Security Kristi Noem
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi
U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin
Acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Director David Richardson
Acting National Endowment for Humanities Chairman Michael McDonald
Acting National Science Foundation Director Brian Stone

‘Unlawful actions’

“It’s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,” Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha said in a statement.
“Nearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called ‘agency priorities clause.’ Here, we are proactively asking the Courts to put a stop to the nonsense. The President cannot withhold Congressionally-allocated federal funds from the states, and this clause is no loophole.”
The complaint, which names a dozen federal agency heads as defendants, offers a litany of examples of the consequences of abrupt cuts to already awarded federal grants and aid: losing habitat restoration in Maine, ending efforts to combat hate crimes in New Jersey, ceasing shelter programs for migrants in Illinois released from overcrowded federal detention centers, and cutting off research of air quality risks from wildfire smoke in rural Nevada.
“With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived States of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more,” the lawsuit states.
No ‘unfettered power’
Even federal aid still flowing remains at risk, compromising safety and support to people who qualify for food assistance programs and those who live in flood zones, farmers, minority students, scientists, and more, the lawsuit states.
Arguing that the federal administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procuredures Act, the AGs have asked a federal judge to permanently clarify that federal regulations do not grant federal agencies “unfettered power” to terminate funding already awarded. Or, as an alternative, they have asked a judge to toss the Trump administration’s interpretation of the clause in question. The request, if granted, would apply to all existing and future federal grants.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the federal agencies, declined to comment on the lawsuit in an email Tuesday.
In addition to Neronha, the other AGs who filed the complaint represent Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is also representing his state in the case.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a 16-state coalition filing an amicus brief Tuesday supporting the Trump administration’s efforts to cut some funding for Harvard University over reported claims of antisemitism on campus.
Bird, alongside 15 other attorneys general, filed the brief Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by Harvard University challenging the move to strip billions in federal funding from the institution. In April, President Donald Trump’s administration paused $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $50 million in multi-year contracts for Harvard.
While the funding cut follows reports of instances of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment on campus, the decision came after the administration demanded Harvard end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, cooperate with immigration authorities and adopt merit-based admission standards or risk losing $9 billion in research funding — demands rejected by the university.
The federal lawsuit claims the federal government’s decision to slash funding for the university is being used as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard,” and argues the research funding being impacted by the cuts is unrelated to concerns about antisemitism. Attorneys for the university have also stated the funding cut is a violation of the First Amendment, as the government’s demands include potential restrictions on material that can be taught by Harvard faculty.
But in the amicus brief filed Tuesday, Bird and the other attorneys general said the claim that the Trump administration is violating the First Amendment is invalid. The filing points to a previous federal decision to strip tax-exempt status from Bob Jones University, affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983, because the institution was in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws by excluding Black applicants as students unless they were married.
The brief cites the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Bias report filed in April by Harvard University as evidence that there were repeated instances of antisemitism and an “alienating and hostile atmosphere” experienced by Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas against Israel.
“Harvard has failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students on its campus since at least October 7, 2023,” the brief states. “… Harvard invokes the First Amendment to distract from its failure to protect Jewish students in violation of Title IV, which the federal government cited as its reason for freezing funding. But the bottom line is that the First Amendment does not allow institutions to violate Title VI. Universities that accept federal funding must live up to their obligations to protect Jewish students, just like they protect students of other nationalities, ethnicities, and religions.”
Bird was joined in the brief by the attorneys general for Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.
In a news release, Bird said she and the other state officials “stand firmly with the Trump Administration and against antisemitism,” adding, “but Harvard does not.”
“When President Trump acted to fix the rampant antisemitism on Harvard’s campus by restricting federal funding, Harvard sued,” Bird said in a statement. “Harvard itself admits that antisemitism both exists and is a problem on its campus but is unwilling to address the issue. Jewish students deserve equal protection and access to education which is why I led a 16-state coalition to support President Trump’s actions.”

The grants were awarded early, in January instead of June, to allow organizations to begin work sooner in the year, officials said. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)In the wake of the resignation of the executive director of the Nebraska Environmental Trust and a search for a successor, the Friends of the Nebraska Environmental Trust highlighted issues the next director should pursue after being appointed.
This group of Trust supporters includes individuals with a long history of involvement with the Trust: former Trust board members, legislators, architects of the 1992 legislation creating the Trust; and backers of the constitutional amendment that created the Nebraska Lottery, the funding source of the Trust.
The Trust has awarded funding to more than 2,400 projects totaling approximately $350 million that have touched all 93 Nebraska counties since the 1990s. We are proud of the Trust’s successes and care deeply about its future. It has performed admirably but has some issues to resolve.
Part of the Nebraska Constitution
Forty-four and one-half percent of the proceeds of the Nebraska Lottery after the payment of prizes and operating expenses and after a $500,000 transfer to the Compulsive Gamblers Assistance Fund are allocated in Nebraska’s Constitution (III-24) to the Nebraska Environmental Trust Fund. The money must be used as provided in the Nebraska Environmental Trust Act.
Testimony introducing the legislation was clear. The Trust was created to provide incentives for local and regional groups across the state to recognize area needs, build partnerships and leverage funds to use the Trust to address important issues the state government lacks the capacity to meet or fund.
The Trust has been effective at engaging local groups in solving local problems and raising local money to match. In keeping with the original legislative intent, funds from the Trust should only be awarded to projects originated by a local or regional group or other organizations that have a record of promoting environmental quality in Nebraska.
Eligibility questions
State agencies may be awarded grants, but the projects should be ineligible unless they result in significant matched funds from the federal government or private sources. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and the Nebraska Department of Energy and Environment have both successfully employed that strategy in the past and brought important federal dollars to Nebraska.
Importantly, all projects should be reviewed by the Trust board’s grants committee and awarded on a competitive basis through an established ranking process. The current process of transferring money to state agencies that receive dollars from the general fund to supplement their budgets defeats the purpose of the Trust and creates ill-will with some in the public who see this as unfair competition.
The past two years have seen a decline in the number of grant applications and grants awarded. Consider the number of grant applicants in 2024 was 80 with 50 being funded; 2023 had 81 applications with only 47 deemed eligible for scoring but only 23 were funded by the Trust board. Both years showed drops in applications compared with 2022, which had 118 applications, 82 deemed eligible and 71 projects funded.
Funding available
Proceeds of approximately $20 million a year from the lottery are sufficient to fund more applications if the projects are held to evaluation standards. It has been past practice to fund as many qualified proposals as available dollars would allow.
Some organizations that previously submitted grant applications have not competed in recent years due to vague changes to the criteria for grants, erratic scoring of grant applications and overly bureaucratic administration of the grants.
Concerns expressed by Friends of the Trust when the Trust rewrote its rules and regulations have been shown to be valid. Some of the criteria are difficult to understand and even harder to follow. Requirements mandated by the Trust board sometimes exceed federal requirements for similar grants, which has no justification in state law.
Scoring questions
The scoring of grant applications seems to occur in a black box. What was once a public process is now an opaque one. In the past, scoring could be analyzed for inconsistencies. Public review is no longer possible, and confidence in project scoring has been lost.
Grant applicants have complained of mixed messages and finding the goal posts moved after grants are awarded. Applicants have spent money expecting reimbursement under grant contracts and found reimbursement denied because of new interpretations. Applicants fear retribution if they discuss concerns about the process.
The current rules and regulations do not provide enough guidance for them to comply with Trust criteria or protect them from arbitrary decisions.
Nebraskans understand and support accountability and effectiveness. Those are legitimate goals, and changes to reach those goals must be made periodically. But reality also must be recognized.
Seek more applications
A maximum number of quality grant applications should be sought from private organizations and non-state agencies by continuing and expanding training sessions for potential applicants. And communication is key.
The Trust must reopen its processes to public scrutiny to promote confidence in its operations. Public disclosure would help — of the availability of funds, the criteria for applying and being successful and clarity and consistency about eligibility.
Long-time Trust supporters believe public confidence can be restored and more applications encouraged with proper leadership by the executive director and the board. This can be done by recognizing the commitment to the history and purpose of the Trust to “conserve, enhance and restore” the natural environments of Nebraska.
Rebuild trust
The governor, the Nebraska Legislature, the new executive director and the Trust board should want to ensure Trust funds are used in accordance with the intent expressed in Section 81–15.168 of state law: “The Trust shall complement existing governmental and private efforts by encouraging and leveraging the use of private resources on environmental needs with the greatest potential impact on future environmental quality in Nebraska. The Trust shall develop a long-range environmental focus … and shall join public and private efforts in achieving the collective environmental goals of Nebraska’s citizens.”
Nowhere does the law or its design indicate that funds should be removed from the Trust to help balance the state’s general fund budget.

Kennedy Jr. (File photo by Hadley Barndollar/New Hampshire Bulletin)Scott Brown, a former U.S. senator for Massachusetts and ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa during the first Trump administration, announced Wednesday he is running for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire.
Brown, a Republican, joins an early race to replace Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who announced in March that she would retire at the end of her term. U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, a Democrat, entered the race in April. No other Republicans have announced campaigns thus far.
“We need people in the United States Senate who can get the job done,” Brown said in his announcement video. “And I have a proven record of doing just that.”
Brown was one of the most common names floated by spectators as a potential candidate, and his path to the Republican nomination grew clearer after former Gov. Chris Sununu publicly ruled out a run.
Brown targeted Pappas Wednesday, saying in the video, “For four years, Chris Pappas has stood with Joe Biden as he opened the border, drove up the cost of everything, and made life just simply unaffordable.”
“Chris Pappas wants a better title,” he continued. “I want a better America.”
Pappas, who has represented New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District since 2018, responded to Brown’s announcement with a statement: “I got into this race because Granite Staters made it clear they want a Senator grounded in their values. … While Scott Brown looks for yet another opportunity to do Wall Street’s bidding and blindly support President Trump and his agenda, I’ll always put New Hampshire first.”
Brown was born at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, and moved to Massachusetts in his youth before starting a career in the state legislature there. In 2010, he won a special election to replace U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy and represent Massachusetts. He was defeated by Elizabeth Warren in his 2012 re-election bid and subsequently moved back to New Hampshire, where he ran for this same U.S. Senate seat in 2014. He won the GOP nomination but lost that election to Shaheen.
Brown praised President Donald Trump in his announcement and signaled his allegiance to the president.
“President Trump is fighting every day to right the ship,” he said. “He sealed the border. He stood up to China. And he restored our standing in the world.”
In his Massachusetts political career, Brown was known for his work on veterans’ issues and was ranked “the most popular officeholder in Massachusetts” in a Boston Globe poll. He once described himself as a “pro-choice moderate Republican,” according to Real Clear Politics. GovTrack named him the third most moderate Republican in the U.S. Senate in 2013.
“Scott Brown is right that Democrats like Chris Pappas are out-of-touch with Granite Staters,” Nick Puglia, regional press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement to the Bulletin. “New Hampshire is in play for Republicans in 2026, and we play to win.”

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia is due to appear in a downtown Nashville courtroom today for a hearing scheduled to set conditions for his release pending trial on human smuggling charges.
Federal prosecutors, however, continue to fight for him to be detained. On Sunday a federal magistrate judge issued an order dismissing claims that Abrego posed a flight risk or danger to the community. Prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to challenge the order.
Should he be released on bond, Abrego will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and could be deported, prosecutors said.
If Abrego is deported, the United States would “lose the meaningful opportunity to try its case. This would be irreparable harm to the public,” they argued in legal filings submitted Tuesday.
Prosecutors are seeking a temporary 30-day pause on proceedings to litigate their legal claims that Abrego be detained pending trial.
Family members of Abrego Garcia are also expected to make an appearance in Nashville, joining community leaders “to address concerns over due process, advocate for vulnerable communities and demand justice for Kilmar Abrego Garcia” a news release by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition said.
Abrego, an Salvadoran national living in Maryland, has served as a symbol of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
A father of three and a union metal sheet apprentice with no criminal history, Abrego was sent to a Salvadoran prison in March, despite a 2019 order that allowed him to reside in the country while his immigration case was considered. The 2019 immigration order specifically barred his deportation to El Salvador, where, Abrego said, he feared gang violence.
A federal prosecutor in Maryland conceded he had been deported in error during a hearing about Abrego’s deportation. On Tuesday, The New York Times was among the news organizations that reported the prosecutor, Erez Reuveni, filed a whistleblower complaint that alleged he was questioned by his bosses over why he had not also argued instead that Abrego was a terrorist, despite a lack of evidence. Reuveni was then placed on administrative leave when he refused to sign a legal brief making the same claims against Abrego. Reuveni was subsequently fired.
The Supreme Court in April ordered federal officials to facilitate Abrego’s return. It wasn’t until June 6 that he was flown to Nashville to face criminal human charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Traffic stop
Prosecutors now allege the 2022 Tennessee traffic stop was part of a national smuggling scheme in which Abrego was paid to drive immigrants illegally in the country from Texas to other states.
An agent with the Department of Homeland Security testified he began his investigation into the three-year-old traffic stop in April, while Abrego remained in the El Salvador CECOT prison and after the Supreme Court had ordered the government to facilitate his return to the United States.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
In her order denying the prosecutors’ motion to detain Abrego, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes expressed skepticism for some of the government’s claims.
Federal prosecutors argued that a teen boy was present with a number of Hispanic men when Abrego was pulled over for speeding in Tennessee in 2022. The presence of a minor during a crime can be legal grounds for keeping an individual detained pending trial. They also argued that Abrego was a gang member who could intimidate potential witnesses. Abrego has not been charged with crimes related to minors or gang activity.
Holmes questioned the reliability of witnesses and evidence prosecutors cited, noting that some of the individuals made deals for their own criminal and immigration cases in exchange for their testimony. She also concluded that some of the government’s claims relied on “multiple layers of hearsay.”

,Kansas Reflector,2025-06-25 15:41:39+00:00,Kansas Reflector,Kansas companies share anxiety about potential cuts to federal renewable energy tax incentives,"Tim Carpenter, Morgan Chilson",,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/06/25/kansas-companies-share-anxiety-about-potential-cuts-to-federal-renewable-energy-tax-incentives/,Kansas companies involved in renewable energy development share concern about Congress diminishing or eliminating federal energy tax credits and incentives.,"Sarah Hill-Nelson, CEO of Bowersock Mills & Power Co. in Lawrence, says alternative energy tax credits targeted for elimination by Congress offered important financial support for expansion of electricity production capacity at the hydroelectric facility positioned on both the north and south sides of the Kansas River. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Owners of the Bowersock Mills & Power Co. relied on federal renewable energy tax incentives to expand production at the Lawrence hydroelectric plant that’s been drawing power from the Kansas River for more than a century.
Sarah Hill-Nelson, CEO of the facility, said tax benefits designed to encourage growth of alternative energy production projects — now threatened by Congress — were essential to upgrading one of the oldest hydroelectric plants west of the Mississippi River nearly 15 years ago.
“We issued $25 million in debt to expand,” she said. “We were able to triple the amount of energy we produce on an annual basis. Do we have aspirations to expand? Absolutely.”
Hill-Nelson said incentives that made a difference at Bowersock were comparable to investment and production tax policies targeted in U.S. House and U.S. Senate legislation drafted by Republicans to conform with President Donald Trump’s political agenda. In May, the House passed its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on a vote of 215-214. The Senate is preparing to vote on its bill.
Both would undermine U.S. alternative energy companies, threaten jobs and make it difficult to meet growing domestic demand for electricity, Hill-Nelson said.
Her opinion stood in contrast to Trump’s recent post to social media: “None of it (green energy) works without massive government subsidy.”
She said the president didn’t have a clear understanding or was misled about the extent to which U.S. fossil fuel companies benefitted from federal energy incentives, including tax breaks, lease and royalty agreements or funding of research. The International Monetary Fund reported fossil fuel subsidies in the United States reached $757 billion in 2022.
 
The hit on Kansas
Hill-Nelson took part in a media briefing Tuesday hosted by the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and its subsidiary, the Clean Energy Business Network, to highlight how the House-passed budget bill would raise household energy spending in Kansas by an average of $210 per year in 2030 and by $670 per year in 2035.
The industry associations said the House budget bill supported by Kansas’ U.S. Reps. Derek Schmidt, Ron Estes and Tracey Mann, would result in loss of an estimated 9,700 jobs in Kansas within five years and nearly 10,000 jobs in a decade. The package would shrink annual gross domestic product in Kansas by $1.9 billion by 2035, the associations said.
“Companies rely on long-term business certainty in the tax code to plan projects and allocate capital,” said Lisa Jacobson, president of Business Council for Sustainable Energy in Washington, D.C. “As we face an era of unprecedented energy demand growth, now is not the time to disrupt the market by making unnecessary changes to the tax structure.”
Lynn Abramson, president of Clean Energy Business Network, said deliberations in Congress about withdrawal of tax credits for alternative energy development had already damaged small businesses nationwide.
Businesses in Kansas and elsewhere built on federal laws making energy tax credits available into the 2030s should be given a smooth transition away from those incentives, she said.
 
Shift in current
Mark Horst, owner of the residential and commercial solar installer King Solar in Hutchinson, said Congress appeared willing to quickly phase out a 30% tax credit for residential rooftop solar projects. If the plug were pulled on the tax credit at the end of 2025, he said, the change would break consistent growth his company had experienced over the past 20 years.
“We would probably have to cut at least 60% of our workforce in about a year,” Horst said.
Residential customers were certain to change buying decisions if the tax credit for installing solar on their homes goes away, said Malcolm Proudfit, CEO of Good Energy Solutions of Lawrence. 
The majority of Good Energy’s customers were contemplating deployment of solar from a cost-savings perspective, he said. 
“The tax credit plays a key role in either reducing their overall net cost for the system if they’re paying for it outright or for those that finance their systems,” he said. “Then you apply the tax credit to your personal taxes for the year and that ought to get some kind of a return or tax refund.”
In the Senate proposal, the tax credit for solar panels on rooftops would end 180 days after the bill passed, Proudfit said. 
 
Details matter
Justin Grady, utilities director for the Kansas Corporation Commission, said elimination or change to federal clean energy tax credits could affect the Kansas Sky solar facility proposed by Evergy that would be located in Douglas County.
Evergy’s solar complex would have the potential to meet criteria for the full tax credit, Grady said, noting that Evergy had contracts lined up and fixed-price agreements for buying solar panels.
“But if those tax credits go away, it will obviously meaningfully affect the price of the power purchase agreements that utilities might otherwise take advantage of for any renewable energy facility that utilities in Kansas decide to build,” he said.
He said the Senate bill, which is still under development, allowed projects beginning construction in 2025 to receive 100% of a federal tax credit, but projects launching in 2026 would receive 60%. It’s unclear what “beginning construction” means, he said, as it could define the simple movement of dirt or incurring no more than 5% of qualified costs.
Joseph Astrab, consumer counsel for the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, which advocates for residential and small business ratepayers before the KCC and Legislature, said utilities must determine the best way to meet energy needs in the context of affordability and reliability.
He said cuts to federal incentives transforming the energy-generation mix, such as whether electricity was supplied by natural gas, wind or solar, would force utilities to overhaul those plans.
“It’s always been thought, well, solar and other renewable resources will have this tax credit available at all times, so it’s been built into the analyses,” Astrab said. “So, if there’s a shift where a lot of that goes away for new projects, then that may impact how the utilities review that and what they bring to the commission.”
 
Business slowdown
Laura Thompson, president of Overland Park-based FlowEnergy, said discussion in Washington about phasing out energy tax credits led to a slowdown in the company’s business of supplying schools, universities and commercial property owners with hardware and software to better manage energy usage.
She said tax credits were an important opportunity for property owners to speed the payback from energy-saving investments.
“Right now,” she said, “the projects in our pipeline are on hold or have significantly slowed. This isn’t good because our projects not only provide jobs for our own technical and services staff, but also for the construction and engineering firms that we’re subcontracted to to execute these projects.”
Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the nonpartisan Climate and Energy Project, offered a personal example of how loss of federal tax credits for adoption of energy efficient building methods meant.
She said her daughter needed a new roof on her home because of storms in the Kansas City area. If she installed an Energy Star roof, Barnett said, she could receive a $1,200 tax credit under existing federal law. The U.S. Senate bill would end that tax credit.
“We have spent the last three years really building up a pipeline and an opportunity to work with Kansans on energy efficiency upgrades and retrofits to help people affect their utilities. In a pen swoop, all of a sudden, we’re not getting our grant money for those programs,” Barnett said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bowersock-dam-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 12:14:17.284414

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota nonprofit focused on transgender rights will curate and maintain what’s been a volunteer-run, searchable database of businesses friendly to LGBTQ+ patrons.
The Transformation Project and the database, known as Dorothy’s List, announced the merger this week in a press release meant to dovetail with the end of Pride Month.
Adam Jorgensen founded Dorothy’s List in 2023, using a $1,000 grant from the Sutton Leadership Institute, a nonprofit that trains aspiring young professionals in business, nonprofit and political spheres. 
State apologizes, pays transgender advocacy group $300,000 for discrimination

Jorgensen applied for and received the grant from the institute after graduating from its yearlong development program. The Sioux Falls man pulled information from a few different – but largely dormant – regional lists of businesses to launch the statewide list.
Similar lists exist nationwide, such as The Pink Pages, and others focus on medical providers. Jorgensen’s goal was to offer a state-specific list for South Dakota.
The grant money allowed Jorgensen to pay for a logo design and produce stickers and other promotional merchandise, as well as to set up the website, which launched in 2023.
The site lists around 150 businesses, and Jorgensen told South Dakota Searchlight that about 80 of them have taken its inclusion pledge. That pledge asks businesses to take steps like placing rainbow flags in business windows, using provided materials for employee training and committing to speak against legislative proposals that might harm LGBTQ+ people.
With a full-time job and other commitments, Jorgensen said he’d grown concerned that he couldn’t offer enough attention to the project to properly maintain the list, named for Dorothy from “The Wizard of Oz.” It’s a nod to the question “are you a friend of Dorothy,” asked in decades past by people looking for safe spaces in the era of criminalized homosexuality.
Jorgensen said he was thrilled when the Transformation Project agreed to fold the curation of Dorothy’s List into its project list.
“It’s fantastic to see the Transformation Project take over as lead of this project,” Jorgensen said in the announcement. “Dorothy’s List addresses a real need for South Dakotans, LGBTQ+ and Two Spirit or otherwise, that want to spend their time and dollars wisely.”
“Two Spirit” is a word used by Indigenous people to refer to those who do not identify as male or female.
The Transformation Project’s status a nonprofit with a full-time staff should allow Dorothy’s List to “expand its reach,” the press release says, and to serve as a tool for “communities to unite over a common cause.”
“We must continue to hold the corporations and individuals accountable that actively harm our community by rallying behind those that don’t,” Susan Williams, executive director of the Transformation Project, said in the release.

Charlotte, Vermont


Kristine S. Gerson
1957 – 2025
Wife, Mother, Teacher, Friend

Kristine Sheathelm Gerson passed away peacefully in her home on June 23, 2025. Her death followed a long period of enduring a brutal lymphoma. She remains a beautiful young woman in the eyes of her loving family and wonderful friends.
Kristine was born in Colorado Springs, CO, on January 26, 1957. She spent her early years in Lansing, MI, alongside her brother Kurt before moving to Storrs, CT, during elementary school. Her father taught at the University of Connecticut, and her mother taught in the Mansfield Public Schools. It was in Storrs that she met and fell in love with her husband, Bill. She initially attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, but after deciding that teaching was her future, she transferred to Wheelock College in Boston, MA. After graduation, she and Bill married, and she moved to Baltimore, MD, to be with him during his medical school years. They lived at the Garrison Forrest School as dorm parents. Teaching was her professional passion. She taught first in Rockville, MD, where she taught both art and special education. She then taught in the Baltimore Public Schools in a self-contained special education classroom in south Baltimore until she had her first child, Zachary, and the new family moved to Boston. She spent six years in Boston while Bill was at the Children’s Hospital, and the family added two more sons, Jacob and Elijah, while also running a home daycare. The family moved to Charlotte, VT, in the summer of 1988 when Bill joined Pediatric Medicine in South Burlington. Their fourth son, Abraham, was born soon after the move. Kristine continued to provide home daycare in Charlotte, taught at the religious school at Temple Sinai in South Burlington, and gave back to her local community by founding, along with her friend Marty Ditchey, the Charlotte Food Shelf, for which she was later honored as Volunteer of the Year by the town.
Kristine went on to teach first and second grade at Charlotte Central School for twenty years until her illness and the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated her early retirement. She made true friends among her colleagues and wishes to thank them, especially Peggy Coutu, Kathy Lara, and Rookie Manning, for the love they showed her as her disease progressed. At Charlotte Central School, she treasured her work as the school union representative and was especially thankful for the love and support she received during her illness from her district union colleagues.

Kristine and Bill also want to express thanks for the excellent care, both compassionate and wise, provided by Dr. Paul Unger and Stephanie Pevear in Burlington, VT, and Dr Jeremy Abramson at MGH and to the nurses on Lunder 10 at MGH where she underwent two cellular transplants and multiple treatment protocols. She was excited about contributing to medical science and enjoyed meeting the dedicated research and care teams. The care Kristine received at end-of-life from UVM Home Health and Hospice was truly caring. Abby Foulk and her husband Mort Wasserman, longtime friends and colleagues, were essential supports as she navigated her last years.
While she excelled as a teacher, her family and community of friends defined her – the love, travel, and just the fun of it all. Married for almost 50 years, her loving family – husband, four sons, four daughters-in-law, and six grandchildren was a constant joy. They are all heartbroken by their loss. Her father, Herb, and his wife, Beverly, were extraordinary hosts to the entire family for weeks at a time for many decades at their homes in Maine and Arizona. Lifelong friends Jack and Sue Rome are special, and as they vacationed together as a family for forty years, they are indeed family. Alan Guttmacher enticed Bill and Kristine to move to Vermont after they had spent years together at Boston Children’s Hospital, and he and his wife, Bridgid, have also been a part of the family since. The now-retired partners at Pediatric Medicine are also family, and they loved and nurtured both Kristine and Bill. She was so thankful to have been a part of that family – Tom and Lorna Bates, Buzz and Donna Land, Delight and Jack Long, and Deb and Thom Hartswick. Kristine was also very grateful to the current partners and staff at Pediatric Medicine for their accommodations necessitated by her prolonged illness.
Kristine was an individual of great beauty, humor, strength, compassion, and a deep commitment to caring. She loved her series of family dogs: Pugs, Shumba and Nyabo, Mazel, and her last – Tootsie and Ollie. She was an avid knitter and reader, particularly as her illness became more limiting when she would produce treasure troves of knitting creations and read hundreds of books each year. She was dedicated to nature and will be missed by the wide variety of birds that daily visited her yard at home, bringing Kristine and whoever was visiting happiness at the most difficult of times. Her family and friends will profoundly feel her enduring legacy. Instead of flowers, her family asks that contributions be made in her name to the Charlotte Library and the National Audubon Society.
She is survived by her sons Zachary Gerson and his wife Kristin (Ducrest) and their three children, Eloise, Samuel, and Lilly of Wynnewood, PA; Jacob Gerson and his wife Maria Gabriela Morgade Yllera of Valladolid, Spain and their son Manuel Gerson Morgade; Elijah and his wife Sara Johnson-Cardona and their children Louis and Santiago, of St. Louis, MO; and Abraham Gerson and his wife Alicia (Lorre) of Avignon, France;  her parents, Herbert Sheathelm and his wife Beverly Kelton of Tucson, AZ, and her mother Shirlee Sheathelm of Newington, CT; her brother Kurt Sheathelm and his wife Marjie of Rocky Hill, CT; her brother-in-law Elliot Gerson and his wife Jessica Herzstein of Washington D.C. and Aspen, CO; and her sister-in-law Annie Swanson and her husband Russ of Sherman, CT; many nieces and nephews as well as close extended family – Ellen and John O’Shaughnessy of Ellington, CT and Steve and Beth Gerson of Hampton Bays, NY.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a 16-state coalition that includes North Dakota filing an amicus brief Tuesday supporting the Trump administration’s efforts to cut some funding for Harvard University over reported claims of antisemitism on campus.
Bird, alongside 15 other attorneys general, filed the brief Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by Harvard University challenging the move to strip billions in federal funding from the institution. In April, President Donald Trump’s administration paused $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $50 million in multi-year contracts for Harvard.
While the funding cut follows reports of instances of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment on campus, the decision came after the administration demanded Harvard end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, cooperate with immigration authorities and adopt merit-based admission standards or risk losing $9 billion in research funding — demands rejected by the university.
The federal lawsuit claims the federal government’s decision to slash funding for the university is being used as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard,” and argues the research funding being impacted by the cuts is unrelated to concerns about antisemitism. Attorneys for the university have also stated the funding cut is a violation of the First Amendment, as the government’s demands include potential restrictions on material that can be taught by Harvard faculty.
But in the amicus brief filed Tuesday, Bird and the other attorneys general said the claim that the Trump administration is violating the First Amendment is invalid. The filing points to a previous federal decision to strip tax-exempt status from Bob Jones University, affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983, because the institution was in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws by excluding Black applicants as students if they were in an interracial relationship or marriage beginning in 1975.
The brief cites the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Bias report filed in April by Harvard University as evidence that there were repeated instances of antisemitism and an “alienating and hostile atmosphere” experienced by Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas against Israel.
“Harvard has failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students on its campus since at least October 7, 2023,” the brief states. “… Harvard invokes the First Amendment to distract from its failure to protect Jewish students in violation of Title IV, which the federal government cited as its reason for freezing funding. But the bottom line is that the First Amendment does not allow institutions to violate Title VI. Universities that accept federal funding must live up to their obligations to protect Jewish students, just like they protect students of other nationalities, ethnicities, and religions.”
Bird was joined in the brief by the attorneys general for Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.
In a news release, Bird said she and the other state officials “stand firmly with the Trump Administration and against antisemitism,” adding, “but Harvard does not.”
“When President Trump acted to fix the rampant antisemitism on Harvard’s campus by restricting federal funding, Harvard sued,” Bird said in a statement. “Harvard itself admits that antisemitism both exists and is a problem on its campus but is unwilling to address the issue. Jewish students deserve equal protection and access to education which is why I led a 16-state coalition to support President Trump’s actions.”

I was healthy before my pregnancy, and things seemed to be going smoothly. Until they weren’t.
In my final weeks of pregnancy, I developed symptoms I now know were due to preeclampsia, a dangerous and potentially life-threatening condition. I kept going to the hospital, sure something wasn’t right. But without a diagnosis, I was sent home again and again. It wasn’t until I insisted on more testing that I was finally admitted and diagnosed. By then, my condition had worsened. I lost a lot of blood during delivery and needed a transfusion. In those first few days, when I should have been soaking up the time and bonding with my newborn, I was exhausted and overwhelmed.
I’m here, and Marleigh is here, because NC Medicaid, North Carolina’s Medicaid program, made it possible for me to keep seeking care. Without it, I might not have gone back to the hospital. Without it, I may have tried to wait things out at home instead of advocating for myself. Medicaid meant I didn’t have to choose between the hospital bill and getting help for myself and my baby. It meant I could focus on surviving and caring for my daughter.
Today, Marleigh is thriving. I cherish every milestone, from her first laugh to trying her first foods and the first time she crawled. I know there will be so many more firsts to come. But I also know how close we came to missing them.
That’s why it’s so alarming to see Congress rushing forward on deep and harmful cuts to Medicaid. Last month, the House passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which will slash funding for Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars. And now, the Senate is poised to pass the bill, after somehow making the proposed cuts even more extreme. Here in North Carolina, more than 260,000 people could lose coverage through NC Medicaid. This is almost half the number of people who gained access to care through the state’s recent expansion of the program.
These aren’t just numbers. They’re moms, babies, grandparents and neighbors. These are people like me who simply needed help during a critical moment.
The bill would also impose harmful new work requirements on adults receiving Medicaid, raise out-of-pocket costs, and make families prove and reprove their eligibility over and over again. But these changes don’t make anyone healthier. They just create a bureaucracy that will just mean that more babies, parents, godparents, and other caregivers won’t get the care they need to survive, much less thrive.
Earlier this year, I traveled to Capitol Hill with my daughter as part of ZERO TO THREE’s Strolling Thunder event to advocate for programs like Medicaid, SNAP and Early Head Start that help families like mine. I joined 50 other families from across the country to make our voices heard. We’re not asking for special treatment. We’re asking Congress to protect the basics.
Families should not have to fight this hard to survive childbirth, recover or care for a newborn. Families need a system that supports us, not one that forces us to choose between our health and groceries and a roof over our babies’ heads.
Congress must reject Medicaid cuts and invest in the programs that give families a strong foundation. We deserve a country where every baby has the chance to grow up healthy and every parent has the support they need to care for them.
Medicaid saved my life and gave Marleigh the chance to live hers. It’s time for Congress to protect that promise for every family.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-25 11:13:05.930114

Here’s how it works,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/25/nyc-mayor-race-ranked-choice-voting/,"NYC is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that takes some explaining. Here’s how it works.","NEW YORK (AP) — New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.
Progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani declared victory in Tuesday’s primary, after former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo conceded the race in a stunning upset. Also in the race were several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander.
[RELATED: CT begins exploring ranked-choice voting merits, logistics]
Mamdani took a commanding position just hours after the polls closed. Unofficial results from the New York City’s Board of Elections showed Mamdani was ranked on more ballots than Cuomo. Mamdani was listed as the second choice by tens of thousands of more voters than Cuomo.
Ranked choice voting is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren’t forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.
Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter’s top choice doesn’t have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.
[RELATED: Yale students lobby lawmakers for ranked-choice voting in CT]
The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.
How does it work?
In New York City’s version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.
If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters — more than 50% — that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.
If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.
Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place — the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people — is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people’s votes are then redistributed to their second choices.
That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters’ third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.
Eleven candidates were on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams wasn’t one of them. He’s a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.
How long will this take?
The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn’t start right away.
Polls closed at 9 p.m. Tuesday. The ranked choice tabulations, however, won’t start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.
The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won’t be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.
This was the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.
Why do people like ranked choice?
One benefit is that nobody “wastes” their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.
Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn’t stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.
Another benefit is that it’s tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it’s possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.
That’s theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.
What are the negatives?
The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.
Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.
Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.
That’s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.
There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25176069210999-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 11:13:05.930114

Muller, a former Topeka City Council member, criticized the council's decision to repeal and amend DEI policies. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)When Tiffany Muller saw the Topeka City Council roll back parts of the city’s antidiscrimination protections, she felt a familiar weight settle in.
In 2004, Muller became the city’s first openly gay council member and faced relentless harassment from the Westboro Baptist Church, the notorious anti-LGBTQ+ group based in Topeka. Muller cast the deciding vote when the council passed an antidiscrimination ordinance — a measure that had repeatedly fallen short by just one vote for years.
“It’s still one of the proudest moments of my life — to have led that effort in 2004 and gotten it passed,” Muller said. “So to see the council so cavalierly throw that away two decades later is really frustrating.”
Muller, now president of the national advocacy group End Citizens United, is among several LGBTQ+ leaders who criticized the council’s decision last week to repeal and amend portions of the city’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
They said the move not only undermines hard-fought civil rights protections but sends a discouraging message to the community at a time when state and federal safeguards remain uncertain.
The council’s 5-1 vote eliminated the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and repealed city code requiring affirmative action plans for contractors. It also stripped language that once required hiring goals, diversity training programs and compliance reporting related to protected classes.
While nondiscrimination language remains in parts of the code, critics said the removal of specific protections put LGBTQ+ residents at risk — especially since the U.S. Supreme Court has not explicitly affirmed protections for gender identity or sexual orientation under federal law.
Kansas Rep. Susan Ruiz — one of the two first openly LGBTQ+ legislators — called the decision a setback for a city that had once been a leader in local civil rights efforts.
“It hits you at your core because you might already be rejected by your community, maybe even by your family — and now you’re getting it from your city, you’re getting it from your state,” Ruiz said. “It’s a horrible feeling to know that your civil rights are always on the chopping block.”
Ruiz said the concern goes beyond symbolism.
“I worry about younger people,” she said. “Why would they want to live in our state? Why would they want to live in Topeka?”
The vote comes in response to executive orders issued by President Donald Trump regarding federal funding. As a result, grant recipients are now required to avoid programs related to affirmative action or DEI.
  Topeka city attorney Amanda Stanley, seen at the July 11, 2023, city council meeting, said the city could lose federal funding unless it repealed DEI ordinances. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Topeka city attorney Amanda Stanley told council members if they didn’t recertify Housing and Urban Development funds for shelter programs by June 30, they could lose funding as early as July 1.
Stanley did not respond to an inquiry seeking clarification about the timeline for the funds.
Several council members expressed frustration about the decision but pointed to the potential loss of at-risk program funding as a driving factor.
“One thing that I know for sure is that the governing body — or the city of Topeka — is not out here looking to discriminate against anyone,” said council member Marcus Miller. “(We are) making sure that our language is clear, but something susceptible to do what we need to do as a city.”
Some residents, however, disagreed with the council’s interpretation and urged them to find alternative solutions.
“There are other cities that are not simply taking the bait. They are not focusing on the money. They are looking at the right thing to do,” said Topeka resident Glenda Overstreet Vaughn. “We can’t afford to be pawns, manipulated by the federal government’s funding chess game.”
Melissa Stiehler, advocacy director for Loud Light, called the decision unnecessary and “deeply harmful.” She said the organization reached out to council members last month with alternative solutions that would maintain federal compliance while protecting local civil rights, but never received a response.
“They needlessly put LGBTQIA protections at risk with no explanation,” Stiehler said. “This vote was deeply harmful to the people of our community. We hope to work with them to bring back the local protections that were stripped away.”
Not all council members viewed the vote as final. Council member Spencer Duncan reminded residents that the code is a “living document” and said the council plans to revisit the ordinance at its July 8 meeting after hearing feedback from the community.
Both Ruiz and Muller said pursuing legal action against the federal grant restrictions would have sent a stronger message.
“We’ve seen other cities, states and institutions push back against these threats — and win in court,” Muller said. “So I don’t think repealing these critically important protections was their only option. The worst thing we can do is to just comply, because that doesn’t protect anyone — and it’s certainly not going to protect the Topeka community.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PA141022-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-25 11:13:05.930114

First Judicial District Prosecutor Todd Murray asked ASP in June 2024 to investigate Franklin. A Special Investigations Unit (SIU) probe revealed the Helena-West Helena mayor had not filed taxes four of the past five years. 
Franklin was charged with four counts of Failure to Pay or File a Tax Return, a Class D felony. The investigation is ongoing and more information will be released as it becomes available, the release states. 
In late May, Franklin refused to resign as mayor after the City Council voted 6-0 that he step down. The resolution was a response to a profanity-laden video call between the mayor, his adult daughter and his adult niece that went viral online.
Council member Maxine Miller introduced the resolution to censure Franklin and call for his resignation “for conduct unbecoming of the office of mayor during a recent Facebook Live broadcast,” The Helena World reported.
Franklin told council members he was not leaving, and abruptly adjourned the meeting after the resolution vote despite a lengthy agenda. The World reported at the time that petitions were being circulated in Helena-West Helena seeking a recall election to remove the mayor.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Senate voted unanimously on June 18 to resume the federal Secure Rural Schools program, which sent millions of dollars to small Alaska schools each year until Congress failed to reauthorize it in 2023. 
Congress passed the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act in 2000, which launched the program as a way to help logging towns cope with the loss of revenue caused by a slowdown in logging on nearby federal land.
In 2023, it directed more than $250 million to communities nationwide and over $12.6 million to Alaska towns. 
But in 2024, a reauthorization bill stalled in the House of Representatives, and the program ended. In the wake of that failure, some rural schools in Alaska, particularly in Southeast Alaska, have suffered significant budget cuts.
This spring, the Alaska Legislature voted by a 56-4 margin to approve a resolution that calls on Congress to renew the program.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, cosponsored a reauthorization bill, and the Senate approved it last week.
“If you’re a city manager building a budget or a school administrator looking at new hires, you need financial certainty. That’s why renewing the Secure Rural Schools program before funding lapses has been one of my top priorities in this Congress, and today was a crucial step in that process,” Murkowski said in a written statement. “I hope my colleagues in the House will quickly pass this legislation to provide stability for Alaska’s schools and local governments.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/uscapitoldarkskies-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 10:02:02.768263

That’s the basis on which 20 Democratic attorneys general, including Maine’s Aaron Frey, and one state governor, are contesting sweeping cuts to federal grants and aid in a new lawsuit against the Trump administration. The 80-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday centers on how the Trump administration has interpreted a five-word section of federal regulations to rationalize a “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign,” abruptly terminating billions in already awarded funding to state and local governments, research institutions, universities and more.
The full, 2020 rule promoted by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget states that federal agencies can cut off grants “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” OMB made clear that federal agencies can only terminate grants when there is evidence that the money is not achieving its intended goals or that there is cause to “significantly question” feasibility of achieving the goal.
But Trump’s administration in a Feb. 26 executive order selectively picked five words from the regulation “no longer effectuates…agency priorities” — to justify abrupt cuts to federal aid.
“In effectuating this directive, Agency Defendants now assert—for the first time— that the Clause means something completely new: That the Clause permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind,” the lawsuit states.
Since the initial order authorizing the Department of Government Efficiency to get involved in federal agency grant distributions, the same phrase has featured prominently in subsequent orders, agency memos and explanations for slashing billions of dollars in aid to a wide host of recipients across the country.

“It’s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement. “Nearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called ‘agency priorities clause.’ Here, we are proactively asking the Courts to put a stop to the nonsense. The President cannot withhold Congressionally-allocated federal funds from the states, and this clause is no loophole.”
The complaint, which names a dozen federal agency heads as defendants, offers a litany of examples of the consequences of abrupt cuts to already awarded federal grants and aid: losing habitat restoration in Maine, ending efforts to combat hate crimes in New Jersey, ceasing shelter programs for migrants in Illinois released from overcrowded federal detention centers and cutting off research of air quality risks from wildfire smoke in rural Nevada.
“With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived States of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more,” the lawsuit states.
Even federal aid still flowing remains at risk, compromising safety and support to people who qualify for food assistance programs and those who live in flood zones, farmers, minority students, scientists, and more, the lawsuit states.
Arguing that the federal administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procuredures Act, the AGs have asked a federal judge to permanently clarify that federal regulations do not grant federal agencies “unfettered power” to terminate funding already awarded. Or, as an alternative, they have asked a judge to toss the Trump administration’s interpretation of the clause in question. The request, if granted, would apply to all existing and future federal grants.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the federal agencies, declined to comment on the lawsuit in an email Tuesday.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a 16-state coalition filing an amicus brief Tuesday supporting the Trump administration’s efforts to cut some funding for Harvard University over reported claims of antisemitism on campus.
Bird, alongside 15 other attorneys general including South Carolina’s Alan Wilson, filed the brief Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by Harvard University challenging the move to strip billions in federal funding from the institution. In April, President Donald Trump’s administration paused $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $50 million in multi-year contracts for Harvard.
While the funding cut follows reports of instances of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment on campus, the decision also came after the administration demanded Harvard end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, cooperate with immigration authorities and adopt merit-based admission standards or risk losing $9 billion in research funding — demands rejected by the university.
The federal lawsuit claims the federal government’s decision to slash funding for the university is being used as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard,” and argues the research funding being impacted by the cuts is unrelated to concerns about antisemitism. Attorneys for the university have also stated the funding cut is a violation of the First Amendment, as the government’s demands include potential restrictions on material that can be taught by Harvard faculty.
But in the amicus brief filed Tuesday, Bird and the other attorneys general said the claim that the Trump administration is violating the First Amendment is invalid.
The filing points to a previous federal decision to strip tax-exempt status from private Bob Jones University. In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed 8-1 the IRS ruling that the private college in Greenville, South Carolina, was violating federal antidiscrimination laws by denying admission to applicants in interracial marriages and banning interracial dating among students. (Bob Jones didn’t regain its nonprofit status until 2017.)
The brief cites the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Bias report filed in April by Harvard University as evidence that there were repeated instances of antisemitism and an “alienating and hostile atmosphere” experienced by Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas against Israel.
“Harvard has failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students on its campus since at least October 7, 2023,” the brief states. “… Harvard invokes the First Amendment to distract from its failure to protect Jewish students in violation of Title IV, which the federal government cited as its reason for freezing funding. But the bottom line is that the First Amendment does not allow institutions to violate Title VI. Universities that accept federal funding must live up to their obligations to protect Jewish students, just like they protect students of other nationalities, ethnicities, and religions.”
Bird was joined in the brief by the attorneys general for Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.
In a news release, Bird said she and the other state officials “stand firmly with the Trump Administration and against antisemitism,” adding, “but Harvard does not.”
“When President Trump acted to fix the rampant antisemitism on Harvard’s campus by restricting federal funding, Harvard sued,” Bird said in a statement. “Harvard itself admits that antisemitism both exists and is a problem on its campus but is unwilling to address the issue. Jewish students deserve equal protection and access to education which is why I led a 16-state coalition to support President Trump’s actions.”

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio active and retired educators will have less of a voice on the state’s retired teachers’ pension fund board under the proposed final budget. Amid legislators’ concerns of an alleged corruption scheme threatening the fund, they have decided to reduce the number of elected positions and add more political appointments.
In the nearly 600 amendments to the 5,500-page operating budget bill, the conference committee led by House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, and Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, included changes to the State Teachers Retirement System. The amendment was included and announced at about 1 a.m.
A provision in the bill would change the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers — five contributing and two retired — to three elected after seats are phased out over several years. Two of the educator seats will be for actives and only one retiree seat.
Each elected member will be able to finish their term, but once they term out, four of the seven seats will not be refilled. This means that once
Retiree Rudy Fichtenbaum and actives Michael Harkness and Chad Smith — the most recently elected members — would be the remaining seats as members term off.
Those four removed educator seats will be filled with newly appointed members. Right now, the governor gets to appoint one investment expert. The Speaker of the House and the Senate President jointly appoint an expert. The treasurer gets an appointee, and so does the director of the Department of Education and Workforce.
Under this legislation, the treasurer would get two appointees, the legislative leaders get one each and one combined — equalling three, the chancellor of the Department of Higher Education gets one, and the governor and DEW get one each.
This provision was proposed by state Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, the chair of the Ohio Retirement Study Council. For months now, he has been evaluating the board makeup due to the controversy inside the fund.
“The state legislature established these pension systems and has an ongoing responsibility to ensure the long-term health of the fund for retired and active teachers,” Bird exclusively said. “The ongoing turmoil has clarified the need for the General Assembly to rebalance the Board composition.”
How we got here
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
A 14-page whistleblower memo given to Gov. Mike DeWine in May alleged a massive public corruption scandal brewing and moving quickly within STRS.
Attorney General Dave Yost soon after filed a lawsuit to remove former member Wade Steen and current Chair Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract-steering “scheme” that could directly benefit them.
The lawsuit accuses the pair of “colluding” with investment startup QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel, to secure a contract giving them 70% of the STRS assets — about $65 billion at the time. The memo accuses QED of helping to elect board members who may be more sympathetic to their proposal.
We have continued investigating the alleged scheme throughout the past year, resulting in an exclusive one-on-one interview with DeWine. He expressed his deep concerns following our April 2025 report, in which we revealed hundreds of text messages of the relationship between Steen and members of QED.
Steen and Fichtenbaum have continued to defend their innocence, arguing that Yost and DeWine are part of a “political scheme” to prevent educators who want more transparency and to change the investment structure. The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.” This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money, through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund. Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
Steen and Metcalf, the men with the relationship at the center of the conversation, also spoke with me in response to the governor’s comments in their own Q&A that can be found here.
Removal
The removal of the board members has been debated for months now.
“The Ohio Retirement Study Council has a duty to inform and advise the state legislature, and we have done that regarding our view of the STRS Board composition,” Bird continued. “Many of my fellow colleagues in the legislature are supportive of this change, which we believe will bring stability to STRS. I believe that the Governor will support this update to the STRS Board composition, as it provides greater accountability to the appointing authorities on the Board — preventing conflicts of interest and ensuring the future health of the fund.”
Educators we have spoken to have argued that the removal of elected members of the board is anti-democratic.
Retired educator Mary Binegar, who doesn’t trust the “reform” faction of the board, still says that removing the teachers’ voices is a bad move.
“Whether we like the board members are there or not, we do have the opportunity to vote for them,” Binegar said in March. “I think it’s important for educators to have that sense that there are other educators watching out for them.”
Each of the dozens of educators we spoke to said that removing their perspective from the board will hurt the fund and cause teachers to feel isolated and unheard.
Teachers have brought up the fact that when Democrats took control of the Ohio Board of Education three years ago, the GOP lawmakers swiftly took away the vast majority of their power.
However, the Republican leaders had been debating taking away their power for years, even when the GOP controlled them, since the board either took too long to implement new laws or just ignored lawmakers, according to then-Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima. The board also, instead of looking for a superintendent, debated culture war issues that they had no jurisdiction over.
Next steps
The legislation heads to each chamber for a vote. The budget deadline is at the end of June.
We will continue breaking down the massive budget bill in the coming days.

The MBTA has sued a union representing inspectors who work for the public transit agency, arguing it should be able to fire a supervisor who it says engaged in sexual and racial harassment.
The post MBTA sues union in effort to fire supervisor in misconduct case appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE MBTA HAS sued a union representing inspectors who work for the transit agency, arguing the T should be able to fire a supervisor who the agency says engaged in sexual and racial harassment. 
The complaint, filed in Suffolk Superior Court on June 9, details allegations of misconduct and the MBTA’s firing of the supervisor, Patrick Goggin, a former chief inspector. 
The OPEIU MBTA Inspector’s Union Local 600, of which Goggin is a member, fought the firing and took the transit agency to arbitration, a dispute resolution procedure allowed under the collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the union. The union won reinstatement for Goggin, leading to the MBTA’s lawsuit. 
After a hearing held over several days last year, an arbitrator declared in May that the T had “sufficiently proven” Goggin committed the misconduct in violation of the agency’s rules and zero-tolerance policies, and the T had “just cause” to discipline him, according to the MBTA’s complaint. 
But the arbitrator nonetheless ordered the T to reinstate the supervisor to his former position, or an equivalent one, without back pay, ruling that firing him was too severe a penalty. In doing so, the arbitrator “exceeded his authority” and the decision “violates public policy and is otherwise contrary to law and therefore unenforceable,” the MBTA’s attorneys argued in the complaint. 
An MBTA spokesman declined to comment, citing pending litigation. A lawyer for the union, Daniel Fogarty, did not respond to a request for comment, nor did a union official. Goggin was unreachable for comment. 
The case is an example of the sort of outcome of the arbitration process, particularly in the public sector, that has drawn criticism from those who say it makes it too difficult to fire employees who have engaged in what appears to be egregious misconduct or poor performance. In a prominent recent example, a Boston police officer who was fired twice based on separate incidents still got his job back after taking the matter to arbitration. 
“It’s a real problem, a cost of union representation,” said Samuel Estreicher, director of the Center for Labor and Employment Law at New York University. “If the union mounts a vigorous defense, the arbitrator will be reluctant to sustain the discharge unless the culprit is a serious repeat offender.” 
The T’s complaint attached the arbitrator’s summary of the two sides’ arguments in laying out his decision. The union argued the T “failed to prove” that Goggin made a sexual comment to a subordinate, and her version of what was said was “inconsistent and undermines her credibility,” according to the summary. Meanwhile, others who complained about Goggin, the summary of the union argument said, had “motive to advance false allegations” against him. 
The MBTA also didn’t produce sufficient evidence to establish that Goggin treated women of color differently, the union added. 
Goggin served as chief inspector on the T’s Red Line since 2018, a position of “significant responsibility,” according to the T. Chief inspectors manage crews, handle schedules, and respond to incidents and emergencies. 
A subordinate employee lodged a complaint in July 2022, alleging “she and other Black co-workers had been subjected to discriminatory and inappropriate behavior and harassment by Mr. Goggin on the basis of gender and race,” the T’s lawsuit said. 
T officials investigated the complaint and found that Goggin “made an inappropriate comment of a sexual nature about a female subordinate’s breasts … and that he treated female employees of color differently than others, holding them to stricter standards of conduct,” according to the complaint, which also cited “prior disciplinary history.” 
As part of the arbitration process, an arbitrator, John Marra, was hired after the T moved to fire Goggin. The arbitrator found Goggin’s denials “not credible,” and credited testimony from witnesses that Goggin would “make obscene gestures at work,” refer to his penis size, and call women “bitches,” according to the T’s lawsuit. 
But the arbitrator added that the T’s move to fire him was “too severe and not appropriate,” and ordered the agency to reinstate him. The arbitrator said there was “no evidence” that Goggin had been informed by management that his behavior was inappropriate and offensive, and that his job was in jeopardy.  
In its complaint, the T claimed that in a separate incident Goggin received a written warning in October 2020 after allegedly telling a Black female subordinate to get “[her] ass back on” on a train, and when she said she needed to use to restroom first, he allegedly said, “[d]o you need me to wipe it for you?” 
“By concluding that even though there was just cause to discipline Mr. Goggin for his proven and unremorseful violations of the MBTA’s anti-discrimination policies and other rules of behavioral conduct, Mr. Goggin should be reinstated to his supervisory position, the Arbitrator has fashioned a remedy that is inconsistent with the MBTA’s legal obligations to take prompt and effective measures to effectively correct and address discriminator harassment,” the T’s complaint said. 
Marra, the arbitrator, concluded that the T “properly conducted” an investigation, seeking statements from other T employees. “The Union makes a compelling case that the arbitrator should not rely on hearsay evidence,” Marra wrote. “However, in the interest of a fair result, arbitrators may consider hearsay evidence in order to obtain the most complete view of the facts.” 
The hearsay was corroborated by testimony and witness accounts, Marra added.  
Goggin’s “actions fell short of the high standards” expected of a chief inspector and showed no remorse, Marra said. But firing him is “too severe,” given his work history, and nine years of employment, during which Goggin earned several promotions.

Ohio legislative leaders say a compromise has been reached on the state’s operating budget — sharing early details that the wealthy will get a tax cut and the Cleveland Browns get hundreds of millions for their new stadium. Despite efforts, there has been no word on education funding as of Tuesday evening.
The lawmakers have been writing like they’re running out of time. Because they are. The legislation must be passed by the end of June.
“I think all big remaining issues are resolved,” Ohio House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said.
Stewart gave some details before the legislation is officially announced.
The Senate leaders had non-negotiables that Stewart had to deal with.
One of those Senate non-negotiables is its 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of more than $1.1 billion in the general revenue fund. That money was made up by cutting funding for Ohio House lawmakers’ community projects. Stewart said last week that those provisions were priorities to him. He got them back in.
“We found a way to give that important tax relief to Ohioans while also doing a lot of the priorities that we had here in the house,” he said.
He said that the House is agreeing with the Senate to rescind an awful lot of small income and sales tax exemptions.
“Individually, they’re it’s not that much money at issue, but when you put them all cumulatively together — it’s a sizeable amount of money that we are going to return to the state,” he said.
Other than that, the lawmakers would be shifting a pool of money from interest earned on state funds and different accounts to the general revenue fund, he added.
The lawmakers also agreed on a plan for the Cleveland Browns’ new stadium.
They ultimately opted to draw millions from the unclaimed property fund, providing a cash grant for the Browns using other people’s money. The state is holding $4.8 billion in unclaimed funds from old bank accounts, uncashed checks, utility deposits, life insurance payouts, retirement savings accounts and stocks and bonds.
Stewart said the final budget proposal calls for the state to take ownership of $1.7 billion of that money. Lawmakers are earmarking $600 million for the Browns and putting $400 million into a special sports and culture fund, which could pay for other projects.
Democrats had not seen the budget as of Tuesday evening. New House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, said that the inclusion of the flat tax will disproportionately hurt lower-income and middle-class families.
“Because of the choices that the Majority has made, they are choosing to serve a sliver of the state, and it’s the sliver that needs the least support,” Isaacsohn said.
Stewart said the House is making sure that social programs will be included.
“We’re still going to take care of all the major programs I think Ohioans expect us to do,” the chair said.
One of the main differences between the House and the Senate was how much they allocated to public schools. Both cut hundreds of millions from the expected budget, but the Senate restored the current funding formula and gave $100 million back. Democrats aren’t optimistic that additional education support will be given.
“We are also working to fix as many bad things as we can,” House Finance Committee Ranking Member Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, said.
The final budget should be voted out by the end of the week.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator. Aerial support provided by SouthWings.)Bayou Sauvage Urban National Wildlife Refuge, an area of marshland at the eastern edge of New Orleans, is — in biological terms — considered an area full of wetlands.
One of the last remaining marshes around lakes Ponchartrain and Borgne, the wildlife refuge contains estuaries and freshwater lagoons, where young fish, crabs and hundreds of species of birds find safe haven and food. Visitors and locals kayak in the bayous and hike through the marsh, while the city itself enjoys an added layer of flood protection provided by the presence of nearby wetlands.
But Bayou Sauvage no longer fits the legal definition of protected wetland under a new Louisiana law. The new definition excludes areas surrounded by levees, now called “fastlands.”  Also excluded are wetlands that are naturally separated from what’s known as Waters of the United States (WOTUS), the navigable rivers and lakes protected under the federal Clean Water Act.
Much of Bayou Sauvage was sealed behind levees in the 1950s, said Matt Rota, senior policy director for environmental advocacy group Healthy Gulf.
“A reading of this law … could say that all of Bayou Sauvage, thousands of acres of wetlands, are now not protected,” Rota said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Act 105 became law when Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed it June 8, making Louisiana the latest state to roll back protections from development in isolated wetlands. The new policy is inspired by the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency. Justices ruled, in a 5-4 vote, the EPA does not have the authority under the Clean Water Act to require a federal permit to dredge and fill wetlands isolated from WOTUS.
While Bayou Sauvage is still protected as a national wildlife refuge, other wetland areas with strong environmental value may now see openings to unfettered development under Louisiana law.
Tennessee and North Carolina have also redefined wetlands in their state laws following Sackett. Though the three states differ in how they now regulate building in wetland areas, all have the same goal: allowing more wetland development.
Jumping the gun
William Sutton, a wildlife ecologist and assistant professor at Tennessee State University, said isolated wetlands in his state play a vital role in preserving biodiversity and habitat for species such as the mole salamander, acting as “islands” of habitat spread across the region. It’s evolved in conjunction with isolated wetlands like those in Tennessee, said Sutton, and can’t just pack up and leave when development moves in.
“It’s not like these animals all of a sudden shift their life history to live in these different types of wetlands once you remove these isolated wetlands,” he said. “Once you remove that wetland, these animals can’t adapt to other wetlands that have things like high fish abundance or also things like high heavy metals or high nutrient loads.”
Rota said isolated wetlands areas are “still vital to the environment.” They can soak up millions of gallons of stormwater and runoff that would otherwise flood homes, he said.
The Environmental Protection Agency had previously considered isolated wetlands to be under their jurisdiction, requiring permits to fill or otherwise develop them. But the Sackett decision held that only wetlands with a continuous surface connection to WOTUS fall under Clean Water Act protections from draining and filling.
Proponents of Mid-Barataria diversion warn against abandoning wetlands   

Clear guidance as to what “continuous” surface water connection means is something the Sackett decision didn’t provide. The EPA, now tasked with rewriting the definition of WOTUS, recently held a series of listening sessions across the country to gather guidance from stakeholders.
But Louisiana and other states are not waiting for a new federal definition.
Wetland advocates and law experts are concerned that approving state legislation that redefines wetlands before the EPA comes up with a national definition is hasty, with the potential to introduce flooding risks and water quality issues in newly developed areas.
“We would prefer that they wait until the EPA makes a clear definition,” said Angelle Bradford with the Sierra Club’s Louisiana-based Delta chapter.
“We are constantly fighting and worrying about flooding in coastal Louisiana,” Rota said. “Wetlands that are cut off by levees that are filled in, that’s going to reduce our flood protection and our storm resilience, not to mention reducing vital habitat.”
Basin battles
Throughout the Mississippi River Basin, states are taking different approaches to governing wetlands post-Sackett.
What might be biologically considered a wetland, using indicators such as the type of soil and plants in the area as well as water saturation on and below the surface, is now different from what is legally defined as a protected wetland area in Louisiana.
The state’s new law attempts to restrict the legal definition of wetlands to only cover areas with a “continuous” connection to rivers, lakes or other navigable bodies of water. Areas isolated from navigable waters or cut off by levees are now considered “fastlands” under the law, and don’t require a government permit to build on them — even if they have the biological features of a wetland.
But just like the Sackett decision, Louisiana’s law doesn’t clearly define what “continuous” means. Environmentalists say this sows confusion.
“It just doesn’t provide people with a clear understanding of what is going to be protected and what is not,” said Brennan Spoor, staff attorney with the environmental advocacy group Atchafalaya Basinkeeper in Louisiana. The new law “gives too many outlets” for “lack of consistency” in enforcing which areas need permits and which don’t, he added.
The new measure also tries to restrict the definition of wetlands under what critics say is the wrong part of Louisiana law. The new definition falls under the Louisiana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, but in question is a developer’s ability to fill a wetland, not pollute it. The state relies on the federal Clean Water Act’s rules to regulate wetland fill and for now the federal rules are up in the air.
“If this is meant to narrow Louisiana law, it can’t without federal approval,” said Mark Davis, a Tulane University environmental law professor.
Louisiana’s new law also tries to erase the need for permits to build in wetlands cut off by existing or future legal levee construction. Even if that levee is built illegally, there’s a possibility that after-the-fact permitting will disqualify more wetlands from protections, Spoor said.
“It’s just going to be whatever a judge thinks, and a judge in some parish that supports wetlands might feel differently than a judge who thinks all industry should get to do whatever they want,” Spoor said.
Rota also worries the law could spur illegal construction or pollution by infusing “misguided” attempts to narrow the state’s definition of wetlands.
“If it’s not clear what a fastland is, I think that’ll give people a lot more impetus to just [decide] ‘if in doubt, dump, and then ask for forgiveness later,’” said Rota.
States start to update regulations
In Tennessee, relatively robust state wetland protections were repealed earlier this year. The state used to require developers to mitigate new development on wetlands as a tradeoff for building in swampy, water-saturated areas. Instead, it now uses a scoring system for isolated wetlands, classifying them into one of four categories: low-quality, moderate-quality, high-quality or artificial wetlands.
‘Low-quality’ isolated wetlands under one acre don’t need a permit to drain or fill, while ‘moderate-quality’ wetlands need to be under a quarter-acre. ‘Artificial wetlands’— created by either humans or animals — aren’t subject to any regulatory oversight for draining or filling.
About 80% of Tennessee’s isolated wetlands are smaller than one acre, said Grace Stranch, CEO of Tennessee environmental group Harpeth River Conservancy.
While regulations for building in low or moderate quality wetlands increase with their size – and “high quality” wetlands are subject to stricter standards – Sutton said magnitude doesn’t really correlate directly with a wetland’s value to the ecosystem.
“Isolated wetlands can be very small but can have really, really rich biodiversity,” he said.
Smaller, isolated wetlands are also harder to create artificially than larger systems, so it’s difficult to restore them after they are damaged, Sutton said.
“There’s really no way to guarantee it because the hydrology is just so hard to control in these wetlands, once you actually have to come back and reconstruct.”
‘A living laboratory’: An accidental delta taught Louisiana scientists how to rebuild wetlands

The law now also gives Tennessee’s conservation commissioner a lot of power to independently expand acreage requirements for low- to moderate-quality wetlands. If the commissioner decides to broaden the law to larger parcels, it could leave the final fate of even more wetland areas uncertain.
Developers also no longer have to consider the cumulative impact of altering these wetlands on surrounding areas or water quality before dredging or filling them.
“Wetlands are directly connected to our river sources,” said Stranch, adding that many wetlands geographically isolated from one another can be connected in other ways, such as hydrologically or ecologically.
“They’re just not connected on the surface, and so that’s one of our biggest issues,” she said.
Water also flows across state boundaries; one state with stronger wetland protections may be impacted by things like nutrient runoff or increased floodwaters as a result of a different state’s’ wetland protection policy.
“It opens the floodgates,” said Jon D. Bumpus, spokesman for the environmental advocacy group TennGreen Land Conservancy.
“Going from a state that very staunchly protects wetlands to sending the message to developers … that this land is no longer off limits just sets a really, really dangerous immediate precedent that’s going to change a whole lot of things very quickly,” Bumpus said.
While there are ways to promote responsible development with tools like land easements and buffer zones built between houses and wetland areas, Bumpus said the new law doesn’t promote these types of adaptive strategies.
North Carolina, where rivers in its western region feed into the Mississippi River Basin, rolled back wetland protections so that only wetlands with WOTUS connection qualify for protection from being dredged or filled.
Lawmakers in the North Carolina General Assembly overrode a veto from Gov. Roy Cooper in order to update their law, which specifies the new EPA definition of wetlands, once established, will replace the state definition.
Other states in the Mississippi Basin, such as Indiana, have also passed laws to narrow the definition of wetlands and strip protections.
Some states, including Minnesota and Illinois, have extended wetlands protections.
‘The Light Switch,” Episode 5: Wading through the politics of wetlands restoration

Wisconsin has extended protection for non-federal, isolated wetlands, but the state’s authority doesn’t extend to federal wetland areas. That means the Prairie Pothole Region, comprising thousands of small wetlands in the state, and other isolated marshes are left without Clean Water Act protection after Sackett.
Given its history of flood control issues and valuable wetland habitat, Davis suggested Louisiana would be better off among the states expanding protections rather than rolling them back.
Louisiana Sen. Michael Fesi, who introduced Louisiana’s legislation to redefine wetlands, thinks easing wetlands regulation post-Sackett could incentivize levee construction and aid in flood protection. But legal experts and environmental advocates say that’s a red herring.
“One of the easiest ways to help with flood protection is to be careful about what you build in flood-prone areas,” Davis said, adding that tools such as building codes are an easier legal avenue to codify flood protection.
“Louisiana should not be one of those states that says, ‘Well, the Supreme Court says the Clean Water Act doesn’t apply as widely as it had before, so we shouldn’t do anything either,’” he said. “The real question is: What needs doing and how do we do it?”

The Missouri Supreme Court last week issued a warrant for the execution of Lance Shockley, who recently exhausted his state and federal appeals and was convicted of the 2005 murder of Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl Dewayne Graham Jr. 
The court announced the execution date on Tuesday afternoon.
Graham was shot and killed in his rural Carter County driveway. Graham had been investigating Shockley’s role in a fatal drunk driving accident, which the prosecution argued gave Shockley the motive to kill him. Shockley has insisted he’s innocent.
A jury in 2009 found Shockley guilty of first-degree murder. But in the punishment phase of Shockley’s trial, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on whether he should be executed. 
In most states with active death penalty laws, that deadlock would have resulted in the defendant being sentenced to life without parole. 
But under Missouri law, Shockley’s penalty case then got handed off to a Carter County circuit judge who, after independent review, sentenced him to death.
Group of Republican lawmakers raise concerns about Missouri death penalty

Only Missouri and Indiana give judges the authority to unilaterally decide on the death penalty, a fact that over the years has drawn scrutiny from those who believe it places too much power in the hands of one person and denies defendants their constitutional rights to trial by jury and protection against cruel and unusual punishment.
In 2023 Amber McLaughlin was executed because of the unilateral decision of a trial judge. Several retired judges opposed the execution in a letter to then-Gov. Mike Parson, calling it a “flaw in Missouri’s capital sentencing scheme.”
An analysis included in an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court organized by the national nonprofit watchdog group Project on Government Oversight found Missouri judges, who are elected in most parts of the state, have been more likely than juries to impose death sentences. 
In cases without jury deadlock, from 2000 to 2018, the jury imposed a death sentence in 64% of cases. But in deadlocked cases with a trial judge making the decision, the death penalty was imposed in 86% of cases, according to the brief.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers in recent years have filed legislation to eliminate judge-imposed executions, but the proposals have made little progress.

Shockley has denied his involvement in Graham’s death, citing the lack of physical evidence or eyewitnesses. His attorneys have tried unsuccessfully to get evidence from the crime scene tested for DNA and have argued the police failed to investigate other possible suspects.
“Shockley’s defense at trial was that he was not the one who killed Sgt. Graham,” his attorney wrote in a brief last month. “Shockley has never wavered in that position.” 
His attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The prosecution said Shockley borrowed a relative’s car the afternoon of Graham’s death and the car matched the description witnesses gave of one parked near Graham’s house the afternoon of his murder. Prosecutors also argued the recovered bullets may have been consistent with the caliber of a rifle Shockley owned. No murder weapon was found.
The Missouri Supreme Court, responding to the defense’s argument that the death penalty was excessive or disproportionate punishment for a case relying on circumstantial proof, said courts have previously upheld death sentences in cases hinging on strong circumstantial evidence and here, “the circumstantial evidence was strong.”
Shockley would be the first person executed in Missouri this year, barring intervention from Gov. Mike Kehoe or the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Last year, Missouri executed four people. It was one of four states responsible for 76% of executions that year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_9656-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 10:02:02.768263

California courts have failed to report hundreds of vehicular manslaughter convictions to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles over the past five years, allowing deadly drivers to improperly keep their licenses, a CalMatters investigation has found.
Drivers like Marvin Salazar.
Salazar was convicted in May 2023 for felony vehicular manslaughter after a crash that killed his friend, court records show. Under California law, that’s supposed to be an automatic three-year loss of driving privileges.
But the Los Angeles County Superior Court didn’t report the conviction to the DMV. Two months later, the agency issued Salazar his most recent license. Since then, he has received two speeding tickets and been in another collision, records show. 

Gaudy Lemus, whose son, 18-year-old Joseph Ramirez, died in the crash: “How can he keep driving? We wanted consequences for him. Remove his driver’s license.”

Investigative reporters Lauren Hepler and Robert Lewis uncovered the error and others like it by cross-checking convictions in vehicular manslaughter cases against motorists’ DMV records, as part of an ongoing investigation. Earlier this year, CalMatters reported that the agency routinely allows people with horrifying histories of dangerous driving — including fatal crashes, DUIs and numerous tickets — to keep driving. 
When courts were alerted to the problem, officials at most county court systems responded quickly, thanked CalMatters’ reporters for telling them, acknowledged the mistake and indicated that they would report the convictions to the DMV.

Tara Leal, the court executive officer in Kern County: “They were errors on our part. I’m not going to sugarcoat it.”

The reporting is already forcing change. So far, nearly 200 drivers who’ve killed have had their driving privileges suspended or revoked as a result of CalMatters’ story, updated DMV reports show. While some already had a separate license suspension, 70 appear to have had a valid license before the agency took action in response to the story.

Dems attempt to counter masked federal agents

Amid reports of federal agents conducting immigration raids while driving unmarked vehicles, covering their faces and wearing vests emblazoned with the words “police,” another Democratic legislator is proposing a measure that would make it easier to identify California law enforcement officers.
On Monday Pasadena Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez introduced Senate Bill 805 to require local and state officers to “visibly display identification” when carrying out their duties. The measure would also prohibit bounty hunters from engaging in immigration enforcement.
Though California can’t compel the federal government to obey state laws, the bill would authorize local law enforcement to request identification from someone — such as federal immigration enforcement agents — if there is a reasonable suspicion they are impersonating a police officer.
Pérez’s proposal follows another bill unveiled last week by two Bay Area Democratic senators, which would prohibit local law enforcement officers from covering their faces. Peace Officers Research Association of California, a statewide law enforcement organization, came out against that bill, calling it “ill-conceived” and “unnecessary.”



Report: Only a few companies moved HQs in last decade

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
Less than 2% of California’s 47,000 companies moved their headquarters out of state from 2011 to 2021, and the state only lost 3.9% of its jobs during that period.
That’s according to a new report from the Public Policy Institute of California. The report also found, as CalMatters wrote last year, that companies that relocated their headquarters retained many employees in the state. 
Still, there’s no denying that headquarters exits are trending upward, and that California taxes and regulations play a role, the report said.
About 150 headquarters left in 2011 compared with more than 200 in 2021. But also, over that decade, the report said about 7,250 headquarters opened in the state, and that “new headquarters tend to have many fewer jobs at the outset.” 
David Neumark, an economics professor and one of the report’s authors, said that while “high-profile events make the news,” smaller company openings barely make the news.
The most recent example: John Paul Mitchell Systems, the shampoo maker, is moving its headquarters from Beverly Hills to Texas.

Five years after COVID shut down most California high schools, today’s college  students describe a difficult transition to adulthood, marked by fear, loss and a lack of preparation.


As the world settled into pandemic life, students who graduated from high school during the COVID-19 crisis started new chapters of their lives in social and academic seclusion.
Many spent their senior year on Zoom, without homecomings, proms or graduations. They struggled to pass classes and navigate college applications. And they entered college with gaps in study skills and anxiety about social interactions.
They spent their first year of college — typically a time of discovery — in online classes or alone in dorm rooms. Now, some are graduating from college, while others simply gave up. 
Across California students grappled with transitioning to college during the pandemic. The challenges were magnified in the Inland Empire, where only about a quarter of all adults hold four-year degrees, compared to 37% statewide.
“I felt really lonely, and it was really, really stressful at that time,” said Maribel Gamez-Reyes, A UC Riverside student from Inglewood.
Holes in their education
Especially for students who are the first in their families to attend college, what should have been their moment of triumph became months of tension. Some questioned whether they even belonged on a college campus, said UC Riverside Dean of Students Christine Mata. 
“During lockdown students weren’t able to bond and build connections to the institution, or even access support structures,” she said.
Their academic shortfalls and social isolation took a toll. UC Riverside found that math and writing skills were lower among the students who graduated from high school during the pandemic than for previous high school graduates.
In 2019, before COVID, about 13% of incoming freshmen entered UC Riverside at the lowest math level. In 2020 about 20% of freshmen — the class that lost nearly half its senior year to the pandemic — fell into the lowest math tier.
The 2021 class of high school graduates saw the percentage of low-performing math students tick up even more, to 22%. Those students had spent half their junior year and nearly all their senior year in remote learning. 
Likewise, 25% of freshmen entered the university at the lowest writing level in 2019. In 2020 32% fell into the bottom tier. The following year 29% of incoming students started at the lowest writing level. 
Math and English levels among incoming freshmen have improved in the past couple of years, university data show.

Grade inflation in high school contributed to those pandemic-era gaps, said Lesley Davidson-Boyd, associate vice president of California State University, San Bernardino. Some high school seniors graduated at the time with stellar grades but below-average test scores in math and English, she said. 
“There were a lot of holes in their education,” she said. “There were vital pieces that were missing.”
The federal government sent schools billions in extra pandemic funding, but much of California’s higher education money was not spent on helping students catch up academically.
California received about $34 billion in pandemic aid to education, with about $10 billion of that dedicated to colleges and universities, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Of that, $4 billion was direct aid to students, for help with tuition and other college expenses.
Institutions got $5.3 billion and spent some of that on technology to accommodate remote learning. But much of it went to replacing lost revenue, which administrators said backfilled losses from campus and dormitory closures, and enrollment declines.

Enrollment also took a hit at some California colleges and universities, including many Inland Empire campuses. While enrollment in the University of California system overall has climbed steadily since 2020, it remained flat at UC Riverside since 2020. In the decade before the pandemic, its four-year graduation rate climbed from less than 50% to 67%. But that slid to 60% for the class that started in 2020.
California State Universities’ enrollment numbers dropped during the pandemic, and while admissions finally started rebounding system-wide, it has continued to decline at Cal State San Bernardino from more than 20,000 in 2019 to less than 18,000 in 2024. Four-year graduation rates at Cal State San Bernardino had nearly doubled, from about 13% in 2009, to 25% in 2019, before dropping slightly for the class that started during the first year of the pandemic, in 2020.
Enrollment at the California Community College system fell sharply during the pandemic, but has rebounded throughout the state, including the Inland Empire.
Adriana Banda: Playing catch-up
Pandemic graduates who did go to college often played catch-up in their first year, trying to recover academic skills they lost during remote learning.
For Adriana Banda, pandemic education was a lonely exercise in perseverance. Desert Hot Springs High School offered students the chance to go back in person on limited class schedules, with social distancing precautions, but some of Banda’s family members faced medical risks, so it was a “no-brainer” to stay home and learn remotely, she said.
“I had to learn on my own,” said Banda, now 22. “I honestly didn’t learn much that year. I was just trying to get through high school.”

For years she had looked forward to senior milestones — prom, grad night, a senior sunset gathering and weekends with friends — but she watched them fall away as COVID-19 persisted.
“Having all of my senior experiences taken away from me was really disappointing and discouraging,” she said.
Banda plodded through Zoom classes and graduated high school in 2021. She became the first in her family to go to college when she enrolled at Cal State San Bernardino’s Palm Desert campus. 
“Transitioning into college was honestly really hard, especially after coming from a year of remote learning,” she said. “I think during that year I lost the foundational skills I had in school.”
Professors expected high-level work but didn’t always help students struggling with pandemic learning loss, she said.
“The professors didn’t really capture the idea that these students might need more help and support, because of the fact that they weren’t learning in a regular environment for the past year and a half,” Banda said.
“I had a six-month gap because I didn’t know exactly where to start, and I didn’t have the guidance because nobody in my family was in college.” Katie Honeycutt, a San Bernardino Valley College student who dropped her classes to take a job
The social disruption was even worse: “I’m naturally a shy person, so transitioning from a year full of almost no social communication to being back in the classroom and having to make these relationships and friendships work was really, really hard.”
Getting a campus job at the social services office got her out of her shell. In that role she had to engage with other students but noticed many weren’t receptive.
“People just generally weren’t comfortable having regular conversations anymore,” Banda said. “They would avoid eye contact and get nervous.” 
Banda is scheduled to graduate in spring 2026 and plans to pursue a master’s degree and a career as a hospital social worker. The tough lessons of the pandemic will guide her work, she said.

“Seeing how much people genuinely can struggle, and how limited help is, going into social work I’m going to keep that in my head,” she said. “I’m always going to try to the best of my ability to help people.”
Bringing back campus life
Reestablishing campus culture and student life might seem like a lower priority than boosting academic performance in the wake of the pandemic, but university leaders say they’re intertwined. Without connections to classmates and professors, students feel less committed to college.
“Students don’t have the will to stay in school if they don’t feel connected to the campus,” Davidson-Boyd, of Cal State San Bernardino, said. “We saw a rise in dropout rates, and we know that doesn’t just have to do with academics, but connectability to campus as well.”
First year continuation rates for the campus fell, from almost 85% for students who started in 2019 to 78% for those who started in 2020 and 80% for those who started in 2021.
While universities typically encourage students to take a full course load and push through challenging classes, Cal State San Bernardino tried to keep students in school by making it easier for them to drop classes without penalties.
Most students who tried to withdraw from classes but couldn’t do so wound up failing anyway. After two failed classes, many gave up, Davidson-Boyd said: “This was a way to give them an out so they feel like they have more agency over the process.”
Even after pandemic restrictions loosened, campuses continued virtual instruction for some classes and kept dorms at reduced occupancy.

“During lockdown students weren’t able to bond and build connections to the institution, or even access support structures,” Mata said. “They remember being lonely. They were trying to figure out college and it wasn’t what they thought it would be at that time.”
That disengagement hindered attendance and participation during and after the pandemic, Davidson-Boyd said.
“A lot of our students who are failing classes, it’s not that they don’t understand the content,” she said. “They’re just not showing up. Professors are saying that when students are in class they’re not engaged in the same way.”
Cal State San Bernardino reinforced study skills through summer programs for some incoming students, with primers on writing fundamentals and “how-to college math,” she said. And the university introduced a freshman course with tips on identifying their interests, participating in campus events and even asking instructors for help.
Maribel Gamez-Reyes: College application panic
Maribel Gamez-Reyes’ senior year at St. Mary’s Academy, an all-girls Catholic High School in  Inglewood, was a marathon of Zoom classes and digital homework. 
She struggled with virtual math lessons,  and spent so much time online she needed a new glasses prescription for eye strain.
Meanwhile her friendships faded, and lively, campus-wide assemblies she looked forward to were cancelled.
“That was disappointing,” said Gamez-Reyes, now 21. “It was overwhelming, because I realized I wasn’t going to experience all that, and there was this lingering fear because I didn’t know what to expect.”

College applications triggered panic attacks, she said, even with online help from her high school counselor and English teacher.
“I was literally overthinking every decision I was making.”
Gamez-Reyes was excited to be admitted to UC Riverside, but life on campus sparked more stress. The first semester most of her classes were online, which kept her confined to her dorm room and took the joy out of her favorite subject, English.  One of her few in-person classes was a math course, but it was held in a large lecture hall and required students to wear masks.
“I had so much anxiety about coming here,” she said. “But even then I tried to push forward because it was my first choice.”
Her mom kept her grounded. “My mom never went to college, and she was very proud of me for going to college … She said, ‘I know you’re scared and you don’t know people, but you have to try.’”
Maribel Gamez-Reyes struggled with isolation during remote learning  at UC Riverside, but working on the campus newspaper got her out of her shell. Video by Kyle Grillot for CalMatters
Gamez-Reyes started small. She chose a residence hall known for its social life, with an open layout that encouraged students to hang out in the hallway or lounge.
She eventually found her niche at the college newspaper, the Highlander, first as a contributing writer and then as arts and entertainment editor, where she oversaw coverage of books, fashion, movies and concerts. She made friends in the newsroom and met people while covering live events. She is scheduled to graduate this year and plans to pursue a PhD program in English.
“I’ve found these spaces where I feel really comfortable, and I’ve excelled overall,” Gamez-Reyes said.  “Even though I didn’t get to experience some of these exciting moments in high school, I’m experiencing that now.”
Small steps toward socializing
Social avoidance was the norm for pandemic graduates, Mata said. Whether because of fear of infection or the months of isolation, students were wary of parties and preferred simple outdoor events, she said.
“The very basic activities that pre-pandemic students wouldn’t be interested in, like a carnival, when we came back to campus, those were the things students gravitated to,” she said.
Outdoor movie nights also were a hit, offering the right balance of space and social interaction.
“It’s almost like starting small and drawing them out with very basic interactions to break down that social isolation that they developed,” Mata said.
At Cal State San Bernardino fraternity and sorority recruitment declined, along with other clubs and activities, Davidson-Boyd said. Students weren’t just feeling antisocial, she said. They were also scared.
“We instilled some panic that just being around other people could get you sick,” she said. “So I think we’re deprogramming that now.”
Carson Fajardo: Drawing students out of dorm rooms
Early in the pandemic, Carson Fajardo was optimistic that Rancho Cucamonga High School would reopen after a few weeks, in time for an assembly he was planning as student treasurer. He felt “bummed and discouraged” when it became clear that school wouldn’t resume in person that year or even the next.
“The class of 2020 got it pretty bad because they didn’t get graduation or prom,” said Fajardo, now 22. “But I still stand on the fact that the class of 2021 had it way worse, because we had everything taken from us. Not only was it junior prom and opportunities, but almost our entire senior year.”

During his senior year Fajardo kept busy with virtual student government meetings and planned fundraisers with local boba shops and pizza places. He played Call of Duty and sometimes fell asleep in Zoom class.
He thought that was all behind him once he entered Cal State San Bernardino as a business major in 2021. 
“Because I felt thwarted in my high school career, I took that to heart in my college career and really wanted to make the most of it,” he said. 
Fajardo became a programming coordinator for his residence hall. But it was an uphill battle to get anyone to join in activities.
“Only a few extroverted people were coming out to these events, but the introverted students were stuck in their dorm rooms and not wanting to come out,” he said.
Students welcomed low-key gatherings such as video nights or arts-and-crafts sessions. But a “homecoming-esqe small dance party” with a DJ, theme and decorations drew only 50 guests.
“We tried to bring back some of what was lost, but it just didn’t pan out well,” he said. “It just fell on its face.”
“There were a lot of holes in their education. There were vital pieces that were missing.”Lesley Davidson-Boyd, associate vice president of California State University, San Bernardino.
Some classes also were disappointing. Although professors found students disengaged, Fajardo thought some professors were also checked out, recycling online lessons from the remote learning period for use in asynchronous classes, where students work at their own pace.
“They taught online through COVID and then reposted their lectures for asynchronous classes where they don’t need to teach and can count it as a class, when all they’re doing is clicking a button,” he said. “There’s no real interaction, no feedback from professors in some of these classes.”
In his junior year Fajardo ran for student government president and won, which gave him a bigger platform to “build back campus culture.” Drawing on his dorm experience, he tried to offer something for everyone. A “Cosmic Coyote” night drew 900 students with laid-back bowling rounds, karaoke, line dancing and a high-energy mosh pit outside. That became an annual event, and a lesson in leadership for Fajardo.
“I think a lot of my growth as a leader came in because before I was more oblivious to what other people’s interests are, or what I think other people’s interests are,” he said.
Carson Fajardo became a programming coordinator for his residence hall. But it was in an uphill battle to get anyone to join in activities. Video by Kyle Grillot for CalMatters
The largest production that year was “Coyote Fest,” which drew about 7,000 people to a concert featuring rapper Schoolboy Q, along with rides, slides, a ferris wheel, mechanical bull and jousting.
Fajardo graduated in May and plans to pursue a master’s degree and a career in nonprofit fundraising.
“It’s cool for me, starting on the campus and seeing where it was when I first got here, in comparison to where it is now,” he said. “Tradition is the backbone of campus culture.”
Maintaining motivation to graduate
One challenge to keeping students in college comes from the regional job market, Boyd-Davidson said. After all, pay at many warehouse jobs in the Inland Empire start at about $20 per hour and can rise to $35 per hour or more for supervisory positions.
“The Inland Empire has some of the lowest graduation rates in the country,” she said. “We know we’re fighting an uphill battle to get students in school and keep them in school, especially because at warehouse jobs, which we’re surrounded by, the wages are so high.”
For students paying their own bills or helping support families, the payoff of a college degree isn’t always obvious, she said. 
Katie Honeycutt, 21, graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino in 2021 and enrolled at San Bernardino Valley College in a pharmacy technician program in spring, 2022.
“I had a six-month gap because I didn’t know exactly where to start, and I didn’t have the guidance because nobody in my family was in college,” Honeycutt said.
While she enjoyed some in-person college classes, she switched to online classes to coordinate with her work schedule as a supervisor at Ross Dress for Less. The virtual college courses were just as hard as remote learning in high school, she said, and she was missing math skills and other fundamentals she should have learned in her senior year.
“I ended up dropping (the classes), because it was just too much to handle all at once,” Honeycutt said. “I do have stuff to pay, and I can’t just focus on just school.”
Rather than only highlighting the financial rewards of a college degree, Davidson-Boyd said university officials gained traction by discussing the less immediate benefits of higher education: the greater range of career choices college graduates have and the opportunity to contribute to their communities.
While students who started college during the pandemic still feel a sense of loss or hardship,  many who graduate have a sense of accomplishment for having made it through. 
“There’s resiliency, because of what they had to face in starting their collegiate journey,” Mata  said. “I just remind them how special they are and how proud they should be.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/051925_Pandemic-Graduates_KG_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-25 09:03:06.597141

Marvin Salazar was convicted in May 2023 for killing his 18-year-old friend Joseph Ramirez, who was in the passenger seat when Salazar gunned his car, lost control and slammed into a tree, court records show. Under California law, the state should have taken away Salazar’s driving privileges for at least three years.
But the Los Angeles County Superior Court didn’t report the conviction to the DMV. Two months later, the agency issued Salazar his most recent license. Since then, he’s gotten two speeding tickets and has been in another collision, records show. 
“How can he keep driving?” said Gaudy Lemus, Ramirez’s mother. “We wanted consequences for him. Remove his driver’s license.” 
LA court officials belatedly reported the manslaughter conviction to the DMV last month, after CalMatters discovered the failure and asked about the case. It was only then that the state sent Salazar a notice revoking his driving privileges, records show.

CalMatters uncovered the error and others like it by cross-checking convictions in vehicular manslaughter cases against motorists’ DMV records, as part of an ongoing investigation. Earlier this year, we reported that the agency routinely allows drivers with horrifying histories of dangerous driving — including fatal crashes, DUIs and numerous tickets — to continue to operate on our roadways. 
But this isn’t just a DMV issue. Reporters identified about 400 cases from 2019 to 2024 in which the drivers’ convictions weren’t listed on their driving records, largely because the courts failed to report that information. The review wasn’t comprehensive; records were unavailable or incomplete in a number of counties.
In Los Angeles, about one-third of all convictions in manslaughter cases we identified were missing from drivers’ records. In Santa Clara County, it was half. We found no missing convictions in Orange County.
In response to our questions, 32 county courts so far have reported more than 275 missing convictions to the DMV. As a result, nearly 200 drivers who’ve killed have had their driving privileges suspended or revoked, updated DMV reports for these drivers show. While some already had a separate license suspension, 70 appear to have had a valid license before the agency took action in response to our reporting.
County courts, law enforcement and the DMV have a long history of poor communication that dates to the days of paper records. Today, court administrators blame the breakdowns on a mix of human error and technological bugs.

Chris Orrock, a spokesperson for the DMV, said the agency sends out revocation and suspension notices “as soon as we’re notified.” 
Even without a conviction, the DMV does have the discretion to strip a driver of their license for a fatal crash. We reported earlier this year that the agency often doesn’t use that power.
But in many cases, there is no discretion. State law, for example, requires the agency to revoke a driver’s license for at least three years after a felony vehicular manslaughter conviction.
As a result of the delayed reporting by the courts, some drivers could end up losing their licenses for far less than three years. That’s because the DMV typically enforces the sanction from the date of the conviction, not the date the court communicates it to the agency. 
Salazar’s current driving record shows him eligible to reapply for a license next spring — three years after his conviction but just a year after records show the state took action to revoke his driving privileges. 
His attorney declined to comment on his driving record but said Salazar did everything the court required.

For Lemus, the months after her son died in Salazar’s car were a blur. The loss was haunting, coming just as the teenager had decided to pursue a career building tiny homes for the homeless. 
She started having such bad panic attacks that she moved to a new city and switched jobs, unable to bear the drive to work through the intersection where the crash occurred. Her 25-year-old daughter still refuses to drive at all.
Lemus said she didn’t initially want Salazar to go to prison, “because it was an accident.” Now, she wonders whether that was a mistake. 
“I don’t want another family to go through whatever we went through,” Lemus said. 
A series of errors leads to reporting failures
State law has long required courts to report vehicle-related convictions to the DMV, including for speeding, DUI and vehicular manslaughter. The agency then puts the violations on a motorist’s driving record and, if necessary, suspends their license.
Last month, CalMatters reporters sent hundreds of names and case numbers to dozens of courts throughout the state and asked why convictions from vehicular manslaughter cases didn’t appear on drivers’ records. Most courts responded to questions quickly, thanked us for telling them, acknowledged the mistake and indicated that they would report the convictions to the DMV.
“They were errors on our part. I’m not going to sugarcoat it,” said Tara Leal, the court executive officer in Kern County, where we found 22 missing convictions.
In many counties, court staff simply neglected to send the information to the DMV.
Court clerks typically enter convictions into a case management system. Many courts use a system that has a tab for them to click on to transmit the information to the DMV.
Vehicle code violations like speeding tickets and DUIs clearly need to go to the DMV, court officials said. But most penal code violations, including offenses like robbery and assault, do not. Vehicular manslaughter is a penal code violation.
Heather Pugh, the Yuba County Superior Court executive officer, confirmed that her court should have reported conviction information to the DMV for eight cases CalMatters flagged. “To address that, we will reach out to the DMV to provide training to our staff on reporting requirements,” she said. “Additionally, we have instituted manual reviews of reportable non-vehicle code convictions to ensure they have been properly reported.”
Similarly, Fresno County’s director of court operations, Vidal Fernandez, acknowledged “the element of human error” in his court not reporting a half-dozen convictions in recent years. After realizing the problem, he said, staff checked further back, to 2015, identified an additional 17 cases and sent those convictions to the DMV as well.
Other counties have their computers essentially programmed to send conviction information to the DMV when clerks update the disposition information on a case, in theory taking human error out of the equation. But in response to questions from CalMatters, some administrators discovered that the programs were missing certain codes and had failed to function as intended.
“Ultimately it’s our responsibility,” said Jake Chatters, the court executive officer in Placer County, where a coding issue kept the court’s system from reporting two manslaughter cases.
In other courts, convictions were apparently reported, but there was some mistake in the information sent — like an incorrect birth date or a missing digit in a license number — and the DMV kicked the report back with an error message. Administrators said clerks are supposed to fix any errors and resubmit the information to the DMV, but in some cases that didn’t happen.
The result of the patchwork process is that even convictions from some of the most high-profile traffic deaths in recent years were missing from drivers’ records.
A deadly street race that grabbed international attention 
Ricardo Aguilar was racing his Dodge Challenger Hellcat in South Los Angeles one December afternoon in 2021, according to the Los Angeles Times, when he struck and killed a pedestrian — Arian Rahbar, a 21-year-old USC student and aspiring medical researcher.
Rahbar’s father, Sam, summarized the void left by his only child. “Without Arian, life as we know it has ceased to exist,” he told a judge.
The story made global headlines amid a spike in traffic deaths in Los Angeles and other California cities. Aguilar was convicted of felony vehicular manslaughter in 2023, court records show. But until a few weeks ago, that was never reflected in his state driving record.
In the section of his DMV report where collisions and traffic violations are supposed to show up, there was instead this message: “NONE TO REPORT.”
His driver’s license was still listed as valid.

It was only in May, after CalMatters asked the LA court for an explanation, that officials reported his and more than 100 other convictions to the DMV as required. Aguilar’s license is now listed as revoked. 
Aguilar’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.
Rahbar’s friend and former high school tennis teammate Ashwin Yedavalli was saddened and frustrated all over again to learn about the court error that allowed Rahbar’s killer to keep his license. 
Yedavalli, now 25, lives in Long Beach and still stops by the crash scene when he’s nearby. He helped organize a tennis tournament in his friend’s memory, and he said it’s unfair that the legal system failed to deliver on fundamental consequences for his death.
“It’s basically been brushed off,” Yedavalli said. “What about Arian’s life and legacy?”
A decades-long failure to communicate
This is not a new problem.
In the early 1990s, the California DMV was so concerned about getting timely and accurate reports from courts and law enforcement that it produced an educational video called “The Traffic Citation Trail.”
Frank Zolin, the agency’s director at the time, sat behind a desk wearing a crisp suit and chunky glasses, his silver hair swept to the side, to deliver the film’s key message: “We cannot achieve traffic safety without effective teamwork between local law enforcement, the courts and DMV.” 
The film goes on to tell the fictionalized story of a reckless young driver who is able to avoid a license suspension because a ticket wasn’t reported to the DMV. In an early scene, the young man rushes to the mailbox to intercept a letter from the agency before his parents can see it.
“They told me four tickets means bye-bye license. There’s only three tickets here,” the driver says in surprise as he reads a warning letter from the state. “The one I got more than a month ago isn’t even here. … It’s party time tonight.”
In a tragic, real-life twist, the actor who played the motorist was killed by a drunken driver more than a decade later. And communication continued to be an issue. 


Robert Bullock worked at the DMV for more than three decades. In that time, he said, drivers would sometimes come in wanting to know whether they could renew their license, despite a conviction.
“We’d pull up the record and it wasn’t there,” said Bullock, who retired in 2019. He said he would tell them, “The court has screwed up, and you kind of got a freebie.”
Technology has, of course, improved from the era of grainy ’90s videos. Back then, police drove boxy sedans and held walkie-talkies the size of bricks. DMV clerks picked through mounds of paper forms, copying information into clunky gray computers with white text on black screens.
Today, at courthouses equipped with online records and modern digital tools, some administrators said they’re upgrading to a new case management system that should ensure conviction reporting is automated. Others said they’re going to do more training and manual checks to make sure the information is sent to the DMV.
In Los Angeles — one of the nation’s biggest county court systems, where we sent a list of 150 convictions that appeared to be missing from driver records — administrators declined an interview request. Instead, they emailed a statement from Rob Oftring, the court’s chief communications and external affairs officer: 
“The Court continues to work expeditiously to identify ways to ensure the successful electronic transmittal of all abstract of judgments to the DMV from its case management systems. This includes additional manual checks to identify in advance technical issues that prevent an abstract from being sent to the DMV. This also includes ensuring all criminal courthouse locations timely process their queues for transmittal and additional mandatory training for court staff.”
A trail of disappointment
For someone like Angie Brey, who’s had to confront a system that often treats deadly crashes as accidents rather than crimes, the promises of change sound hollow.   
She lost her partner and the father of her son, Gregory Turnage, on Mother’s Day in 2021. That’s when wealth manager Timothy Hamano drove onto a sidewalk and hit the 41-year-old Turnage, according to records prosecutors filed in court. Hamano had been drinking beer on the golf course and a bloody mary at lunch in San Francisco before the crash, his wife later told police. 
Hamano pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter and hit-and-run early last year. He received virtually no time behind bars after getting credit for wearing an ankle monitor at home while the case was open. The conviction should have prompted the state to revoke Hamano’s license, but the Alameda County court didn’t report it.

“They essentially let him get away with murder, in our minds,” Brey said. “The fact that they didn’t even take away his license … is just mind-blowing.” 
A spokesperson, Paul Rosynsky, said the Alameda court reports hundreds of criminal convictions to the DMV every month, but he acknowledged that staff had missed sending two for manslaughter in recent years, including the Hamano case.
Hamano’s license appears to have been valid as recently as May 7, when DMV records show he got in another collision. (The records don’t detail who was at fault or the severity.) 
The agency sent Hamano a notice on May 28 that his driving privileges were revoked, following CalMatters’ inquiries.
Hamano’s attorney, Colin Cooper, said his client “is traumatized by what he did” and will never forgive himself. Hamano didn’t drive while the case was open and drove afterward only because he had a valid license and insurance, Cooper said. Hamano stopped driving after getting the revocation letter from the DMV, he said. 
Brey said holding drivers accountable for death is the least the state can do. She said she worries every day, when their son has to cross a busy intersection to get to school, that history will repeat itself.
“If somebody can come up on the sidewalk and kill my partner,” she said, “it just makes me really scared for my son.”

Gavin Newsom and the Legislature forgoes or delays many of Newsom’s proposed cuts but the deficit is only likely to grow.,"In summary
The budget deal between Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature forgoes or delays many of Newsom’s proposed cuts but the deficit is only likely to grow.


Gov. Gavin Newsom backed off some of his proposed cuts to health care programs in a state budget deal he reached with legislative leaders late Tuesday, but California will move forward with his plan to limit services to undocumented immigrants as the state faces a growing deficit.
The $321 billion spending plan is expected to go before the Legislature for approval later this week, ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year. With health care costs rising faster than expected, the state economy battered by new tariffs and further federal funding cuts looming, officials confronted a $12 billion shortfall that has forced difficult conversations about California’s spending.
Officials did not formally announce the deal as they continue to haggle over the details of a provision that could streamline construction of housing projects near public transit and denser development in cities. Newsom demanded the language, which has encountered resistance from the state Senate.
“We appreciate the strong partnership with the Legislature in reaching this budget agreement,” spokesperson Izzy Gardon said in a statement. “The Governor’s signature is contingent on finalizing legislation to cut red tape and unleash housing and infrastructure development across the state — to build more, faster.”
Though the Legislature already passed its own version of the budget earlier this month to meet a constitutional deadline, it relied more on borrowing and less on program cuts than Newsom, who sought to reverse course on recent major expansions of subsidized health care in order to stabilize California’s long-term finances.  
The budget agreement foregoes or delays many of his proposals. Legislative leaders argued against prematurely kicking people out of a vital safety net as they search for other solutions to address a persistent revenue gap that is projected to reach more than $20 billion annually in the coming years.
With officials ultimately agreeing to fewer spending reductions — reflecting a hope by many legislators that California’s economy will eventually rally — the state will pull about $7 billion out of its rainy-day fund and $6.5 billion from other cash reserves to balance the budget next year.
Nevertheless, the plan freezes enrollment by adults without legal status in Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for the poor, starting in January. After California finished gradually opening up the program to that population last year, more new patients enrolled than expected, contributing to about $6 billion in cost overruns that required an emergency appropriation to Medi-Cal this spring.
The budget deal also eliminates dental coverage for those who remain enrolled, starting in July 2026, and creates a $30 monthly premium for undocumented Medi-Cal patients between the ages of 19 and 59 that will take effect in July 2027.
But it rejects the governor’s proposed cuts to their long-term care benefits, as well to overtime pay for home health aides and funding for reproductive health providers, and does not reinstate a strict asset test that could have pushed thousands of newly eligible older and disabled Californians off of Medi-Cal again.

Public transit agencies and the University of California and California State University also avoid funding cuts under this spending plan, though some of the money for the university systems is deferred and they will be required to take out zero-interest loans from the state’s general fund in the meantime. The deal includes $45 million to help the struggling Sonoma State University, in Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire’s district, to turn around its financial woes. 
Housing, homelessness retain funding
The Legislature successfully pushed to keep $620 million in grants and loans for affordable housing construction and $500 million to support local homelessness services, and to add $100 million in one-time funding for counties to begin implementing Proposition 36. Local government and law enforcement agencies have argued they need far more help to enforce the measure, which was overwhelmingly approved by voters last fall to increase penalties and mandate treatment for certain drug crimes. Newsom remains opposed to that approach, which he contends would return California to an era of mass incarceration.
The budget deal maintains his proposal to close a fifth state prison by next October, which could save an estimated $150 million annually, and more than doubles the size of California’s film and television tax credit to $750 million, another gubernatorial priority as production flees the state.
The plan also relies on other internal fund shifts, including directing $1 billion raised from greenhouse gas polluters through cap-and-trade auctions to pay for firefighting and vegetation management projects. Some lawmakers had objected to using money intended to address climate change this way.
The fate of that cap-and-trade system, which Newsom had proposed to reauthorize through the budget, and his controversial push to fast-track the Delta tunnel are among several significant policy questions left unresolved in the agreement. They could still be addressed in follow-up budget bills in the coming weeks or through the regular legislative process by the end of the summer.
The governor also has yet to agree to a legislative proposal to lend up to $1.75 billion to local governments in Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area transit agencies dealing with their own budget crunches.
And all of this could be revisited again later this year or early next year as California warily eyes a major federal tax bill, still being negotiated in Congress, that could result in deep cuts to health care and food aid funding. Liberal state legislators and advocacy groups are turning up the pressure to raise state taxes to offset those losses, something Newsom has previously vehemently opposed.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/052325_Assembly-Floor_FG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-25 09:03:06.597141

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah comes in first in many civic-related rankings — it’s the top state for volunteerism, and its capital, Salt Lake City, has also been ranked among the “most patriotic cities.” However, there’s a list in which the state continues to lag behind its counterparts — voting and civic engagement among women.
While that number has been making its way up, it has also fluctuated in recent years, with the state ranking No. 29 out of 51 in the 2024 women’s turnout list, which also includes Washington, D.C., from Utah State University’s Utah Women & Leadership Project. The state’s performance is lower than last year, when it ranked 24 out of 51.
It’s however also a long way from the Utah Women & Leadership Project’s 2006 numbers, which placed the state in the 51st spot. 
The report painted a picture of Utah’s voting history, from the suffrage movement in the state’s early days including high Latter-day Saint support for votes for women with the idea that they would express support for polygamy, to Seraph Young, Brigham Young’s grand-niece, becoming the first woman to vote, to Utah women leading the nation in voter turnout in the late 20th century. But more recently, the state has fallen into the bottom voting participation spots nationwide.

“Women’s voting turnout and political participation have drastically improved since 2010, and Utah has more women serving in the state legislature than ever before,” the report’s authors wrote. “However, as Utah is still below national averages in terms of political representation and consistently ranks among the worst states for women’s equality.”
There are different factors that affect voting rates nationwide, including ethnicity, marital status and education levels — white women, married women and women with advanced degrees are most likely to vote, according to the study. 
“According to one report, inflation, including the rising cost of household expenses, was the most important issue for US women, followed by threats to democracy and immigration/border security,” according to the study. “An increased number of women ranked abortion as their most important issue, most likely due to the emphasis of reproductive rights in the Harris-Walz campaign.”
Utah women’s priorities in the 2024 elections were housing affordability, politicians listening to voters, inflation and government overreach, among others, according to the Utah Foundation. Women also tended to prioritize abortion and women’s rights while men ranked issues like crime and immigration higher up. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Utah women civically show up in other ways, however. They often express policy disagreements through boycotts, protests, contacting the press, and lobbying and interacting with politicians, according to the study. 
An example of those efforts were substantial in 2024, when the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government challenged Constitutional Amendment D, which ultimately led to the Utah Supreme Court voiding the amendment.
But, amid some wins, Utah women face challenges, “including the persistent lack of public support and funding for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence and for efforts that focus on the prevention of sexual assault, domestic violence, and child sexual abuse,” the study says.
Among other concerns affecting women in the state are also gender pay gaps, lack of child care, sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, gender-specific workforce development challenges, and elements of women’s health across the lifespan.
While voting rates have risen in the state, there’s still room for improvement, the authors said.
“Research shows that when young people participate in politics and their community, it shapes their future, and our communities benefit from their perspectives. Equally true, when women and men lead together, organizations, communities, individuals, and families benefit. By empowering more women to take active roles in their communities, we can create a more inclusive, equitable, and thriving Utah for generations to come.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)State judicial staff will conduct a review of fees imposed in Alabama’s court system to better understand the financial issues faced by people going through the legal system, following a meeting of the Court Cost Task Force on Tuesday.
Personnel will review the fees that courts in different jurisdictions charge litigants to access the courts, from civil matters like divorce to criminal charges including murder. The fees will then be compiled and broken into the different counties to get a sense of the financial disparities people face as they access various legal services from their court systems.
“I think we need to update a lot of our court cost studies,” said Alabama Chief Justice Sarah Hicks Stewart, the leader of the task force, in an interview following the task force’s meeting on Tuesday. “It was last updated in 2011, and we need to make sure that we have all the assessments and all the costs that the clerks were identifying, that those are all reflected appropriately in those charts.”
The task force is investigating court costs and the impact they have on the criminal justice system. It is tasked with researching possible avenues for generating money for a court system that has been chronically underfunded.
Staff plan to use the information to determine the amount of revenue the courts collect when adjudicating each case.
Much of Tuesday’s meeting focused on developing a more uniform fee system to potentially reduce the fee disparities people pay depending on the jurisdiction where they live.
“That is the goal, the charge that we have got on the commission,” Stewart said. “That is what we are really going to try and focus on.”
Othni Lathram, director of the Alabama Legislative Services Agency and a member of the task force, also outlined other priorities, including identifying the agencies and organizations that also receive funding from court costs; determining issues related to collection, increasing efficiency and workload for the clerks and backfilling lost funds.
Suzi Huffaker, legislative counsel for the Alabama State Bar Association, showed a spreadsheet of filing fees to indicate a study has been completed for different services charged, but the figures are dated from 2011 and that it is only from one county.
In theory, there should be less disparity in the number of fees levied by each judicial jurisdiction. During the task force’s first meeting in May, Stewart said that Section 96 of the Alabama Constitution is supposed to prohibit state lawmakers from selectively imposing fees on courts, commissions and public officials. But legislators can bypass that rule by enacting local acts with constitutional implications, leading to discrepancies in charges.
The goal of the investigation is to uncover all the court fees that counties impose as a first step toward uniformity.
“We do have an organized way of finding those fees, what they are, and updating those charts,” said Nathan Wilson, administrative director of courts. “What we would probably do is start with what we have, which is baseline 2011, and go back and look at the local acts that have passed since then, and any statewide acts that have passed since 2011, and just put those into the chart on a county-by-county basis.”
Steven L. Nicholas, an attorney based in Mobile, said the research must also identify the number of cases that relate to each of the fees.
“How much money do I have to generate to make it revenue neutral?” he asked. “I need to know how much money is collected so I know what I have to come up with. For each county, you need to know how many times that fee was charged.”
Wilson said that is possible to calculate with the information contained in the system.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250624_110807-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-25 09:03:06.597141

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development has opened public comment on a proposal that would reduce municipal governments’ ability to assist local public schools.
The draft regulation, published Friday, would state that services — such as parking-lot plowing, or the use of public pools or libraries for school functions — would count toward the maximum limit of local aid that school districts may receive from the local government.
The education department said it proposed the regulation change as a way to avoid failing the “disparity test,” which governs the financial spread between the richest and poorest school districts in the state.
That test is required by the U.S. Department of Education because of the way Alaska allocates some federal financial aid.
Local governments, school districts and public-school advocates have vocally opposed the change, and when the state education department asked the state school board to adopt the regulation on an immediate, emergency basis, it prompted a loud outcry that caused the school board to postpone acting on that request.
Now, the board is not scheduled to consider the regulation until at least October, according to a public notice accompanying the draft regulation.
Public comments are being accepted at eed.stateboard@alaska.gov through 5 p.m., July 23.

Four years later, he started his one-man March Against Fear across the state, only to be shot by a white supremacist.

,California,2025-06-25 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s war on carbon emissions faces setbacks in court and Congress,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-zero-emissions-vehicles-war/,"New laws, a future Supreme Court decision and consumer hesitance are some of the obstacles California must overcome if it's going to see a carbon neutral future.","California’s self-designated deadline for achieving net zero emissions of greenhouse gases is 20 years away. But what is happening — or not happening — in multiple arenas now may determine whether that goal is met.
The largest single source of emissions is the nearly 1 billion miles that Californians drive each day. Accordingly the state has ordered that by 2035, all new cars sold must be zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). However, the state has interim goals and, so far, purchases of  electric vehicles are falling well short.
This year’s goal was to be 35%, but sales have been running about 10 percentage points behind, compelling the Air Resources Board to push the 2026 goal of 43% off until 2027.
Meanwhile the Republican-controlled Congress, in response to pleas from automakers, has passed and President Donald Trump has signed legislation to cancel the state’s authority to deviate from national emission standards, effectively halting the zero-emission mandate.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate,” Trump said. “And they’re never coming back.”
The state is challenging the new legislation in court, leaving the issue up in the air. However, even if the state’s waiver from federal standards is reinstated, the underlying issue of persuading Californians to buy electric vehicles would remain.
“To meet the revised 2027 target, California would need to increase ZEV sales by about 50% from current levels — rising from approximately 23% today to 43% in less than 24 months,” Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, notes in a recent analysis of the situation.
Obviously, the state cannot directly force motorists to buy electric cars and trucks and can only offer subsidies or make it impossible to purchase anything other than a zero-emission vehicle. On paper, the legal onus is on automakers to meet the year-by-year goals, with hefty fines — thousands of dollars per vehicle — for falling short.
Another major front in the carbon war is the Air Resources Board’s “low carbon fuel standard” aimed at compelling refineries to lower the amount of carbon in gasoline.
While the board wanted it to take effect earlier this year, its regulations hit a snag in the Office of Administrative Law, which declared the regulations lacked the “clarity” needed to make them understood by those affected. The air board has rewritten some passages of the regulations, which are hundreds of pages long, and has indicated that they may take effect in July. 
The big issue, at least to motorists, is how they will affect pump prices.
In 2023, the board estimated that adoption could immediately increase gas prices by 47 cents a gallon, and then “on average, from 2031 through 2046 the proposed amendments are projected to potentially increase the price of gasoline by $1.15 per gallon, the price of diesel by $1.50 per gallon and fossil jet fuel by $1.21 per gallon.”
The estimate generated a storm of media attention, and the board responded by refusing to put firm numbers on potential price effects, thus creating a guessing game that will end only when the mandate takes effect.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court declared last week that oil companies have the right to challenge the state’s emission regulations in court.
“The whole point of the regulations is to increase the number of electric vehicles in the new automobile market beyond what consumers would otherwise demand,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion.
“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court.”
The 7-2 decision implies that whatever else happens, the Supreme Court could have the last word, and it might not favor California.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/091520_Traffic-Highway-Freeway-Brentwood-AW-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-25 08:03:30.138174
,Mississippi Today,2025-06-25 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Will Warren’s story: From 10th grade bench warmer to NY Yankees starter,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/25/will-warren-yankees/,Column: Mississippi native and New York Yankees pitcher Will Warren's incredible story is one of waiting your turn and never giving up.,"Take a look at the photo above. The guy about to deliver the pitch is Will Warren, the New York Yankees star rookie pitcher. Warren stands a strapping 6 feet, 2 inches tall, weighs a streamlined 200 pounds and can throw 97 mph fastballs that move this way and that with pinpoint accuracy.

Will Warren, left, couldn’t get on the mound as a skinny, 5-foot, 4-inch Jackson Prep 10th grader.
Now then, look at the photo to the right from 10 years ago. The kid wearing number 16 is the same Will Warren, then 16 years young and a 10th grader at Jackson Prep. Warren stood 5 feet, 4 inches tall, threw his fastball 78 mph and pitched all of three innings in Prep’s state championship season. Says Warren, “I was a skinny, little guy, and we had a bunch of really talented older guys who could really throw it hard. I wasn’t big enough or good enough. I hardly ever got to play.”
Perhaps this column should be required reading for all the late bloomers in baseball — or any sport, for that matter — who ride the bench while wondering if they are ever going to grow or mature enough to even get a chance. This is a story of waiting your turn and never giving up. This is the story of a kid who at one point couldn’t get on the mound at Jackson Prep’s cozy field on Lakeland Drive and now often takes the mound in pinstripes at mammoth Yankee Stadium in the Bronx before a packed house and national TV audience.
This is the story of a kid who grew nearly nine inches taller his junior year of high school and who still wasn’t considered good enough to be recruited by the big baseball schools in his home state. So he took the only scholarship offer he had at Southeastern Louisiana, worked his butt off and continued to grow, get stronger and learn how to pitch. This is also the story of a guy who, if he continues on his current career path, will someday make millions upon millions of dollars playing the game he was once considered too small and weak to play.
“I grew up a Mississippi State fan, and my dream was to play baseball there,” Warren said on Monday by phone from Cincinnati, where the Yankees are currently playing. “By the time I was really pitching well as a senior at Prep, they already had all their pitchers committed.”
So did Ole Miss. So did Southern Miss. So did all the other SEC and Deep South baseball powers. Southeastern Louisiana, a really good, under-appreciated baseball program, kept showing up at all Prep games, kept telling Warren he was their guy. Finally, Warren committed to Southeastern in Hammond, just two hours away from home. Says Warren, “It was where I was supposed to be.”
He wasn’t an overnight success at SLU either. He pitched only 23 innings as a freshman and had a 1-1 record with three saves (one a three-inning save in a victory over LSU at Baton Rouge, which served a predictor of things to come).
“At Southeastern I got in the weight room really hard for the first time that freshman year and got a lot stronger,” Warren said.
By the time he was a senior, his fastball velocity had zoomed to a consistent 95 mph, sometimes touching 97. He had polished his off-speed and breaking pitches. Most importantly, he threw strikes, as his 95 strikeouts compared to 25 walks attest.
The Yankees, who had shown interest and offered him a free agent contract the year before, drafted him in the eighth round of the 2021 draft. He quickly became one of the franchise’s top prospects. His rise up the Yanks’ minor league ladder was relatively quick: Class A and AA in 2022, AA and AAA in 2023, AAA and a taste of the Major Leagues in 2024.
That first taste of the Big Leagues was more bitter than sweet. He allowed 33 hits and 26 earned runs in just 22.2 innings. 
“I just wasn’t comfortable and was trying to do too much, be too perfect at first,” Warren said.
But then again, nothing has ever come easy for Warren. That said, injuries to two projected starters this past spring opened spots in the Yankees’ starting rotation. Warren pitched well enough in the spring to earn one of them. And, after a relatively slow start to the regular season, he keeps getting better and better. The Yankees have won seven of his last nine starts, and he has pitched at least five innings in all but one. His record stands at 4-4 and opponents are batting only .239 against him. If he continues to progress at his current pace, he will be a candidate for American League Rookie of the Year.
“Experience helps, and I keep learning and improving,” Warren said. “I know I have what it takes. I’m in a good spot with a really good team.”
The Yankees lead the American League East by two games over the surging Tampa Bay Rays, who have been boosted this season Warren’s former Jackson Prep teammate Jake Mangum. The two faced one another May 5 in a game at Tampa Bay. Warren chuckled as he told the story. 
“I got a two strike count on him and threw him a really good slider down and away,” Warren said. “So of course Jake went down and got it, hit a high bouncer that he beat out for a hit — just Jake doing what Jake does. I glanced over at him and gave him a look and he tipped his cap and smiled. It was a moment.”
Mangum, the all-time SEC hits leader at State, was a senior star at Prep when Warren was a skinny, little 10th grader riding the bench, worrying if he would ever grow. Warren was so concerned about his size his parents took him to a pediatrician, who measured (via X-rays) Will’s growth plates. “You’re gonna grow,” the doctor told him. “Your growth plates are wide open. You’re gonna be a late bloomer, son, but you are going to grow.”
And grow he did, more rapidly than he could ever have imagined.
“I always thought Will would be a really good pitcher if he grew, and he did,” Mangum said. “He always had that pitch-ability. He could hit his spots and knew when to throw what pitches. He knew how to pitch. Plus, he just worked so hard at it. I am so happy for Will and what he has accomplished. When he’s not playing us, I pull for him.”
Warren always has believed in himself.
“I’ve always told people I wanted to play in the Big Leagues,” he said. “I definitely believed that I had the ability to take the next step at every level I’ve played. I think you have to have that confidence, that edge. I’ve always tried to be the best I can be at every level. At the same time, every day I am so grateful and feel so blessed to do what I do. It does feel like a dream sometimes. I’m so thankful that God has blessed me with this opportunity.”

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Alabama environmental regulators have agreed to update standards used to limit the amounts of 12 toxic and carcinogenic substances in the state’s waterways, a move that clean water advocates say will help protect those who fish and swim in Alabama’s rivers.
Seven Alabama environmental groups petitioned the state’s Environmental Management Commission to update those standards in April, and that petition was approved at the June 13 commission meeting.
The commission, a seven-member appointed board that oversees the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, ruled in favor of the environmental groups by a 6-1 vote, despite ADEM’s objections.

The decision was a rare win for environmental groups operating in the deep-red state, from a board that rarely votes against the department’s recommendations.
“We’re pleased but somewhat surprised, given the historical reluctance to give environmentalists what they want,” David Ludder, an attorney representing the environmental groups, said in an interview.
Ludder said that, once finalized, the new standards will result in stricter limits on how much of these toxic substances can legally be discharged into Alabama waterways that are sources of drinking water and popular fishing areas across much of the state.
In their petition, the groups noted that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published new Integrated Risk Information System [IRIS] standards in 2015, but the state had never updated its thresholds to match. The IRIS program assesses the latest scientific research on numerous hazardous chemicals to help federal, state and local regulators determine safety standards for exposure.
“EPA did a very large reevaluation of toxic pollutants in 2015 and it was our hope that ADEM would promptly respond to that 2015 evaluation,” Ludder said. “Since then, every three years, we’ve asked ADEM to do that, to complete that evaluation, and they never were able to do it, and they never were able to provide a specific time limit for doing it.”

(Via Inside Climate News)
Ludder said commission rules require ADEM to use EPA-issued water standards “except where other values are established” in coordination with the Alabama Department of Public Health. That did not happen in this case.
“If you want to set aside the value of the Integrated Risk Information System, you have to develop a justification for something else,” Ludder said at the commission meeting. “And that has to be done in consultation with the Department of Public Health.”
ADEM acting director Jeffery Kitchens told the commission that the petition should be denied because it was “premature,” arguing that ADEM needed more time to evaluate the standards, and that the department was working on the water toxicity standards as a whole instead of keying in on 12 individual contaminants identified in the petition.
Kitchens said the department was moving on a timeline to propose an update to the standards by “late 2026,” aligning with ADEM’s policy of reviewing the guidelines every three years.
“We believe this comprehensive evaluation will result in the adoption of protective, scientifically justifiable criteria,” Kitchens said during the meeting.
Ludder countered that Kitchens’ response did not establish any firm deadlines for updating the standards and that multiple triennial reviews had taken place since 2015 without reflecting the new EPA guidance.
“The petition process is recognized by Alabama law, and it’s designed specifically to move agencies to do something, to reconsider what their rules say,” Ludder said during the meeting. “We’re asking you to do that and not defer to another triennial review.”
The commission—composed of private-sector experts in law, biology, engineering, medicine, geology and veterinary medicine, appointed by the governor—found the argument compelling.
“If our rules say we should be following [the EPA standard], we should be following it until we have a scientific basis to do something different,” Commissioner Lanier Brown, a Birmingham-based attorney, said during the meeting. “And we don’t have something different, so we’ve got to follow those.”
The commission sided with the petitioners, with only commission Chair Frank McFadden voting no.
Ludder filed the petition on behalf of seven Alabama environmental groups: the Alabama Rivers Alliance, Black Warrior Riverkeeper, Cahaba Riverkeeper, Choctawhatchee Riverkeeper, Coosa Riverkeeper, Mobile Baykeeper and the Environmental Defense Alliance.
Charles Miller, policy director for the Alabama Rivers Alliance, said he was encouraged not only by the vote, but by the level of discussion among commissioners, ADEM and the petitioners.
“There were a lot of good questions from the commissioners,” Miller said. “I think this is an example of what happens when we put some thought into our environmental regulations, when we take them seriously.”
ADEM will now be required to update its standards for 12 chemical pollutants. For five of those toxicants—cyanide, 1,3-dichlorobenzene, 4,6-dinitro-2-methylphenol, ethyl benzene, and toluene—the state will switch to the updated EPA standard for an oral reference dose, mirroring the EPA’s IRIS reference dose thresholds.
A reference dose is the amount of a toxic substance that a person can be exposed to on a daily basis that is “likely to be without an appreciable risk” of harm. The EPA uses this metric to evaluate potentially harmful chemicals that are not considered carcinogens.
For six other compounds—1,3- dichloropropylene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, hexachloroethane, pentachlorophenol, trichloroethylene and arsenic—the state will use the EPA’s updated cancer potency factor. The CPF estimates how much ingesting 1 mg per day of a certain chemical will increase a person’s risk of developing cancer.
For 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, the petition requested the state shift from using the reference dose threshold to the cancer potency factor threshold.
According to the petition, the updated standards are the result of new research and analysis by the EPA showing the chemicals are harmful at lower concentrations than previously believed.
“While the toxicity values for the toxic pollutants … may have reflected the best science and scientific judgment available at the time of their adoption by the Commission, new information and scientific methods have become available which demonstrate that the toxicity values for the above-mentioned priority toxic pollutants are not sufficient to protect human health,” the petition states. “The proposed amendment will revise those toxicity values to reflect the best available science and scientific judgment and protect human health.”
Ludder said he expects the department to formally propose the updated standards around December, with the new limits incorporated into permits and advisories after that.
“The toxicity value of these chemicals is not the only consideration in establishing what level of water quality will be achieved, but it will definitely improve things,” Ludder said. “It will reduce the amount of toxins in Alabama waters.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cahaba-River-for-June-24-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 08:03:30.138174

(Getty Images)State politicians are like self-appointed lifeguards that lack the ability to swim, yelling directions to someone drowning, from the shore. Lacking knowledge about education or experience in the field, they mandate senseless policies and practices that do not improve student outcomes. 
Nevada’s newest attempt at “education reform,” Senate Bill 460 was recently enrolled by the state legislature and signed by Gov. Joe Lombardo. It combined two competing bills: one from the governor and one from Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro. The result is a complete bipartisan mess.
Who or what (AI?) created this monstrosity? It is difficult to consume its 200+ pages even for those familiar and experienced with reading educational studies and legalese. Trust me on that one.
The opening paragraph alone contains a laundry list of ineffective remedies, most of which have failed in other states. The biggest flaw (among many) in this law is promoting the false premise that standardized test score averages effectively measure accountability in education.
Possible positives buried in SB460 are support for pre-kindergarten / early childhood education programs that may help students enter kindergarten on a more level playing field and limiting teacher liability when intervening in physical altercations.
There are no proven educational practices that have ever closed academic achievement gaps or  produced common levels of literacy. Not the interventions, remediations, strategies, or methods included in this law.
There are no effective models of instruction in other states (especially those with 3rd grade retention policies). Phony claims of success made by states, districts or schools are based on flawed statistics and outright lies. There is no “science of reading” or “miracle” in another state that closes literacy gaps.
The mandatory elementary school plans, strategic plans, Educational Service Center, Public Oversight Board, Commissions for Innovation, Funding, Recruitment and Professional Standards, or requirements for hiring a superintendent will not improve state test score averages.
Threatening “low-performing” schools with state takeovers, withholding funding or removing principals has never worked in any other state. The new definition of “low performing” includes schools with state test score averages in the bottom 20th percentile or where less than 50% of 3rd graders are proficient readers. Currently, this describes about half the schools in Nevada.
Oversight, accountability and evaluation of schools, administrators and teachers are pointless if measured by standardized test score averages. Differences in instruction or educational practice do not account for individual differences in standardized test scores. Test score averages should not be tied to school performance or evaluations of teachers and principals.
State and national standardized tests are designed to create a normal distribution (bell curve) of individual scores. The bulk of scores fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles. Proficiency levels are preset; meaning that the number of students that can achieve proficiency is predetermined. It is a rigged game.
Standardized tests rank individual students in relation to their peers. Individual test score ranks are used to sort and label students at all levels of education. State tests were never designed to measure school success or evaluate the effectiveness of teachers and administrators.
Nevada uses the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) as its state-mandated test of academic achievement in grades 3-8; along with about a dozen other states. SBAC consistently delivers a rank of percentile scores for individual students as do other state standardized tests.
The SBAC, like other standardized tests, is not a learning tool. Tests cover a very broad range of material with strict time parameters to comprehend and process test questions.
Students take this once a year battery of tests, are not allowed to see which test items were correct or incorrect, receive results weeks or months later with a raw score, percentile and label. There is no feedback to students which is crucial for learning. There is no opportunity to correct or learn from mistakes.
The preset proficiency level for 3rd grade reading on the SBAC is about the 55th percentile. That guarantees the failure of more than half of 3rd graders as only 45% are allowed to be labeled as proficient readers.
Demographics are the major determinant of test score averages. Higher poverty levels, lower parent education levels, more English learner students ensure that Nevada will remain near the bottom when compared to other states.
Superintendents across Nevada public school districts have grown weary of senseless mandates from the state; usually directed toward curing the perceived educational ills in Clark County. The directives have not improved student outcomes in CCSD or other districts across the state.
If the primary concern is the size of CCSD, then break it up. Create independent districts in Clark County. Start with the borders of the City of Henderson.
Few can comprehend the educational mess created by SB460, certainly not its creators. If oddsmakers set the over/under at 1 for the number of members in the Nevada State Legislature and governor’s office that have read the entire content of this pointless law, bet the under.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/testing-1024x665.jpeg,,,2025-06-25 08:03:30.138174

Mikie Sherill (D) called Jack Ciattarelli (R) a ""Trump lackey"" who will curtail abortion rights in New Jersey if elected governor. Ciattarelli called Sherrill wrong and dishonest. (Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, used the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision overturning the federal right to abortion Tuesday to attack Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli and warn voters that he would “take away rights from women across the state.”
With President Donald Trump further restricting reproductive rights in his second term, abortion is an issue that could motivate voters in New Jersey’s gubernatorial race, political observers say — if the candidates frame it the right way.
Alyssa Maurice, research director at Stockton University’s William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy, said Sherrill’s potential focus on abortion in her campaign to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy in January could be successful if she pins down Ciattarelli as being anti-abortion rights and the state’s Republicans try to avoid the topic.
But that could be a struggle for Sherrill, Maurice said.
“The challenge they’re going to face is that they have to fight against a sort of apathy on this issue for New Jersey voters in particular, because New Jersey voters sort of feel immune to some of the federal changes because they feel like abortion is safe here,” said Maurice.
Sherrill, speaking to reporters Tuesday, painted her Republican opponent as a “Trump lackey” and a threat to the rights she said she’s fought to protect during her time in Congress. Sherrill supports adding abortion rights to the state’s constitution.
“Jack opposed allowing women to receive 12 months of contraception coverage. He supported Chris Christie’s budgets that defunded Planned Parenthood. He said as governor he would defund Planned Parenthood, and he said he would sign an abortion ban,” Sherrill said. “So, with one stroke of a pen, Jack could begin to take away the freedom we know and love right here in New Jersey.”
Sherrill, who was endorsed Tuesday by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey, also warned that Ciattarelli intends to elect far-right members to the state Supreme Court, where they could upend reproductive rights in the Garden State.
When Ciattarelli ran for governor in 2021, he said he would sign a bill protecting abortion rights if the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade (that decision came the following year). He also says getting an abortion should be a decision that’s between a woman, her family, her doctors, and her faith, with some “reasonable” exceptions and restrictions.
Ciattarelli could not be reached to comment Tuesday. On social media, he criticized Sherrill’s comments as “wrong (and predictably dishonest) again.”
“My pro-choice position on abortion up to 20 weeks has been clear and consistent. I encourage anyone to go read my website,” he said.
Ciattarelli said his appointees to the state Supreme Court would be focused on “the disastrous school funding formula and mandated ‘affordable’ housing.”
Maurice said Ciattarelli’s move to shift the focus from abortion is one that will likely play out during the general election. She noted he has a “more difficult challenge ahead when it comes to this issue.”
In October, a Stockton University poll found a majority of New Jersey voters (73%) said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 1 in 5 said it should be illegal in most or all cases. It also said, one month before last year’s presidential race, that 73% of voters said a candidate’s views on abortion would impact their vote. Maurice noted those results are consistent with polling from previous years and consistent across gender and political affiliation.
Though Democrat Kamala Harris won New Jersey in 2024, abortion was not enough of a driver for Democrats to prevent Trump’s reelection. The strategy on the Democratic side this time, Maurice said, could be to tie abortion to kitchen table issues that took the forefront in the 2024 presidential election, like the economy and the rising cost of living.
“We’ll probably see that as a strategy as well to be able to relate this to independents who are not as energized by abortion on its own,” she said.
State Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex), during Sherrill’s call with reporters Tuesday, emphasized the potential consequences of electing a Republican governor in New Jersey, given that the GOP controls Congress and the White House.
“How much greater than to have a woman who understands that we are capable of making our own decisions with our own medical professionals in a private setting, without the threat of having a constitution that eliminates that right for us,” Ruiz said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Will Solomon: A response to the commentary from the Shalom Alliance.","Dear Editor,


In response to the commentary from the Shalom Alliance: “Vermont legislators have a chance to save Jewish lives — now”:
The Shalom Alliance’s mild-mannered self-description as a “a nonpartisan nonprofit working to build a bright future for Vermont Jews by fighting antisemitism and misinformation in Vermont schools, communities and media” belies several key facts.
First, the group lobbied aggressively against apartheid-free designations passed in five Vermont communities earlier this year by Vermonters who have been rightfully horrified seeing American political support and weapons aid in a massacre of tens of thousands of people in Gaza, and enforce what Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and countless other organizations define as apartheid in Palestine generally.
Second, the bill Shalom Alliance endorses, H.310, would not merely create Holocaust education standards in Vermont (a perfectly legitimate aim), but would define “negative references to … the right to self-determination in the Jewish people’s ancestral and indigenous homeland” — in other words, anti-Zionism — as “antisemitic harassment,” itself a dangerous and offensive conflation and an explicit threat to freedom of speech.
Third, the group’s incorporator, Mitchell Knisbacher, has donated via the Sandra and Mitchell Knisbacher Foundation to extremist Israeli organizations, including the Central Fund of Israel and the One Israel Fund, which support settlement activities in Palestine.
Despite what the anonymous editorial writers say, their views are extreme and probably anathema to most Vermonters. Voters and legislators should carefully read and reject H.310.

Medicaid is especially important for children and families in rural areas where access to hospitals or doctor’s offices can be difficult.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Julie Ehrlich: Cuts to Medicaid means cuts to children’s health care.","This commentary is by Julie Ehrlich, MD, of Burlington, a pediatric resident physician at the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital and a member of the Vermont Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.


The U.S. Senate is set to vote on its budget reconciliation legislation in the coming weeks, threatening to decrease Medicaid funding even more than the already alarming proposed cuts by the House-passed budget known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The budget cuts would result in millions of Americans losing their health care coverage and thousands of preventable deaths annually, according to a new analysis published in Annals of Internal Medicine.
Vermont pediatricians are deeply concerned about proposed cuts to Medicaid by the federal government. Why? Because the people and places in our region that care for children rely on Medicaid to provide needed services and to keep their doors open. Significant cuts to Medicaid will impact all children and the pediatric health professionals who care for them.
As a pediatrician in training, I have come to understand the importance of Medicaid for the children and families I care for. I worry that cuts to needed pediatric care will threaten the future of child health in Vermont.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health coverage for our “most vulnerable,” but who exactly is that? Many people assume it is only for those with low incomes, those with disabilities and special needs, but what is often forgotten are the children.
Medicaid is the largest source of children’s health care coverage in the U.S. Our very own “Dr. Dynasaur,” Vermont’s Medicaid program for children and pregnant women, provides health care access to 48% of Vermont children.
Medicaid is especially important for children and families in rural areas where access to hospitals or doctor’s offices can be difficult. Medicaid provides school-based care, like on-site nurses or physicians, mental health professionals and other telehealth care.
Medicaid also covers preventative care for children like immunizations, well-child checkups, mental health services and vision and dental which keeps our kids healthy and in school. Cuts to Medicaid would be a disservice to every child and would have terrible and costly consequences for years to come.
Additionally, children’s hospitals depend heavily on Medicaid, as high as 50-80% of their inpatient days are reimbursed by Medicaid. Cuts to Medicaid funding will mean cuts to available pediatric inpatient beds across the country, a trend we are already seeing with the closure of children’s hospitals nationally and regionally, including Tufts Children’s Hospital in 2022.
Limited inpatient pediatric capacity will stress our region for all children, even those on private insurance. This is an even scarier thought in Vermont where we only have one children’s hospital and a very limited number of pediatric inpatient and intensive care beds.
The new budget cuts proposed by the Senate relies heavily on reducing Medicaid income eligibility, increasing work requirements and limiting exemptions. Not only will many children lose their health insurance, millions of caregivers across the United States will lose their health care coverage, threatening the health and safety of our children.
Research shows that having even one uninsured family member is associated with worse health outcomes for caregivers and their children. The new budget proposal also includes limiting exemptions for caregivers to individuals with dependent children 14 years or younger leaving caregivers of older children without funds to care for them.
Our delegates, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Peter Welch and Rep. Becca Balint are fighting for our children in their action against cuts to Medicaid. But they can’t do it without your support.
The Senate is currently considering the largest cuts to federal health care programs in the history of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, and they plan to act by July 4. This is an opportunity for you to lend your voice in a moment that matters. Contact Sen. Sanders and Sen. Welch with your stories. Give them the ammunition they need to fight for your health care and the health care of your children.

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.


Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)I went up to the ICU to check on a patient and I saw Sarah, a seasoned nurse I’ve worked with for years, juggling six critical patients. Her eyes were tired, her steps hurried, but she still managed a reassuring smile for a frightened family. Between checking IV lines and updating charts, she whispered to me, “I’m drowning, but I can’t let anyone see it.” That moment hit me hard. Sarah’s dedication keeps our hospital running, but the strain of understaffing is breaking her and countless nurses like her across Indiana.
A mother waits hours in an ER for her child’s care. A patient faces delays for surgery. Nurses, the backbone of our health care system, are stretched to the limit. They manage unsafe patient loads, earn modest wages, and live with the fear that one missed sign or delayed response could cost a life. Many are afraid to speak up, silenced by the risk of retaliation. This is a test of Indiana’s political, institutional, and moral priorities. Gov. Mike Braun and hospital leaders need to restore trust among our nurses.
The numbers paint a grim picture. Indiana hospitals face a 10 to 15% nurse vacancy rate and must train 1,300 additional nurses annually through 2031 just to keep up. Meanwhile, burnout is accelerating. A 2024 survey found that 15% of Indiana nurses plan to leave the profession, citing pay and workload as top concerns. During Nurses Week 2025, frontline caregivers shared stories of chronic understaffing, mental fatigue, and a health care culture that treats exhaustion as routine. The pandemic did not cause this. It revealed how fragile the system already was.
Indiana has a problem: a lack of nurses. And lawmakers are trying to help.

Leadership has failed to meet the moment. Braun’s 2025 budget allocated nothing to address this issue. Instead, it prioritized tax cuts and tighter Medicaid eligibility. It’s unclear if policymakers even recognize the crisis for what it is. If they do, they are certainly not treating it like one. His signing of House Bill 1004, which requires nonprofit hospitals to reduce pricing by 2029 or risk losing tax-exempt status, was a modest step on pricing but does nothing for workforce stability. No mandate for better pay. No investment in training. No plan for retention.
At the same time, the legislature has capped nursing program capacity, bottlenecking the pipeline. Hospital boards continue approving massive executive salaries. IU Health’s CEO earned millions while frontline nurses juggle impossible workloads with stagnant pay. IU Health holds $8.5 billion in assets and is building a $4.3 billion campus, yet its staff face critical shortages. A 2023 study directly linked inadequate nurse staffing to higher mortality rates, longer hospital stays, and millions in preventable costs. This amounts to institutional neglect.
We in Indiana are already paying the price in patient outcomes and a deteriorating standard of care. Strategic investment is essential to safeguard care and retain talent. People expect their hospital to be staffed and safe. Indiana’s leaders must listen to the people who keep the system running and act accordingly.
Here is how Indiana can begin to change things:
Tie Medicaid funding to safe, patient-centered staffing and fair compensation.
Hospitals receiving public funds should commit to care models grounded in safety, not cost cutting. That means fair pay for nurses with regular cost-of-living increases and staffing models that reflect patient needs. Keeping nurses in the profession protects both patients and the system.
Cap executive bonuses at nonprofit hospitals that fail to support their workforce.
Systems like IU Health, Community Health, and Ascension must lead by aligning leadership rewards with staff and patient outcomes not just financial performance.
Invest in nursing education and retention.
Raise faculty pay. Expand loan forgiveness. Fully fund a nurse residency program to grow the workforce and retain new graduates in high-need areas.
Protect nurses who speak out.
Enact strong whistleblower protections so nurses can report unsafe conditions without risking their careers.
These actions are necessary, evidence-based, and fiscally responsible. Better staffing means fewer errors and healthier communities. When nurses are supported, patients thrive and the entire system becomes more stable.
We cannot afford to keep building hospitals while ignoring the people who make health care possible. Braun and hospital leaders must protect the workforce now. Because without nurses there is no health care. And without action there soon won’t be enough left to care.

Mumford football stadium in Baton Rouge after it was granted $1.27 million for the lights from the Louisiana PSC’s Public Entities program. (John Oubre / Southern University)When a lighting contractor approached the Iberia Parish School District in Louisiana and offered it no-strings attached money for energy efficiency upgrades, Harry Lopez, manager of maintenance for the district said, “Flags went up, of course.”
Lopez had a reason to be cautious. Advocates and contractors alike say there isn’t a single program in the country that offers free money for efficiency upgrades to schools or other public buildings — except in Louisiana. 
After learning the too-good-to-be-true offer was real, Lopez signed up. To date, contractors have installed energy-saving LED lights in more than a dozen schools in the Iberia Parish district at a cost of $2 million, paid for by Louisiana’s residential and commercial electric customers through their monthly power bills. 
The free money came from the Louisiana Public Service Commission’s “public entities” program run by each of the five commission members within their respective districts. 
The program is funded by half of the money collected from the monthly energy efficiency fee charged to ratepayers of the state’s largest utilities. The other half is used by the utilities for their own energy efficiency programs. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Each of the elected commissioners receives $2.2 million to $3.8 million per year to allocate to schools, municipalities, parks and other public entities in their districts for energy efficiency projects. Since the program began in 2017, the commissioners have awarded about $80 million, mostly on lighting and some for upgrades to heating and cooling systems.
The commissioners’ program is intended to cost-effectively reduce energy consumption — a strategy that can lower utility bills and benefit the planet through reduced fossil fuel emissions. In many cases, it accomplishes those goals. 
But with few rules, almost no competitive bidding, an opaque selection process and no independent audits, it is also a wasteful “patronage” system, according to one energy watchdog. 
Even some commissioners question the lack of safeguards around the program. But largely they praise it, saying it benefits everyone in the state by lowering power bills for government facilities.
“The concept that it’s improper or corrupt, or any other adjective you want to assign to the public entity program, I think is just incorrect,“ Republican Commissioner Eric Skrmetta said. 
Democratic Commissioner Davante Lewis has a different view, calling the program, “literally … a slush fund with no checks and balances on commissioners to dole out cash that is collected from every ratepayer.”
  Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta secured $400,000 in utility ratepayer funds to provide energy-efficient lighting at two Northshore Technical Community College campuses. The projects were part of a program that allows commissioners to choose local government buildings for fully funded energy efficiency retrofits paid by ratepayers. (Northshore Technical Community College Facebook page)
Commission kills plan for independent program
In April, the commission on a 3-2 partisan vote killed a long-debated statewide energy efficiency program to be run by an independent third party after Republican commissioners argued the administrative cost for that program was too high.
Some commissioners boast their program only costs 1-2% of its budget to administer. But Lewis and his staff found the true administrative costs paid to contractors are between 30% and 35%. 
An analysis conducted by a commission consultant and shared by Lewis shows that by one metric, the commission’s program was nearly twice as expensive as the program commissioners rejected. That analysis said the commissioners’ program costs nearly 5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy saved, compared to the proposed third-party program, which would have cost 2.8 cents per kWh saved. 
Daniel Tait, a researcher with the watchdog Energy and Policy Institute who has investigated Louisiana’s public entities program, pointed to what he sees as hypocrisy in rejecting the independently administered program. 
“(The commissioners) want to yell about how energy efficiency is not a good investment,” Tait said. “Then they go over here to this public entities program, and they are wasting dollars left and right on ineffective energy efficiency programs.”
Consumer advocate Logan Atkinson Burke says the commissioners’ program does not directly help the people who need it the most in one of the nation’s poorest states. Louisiana residents use the most electricity per household in the United States. Upwards of one in five households in some parts of Louisiana can’t afford their monthly power bills.
At the same time, industries, which use almost half of Louisiana’s electricity, can opt out of paying for it. 
“I don’t think it’s appropriate,” Burke said, “for there to be such an opportunity for, quite frankly, patronage … to have zero-cost programs that low-income customers are paying for.”
Documentation missing, rules ignored
The energy efficiency programs run by Entergy Louisiana, Cleco and Southwestern Electric Power are guided by more than 12 pages of PSC rules requiring evaluation, verification and proof of cost effectiveness. The utilities must file hundreds of pages of documentation about their energy efficiency programs each year. Entergy Louisiana’s 2024 report was 520 pages. 
By contrast, the commissioners’ program requires a fraction of that documentation. The rules run just three pages. And record-keeping is scattershot; even the total amount spent on the program isn’t clear on an internal commission spreadsheet that loosely tracks the projects.
The few rules the commission has for its own program are not always followed. Floodlight could not locate any annual reports filed by any of the recipients, even though the eight-year-old program requires annual reports for three years after a project is finished. 
The PSC also could not find those records. Agency spokesperson Colby Cook said the agency would “circle back with recipients where the project has been completed to ensure they are in compliance with the reporting requirement.” 
The rules require a project “must demonstrate an improvement in energy efficiency.” But Lewis described the selection process as “undefined.” 
The applications are taken, evaluated, approved, and upon completion, inspected, almost entirely by the commissioners and their staff, though the commissioners began hiring part-time engineers in each district to help evaluate the applications in 2021. 
“This is an area of detail that is challenging and unlikely that commissioners or their staff would have the expertise in,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and national utility director for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 
  A 2020 Facebook post by Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta urges residents to re-elect him, citing his work to bring energy efficiency projects to benefit local governments. Shortly afterward, the watchdog Energy and Policy Institute revealed that Skrmetta’s business partner had gotten millions of dollars in contracts under the program, which is run by individual commissioners within their districts. (Facebook via the Wayback Machine)
Not ‘designed for cost savings’
It’s difficult to tell whether the prices charged under the commissioner-led program are fair. 
The invoices and projects are hard to compare, said Mike Morris, owner of MM Energy Solutions, the largest contractor with the public entities program. Even in the one district where a commissioner requires three bids on every project, those bids might be for completely different projects. 
Contractors don’t respond to a request for proposals (RFP) for the projects — which is standard in government contracting — but instead submit proposals they devise on their own. One might propose new tube lights, Morris said, while another flat panel lights, which can be more expensive but provide better lighting.
“There’s no way to compare it, because there’s no RFP with specifics on what you are actually bidding on,” he said. “It’s really hard to put an exact apple-to-apple on all this.”
In addition, Floodlight found that some of the projects approved by the commissioners won’t last long enough to pay for themselves. 
According to the PSC’s own records, it would take an estimated 249 years’ worth of energy savings at $600 a year to pay off the $124,000 cost of new lights on a softball field in Ascension Parish, south of Baton Rouge. And in 128 years, energy savings from lighting upgrades around Jefferson Parish would finally pay for the $650,000 cost of those lights. 
Floodlight found one-fifth of the commission’s projects will take more than 10 years to pay off — a common benchmark to determine if a project is worth the investment. 
Commissioners acknowledge replacing infrequently used lights, such as those at ballfields, is not the most effective for energy efficiency but that those projects benefit entire communities. 
The commissioners’ program “has not been designed for cost savings,” Burke said. 
“It has been designed to be an opportunity for … five elected officials to dole out money to the political entity of their choice.”
Program emerges ’out of the blue’
Harry Lopez in Iberia Parish isn’t the only one unfamiliar with the PSC’s public entities program. When Louisiana’s utility-run program came up for reauthorization in 2017, then-Commissioner Lambert Boissiere, a Democrat, introduced a never-publicly-discussed proposal to establish a commission-run energy efficiency program. It passed unanimously.
Bradley-Wright, who then worked at the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said the establishment of a new efficiency program was a complete surprise. 
“To my knowledge it had never come up before and did indeed come out of the blue,” Bradley-Wright said.
Floodlight found that Boissiere, who led the charge for the program, didn’t use any of that money for energy efficiency projects in his district for four years — until 2021. Longtime incumbent Boissiere was defeated in 2022 by Lewis, who inherited $16 million in unspent energy efficiency funds. 
Boissiere acknowledges the program has flaws.
“I felt that, in my opinion, it could have been administered in a more transparent manner,” he said. “It would make the policy that much better. I just always fought to make it a little better.”
Morris says many of the schools he’s worked at are long overdue for a lighting upgrade. He says some of the lighting hadn’t been changed since he went to middle school in Opelousas. Morris is 70.
“You ought to talk to these people in these schools,” Republican Commission Chairman Mike Francis said. “They’re flipping out man, with their cost savings and the new lights. They’re even complaining they’re too bright.”
Even Lewis, who has concerns about the program, isn’t shy about promoting its outcomes. Last year, he posted a photo of himself on Instagram with a $1.46 million check with officials from Southern University, which received more than $4 million from Lewis for energy-efficiency projects.
  The fees for the state’s energy efficiency programs are collected as two line items on customers’ bills as shown in this Southern University utility bill from 2022. Half of the revenue collected goes to an efficiency program run by Louisiana’s major utilities (the QS rider), and the other half (PE rider) funds the public entities program. (PSC records)
‘Free enterprise’ at work?
The public entities program is not advertised anywhere on the PSC website. It has received little press since it was created. Schools and other public agencies largely learn about the program like Lopez did, through a contractor who approaches them and offers to prepare an application to the appropriate commissioner. 
Skrmetta calls it “free enterprise,” with contractors talking to local governments to find out what they need.
In the early years of the program, one of Skrmetta’s business partners in a film production company won most of the contracts, according to research done by Tait of the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI). 
Since Tait blew the whistle on the relationship between Skrmetta and Jason Hewitt in 2020, Hewitt’s company, Brillant Efficiencies, no longer works with the program. 
“After this article came out,” Hewitt told Floodlight in an email, “we simply could no longer do business in the program as the negative press was too much to overcome.”
But Hewitt’s company had problems long before the EPI report.
In early 2020, Commissioner Foster Campbell refused to pay Brilliant Efficiencies the full amount invoiced for a completed lighting project at Grambling State University after repeatedly instructing Brilliant Efficiencies over several years to scale back the scope of the project. 
After Hewitt was awarded that contract, the Democratic commissioner implemented a bidding procedure in his district. His staff sought after-the-fact bids on the Grambling project, discovering “gaping price disparities” of up to $200,000 between Brilliant Efficiencies’ bid and other companies’ bids. 
Hewitt defended his work in a 77-page response to Campbell, saying among other things that the price comparisons were unfair and citing “unexpected delays and costs” associated with the new program. 
Skrmetta denied steering any business to Hewitt. Francis also denies favoritism in the program. 
“It looks like we’ve just got a couple of special friends,” Francis said, “and that’s just not the case at all.” 
Floodlight reviewed campaign finance records from 2017 on, finding seven donations totalling $6,250 to three commissioners from contractors who got business through the public entities program. 
A 2024 Floodlight investigation found Louisiana PSC members have cozy ties with the utilities they regulate, receiving nearly 43% of their campaign donations over the past 10 years — more than $8 million — from those companies and their allies. Louisiana law also lets commissioners engage in unreported private chats with representatives of the utilities they regulate — ”ex parte” communications that are banned or subject to strict reporting requirements in many other states, Floodlight found.
Burke says without a transparent selection process, entities without connections to the commissioners could be left out. “They are not selected on (the) most, greatest cost effectiveness,” she said. “It’s simply unclear who, how and and why winners and losers are selected.”
Dearth of bidding raises questions
The bulk of the work is handled by just a few contractors, including Morris, who started his contracting firm, MM Energy Solutions, in 2020 after a career in health and fitness. 
He quipped: “This is a lot easier than to try to convince a bunch of Cajun people to quit eating boudin, crackers and drinking beer.”
Morris says it’s the quality of his work — not his connections — that have led to contracts and subcontracts for more than 180 of the 515 projects approved. 
“Mike Francis is not handing out stuff to me. I got to earn my business. I’ve always had to earn my business with these guys,” Morris said. 
Campbell is the only commissioner who requires multiple bids for projects. In 2020, he introduced a motion to require bidding on all commission projects. It failed on a party-line 3-2 vote. 
Lewis says his office has received letters from the utilities — which pay the public entities’ contractors directly — questioning some program costs. The three utilities declined to comment on any problems with the program.
“The utilities have been very clear that this program is not run correctly,” Lewis said, citing concerns over inflated costs for light bulbs and invoices that are not “fully correct.” 
Lewis asked an Entergy Louisiana representative to discuss those issues at the PSC’s April meeting. But Larry Hand, Entergy’s vice president of regulatory affairs, demurred.
“Ultimately it is a commission-led program,” Hand said. “When we get the approval from the (commissioner’s) office and also from the (PSC) … that triggers our obligation to pay.”
Campbell says it’s up to the individual commissioners to make sure the job is done well “and not just take people’s word for it.” Campbell and Lewis have pushed for program reforms. Francis, the chairman, says he’s open to changes.
“If we get a majority of the commissioners say, ’Let’s put more checks and balances on the public entity side,’ I won’t disagree with that,” Francis said. “But right now, I feel comfortable with what kind of value we’re getting for the money we’re spending.”

Dozens of insurance companies, including Cigna, Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare, agreed to several measures, which include making fewer medical procedures subject to prior authorization and speeding up the review process. Insurers also pledged to use clear language when communicating with patients and promised that medical professionals would review coverage denials.
While Trump administration officials applauded the insurance industry for its willingness to change, they acknowledged limitations of the agreement.
“The pledge is not a mandate,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said during a news conference. “This is an opportunity for the industry to show itself.”
Oz said he wants insurers to eliminate preapprovals for knee arthroscopy, a common, minimally invasive procedure to diagnose and treat knee problems. Chris Klomp, director of the Center for Medicare at CMS, recommended prior authorization be eliminated for vaginal deliveries, colonoscopies, and cataract surgeries, among other procedures. Health insurers said the changes would benefit most Americans, including those with commercial or private coverage, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid managed care.
The insurers have also agreed that patients who switch insurance plans may continue receiving treatment or other health care services for 90 days without facing immediate prior authorization requirements imposed by their new insurer.
But health policy analysts say prior authorization — a system that forces some people to delay care or abandon treatment — may continue to pose serious health consequences for affected patients. That said, many people may not notice a difference, even if insurers follow through on their new commitments.
“So much of the prior authorization process is behind the black box,” said Kaye Pestaina, director of the Program on Patient and Consumer Protections at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Often, she said, patients aren’t even aware that they’re subject to prior authorization requirements until they face a denial.
“I’m not sure how this changes that,” Pestaina said.
The pledge from insurers follows the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot in midtown Manhattan in early December on the way to an investor meeting, forcing the issue of prior authorization to the forefront.
Oz acknowledged “violence in the streets” prompted Monday’s announcement. Klomp told KFF Health News that insurers were reacting to the shooting because the problem has “reached a fever pitch.” Health insurance CEOs now move with security details wherever they go, Klomp said.
“There’s no question that health insurers have a reputation problem,” said Robert Hartwig, an insurance expert and a clinical associate professor at the University of South Carolina.
The pledge shows that insurers are hoping to stave off “more draconian” legislation or regulation in the future, Hartwig said.
But government interventions to improve prior authorization will be used “if we’re forced to use them,” Oz said during the news conference.
“The administration has made it clear we’re not going to tolerate it anymore,” he said. “So either you fix it or we’re going to fix it.”
Here are the key takeaways for consumers:
1. Prior authorization isn’t going anywhere.
Health insurers will still be allowed to deny doctor-recommended care, which is arguably the biggest criticism that patients and providers level against insurance companies. And it isn’t clear how the new commitments will protect the sickest patients, such as those diagnosed with cancer, who need the most expensive treatment.
2. Reform efforts aren’t new.
Most states have already passed at least one law imposing requirements on insurers, often intended to reduce the time patients spend waiting for answers from their insurance company and to require transparency from insurers about which prescriptions and procedures require preapproval. Some states have also enacted “gold card” programs for doctors that allow physicians with a robust record of prior authorization approvals to bypass the requirements.
Nationally, rules proposed by the first Trump administration and finalized by the Biden administration are already set to take effect next year. They will require insurers to respond to requests within seven days or 72 hours, depending on their urgency, and to process prior authorization requests electronically, instead of by phone or fax, among other changes. Those rules apply only to certain categories of insurance, including Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.
Beyond that, some insurance companies committed to improvement long before Monday’s announcement. Earlier this year, UnitedHealthcare pledged to reduce prior authorization volume by 10%. Cigna announced its own set of improvements in February.
3. Insurance companies are already supposed to be doing some of these things.
For example, the Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to communicate with patients in plain language about health plan benefits and coverage.
But denial letters remain confusing because companies tend to use jargon. For instance, AHIP, the health insurance industry trade group, used the term “non-approved requests” in Monday’s announcement.
Insurers also pledged that medical professionals would continue to review prior authorization denials. AHIP claims this is “a standard already in place.” But recent lawsuits allege otherwise, accusing companies of denying claims in a matter of seconds.
4. Health insurers will increasingly rely on artificial intelligence.
Health insurers issue millions of denials every year, though most prior authorization requests are quickly, sometimes even instantly, approved.
The use of AI in making prior authorization decisions isn’t new — and it will probably continue to ramp up, with insurers pledging Monday to issue 80% of prior authorization decisions “in real-time” by 2027.
“Artificial intelligence should help this tremendously,” Rep. Gregory Murphy (R-N.C.), a physician, said during the news conference.
“But remember, artificial intelligence is only as good as what you put into it,” he added.
Results from a survey published by the American Medical Association in February indicated 61% of physicians are concerned that the use of AI by insurance companies is already increasing denials.
5. Key details remain up in the air.
Oz said CMS will post a full list of participating insurers this summer, while other details will become public by January.
He said insurers have agreed to post data about their use of prior authorization on a public dashboard, but it isn’t clear when that platform will be unveiled. The same holds true for “performance targets” that Oz spoke of during the news conference. He did not name specific targets, indicate how they will be made public, or specify how the government would enforce them.
While the AMA, which represents doctors, applauded the announcement, “patients and physicians will need specifics demonstrating that the latest insurer pledge will yield substantive actions,” the association’s president, Bobby Mukkamala, said in a statement. He noted that health insurers made “past promises” to improve prior authorization in 2018.
Meanwhile, it also remains unclear what services insurers will ultimately agree to release from prior authorization requirements.
Patient advocates are in the process of identifying “low-value codes,” Oz said, that should not require preapproval, but it is unknown when those codes will be made public or when insurers will agree to release them from prior authorization rules.

Out-of-state doctors are pushing for laws that will make it harder to detect who prescribes and sends abortion medication, as anti-abortion lawmakers look for ways to stop the flow of pills to their states.
Patients have continued to receive abortion pills in states with near-total bans, so much so that the number of abortions has actually increased since the fall of Roe v. Wade, despite near-total abortion bans. This is mostly thanks to “shield laws.” Working from states like New York, California and Massachusetts, providers meet virtually with pregnant patients in states with bans and write them abortion pill prescriptions. Patients receive the pills in the mail to take from home. One in 5 abortions are now done through telehealth, according to the Society of Family Planning, and about half of those are for people getting care because of shield laws.

THE NEVADA CONTEXT
The Nevada State Legislature this year passed Assembly Bill 411, which would have allowed prescriptions for drugs used for medical abortions and miscarriage management to list the name of the prescribing health care practice, rather than the name of the specific individual providing the prescription. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed the bill, writing in his veto letter that he believed the bill would reduce transparency in clinical follow-up situations where identifying the prescribing providers quickly may be crucial. – April Corbin Girnus

Now, doctors are working to anonymize that process by pushing to hide the name of the prescriber from the labels of mifepristone and misoprostol — the two drugs used in medication abortions. The effort marks a new step in the escalating battle between states over whether and how people in America can get abortions — and to what extent individual states’ laws can influence medical care coming from another.
“We are seeing two very different worlds right now in the United States in terms of the directions of laws and policies,” said Dr. Angel Foster, who provides telehealth abortions from Massachusetts to people in states with bans. “Shield law states are doing more to not only protect reproductive rights within their own state, but to protect avenues for all abortion seekers in the country to be able to get safe and legal care.”
Typically, prescription bottles include information such as the name of the doctor who prescribed medication, details about the medication and appropriate dosage, and the name of the patient receiving medication. But that information has become invaluable in civil and criminal cases filed by anti-abortion law enforcement officers.
A handful of states — New York, Maine, Vermont and Washington — have already passed laws to remove prescriber names from abortion pill bottles. Proposed legislation in Massachusetts, currently working through the state Senate, would similarly allow this change, although at least one shield law practice in the state, Foster’s Massachusetts Medication Abortion Project, has already removed prescribing doctors’ names from pill bottles citing guidance they received from the state attorney general.
A proposal in California, the largest shield law state, would go a step further. The bill, currently making its way through the state Senate, would remove not only the name of the prescribing health care provider but also the patient receiving medication. Proponents say that could protect patients who are concerned about someone discovering they ordered abortion pills.
The legislative trend comes as abortion opponents are ramping up efforts to stop telehealth abortion. Both Texas and Louisiana’s attorneys general have pushed criminal and civil cases targeting Dr. Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based physician who allegedly prescribed abortion pills to patients in those states. The cases pose a first test of shield laws and are likely to ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
The Texas suit against Carpenter was filed after a pregnant woman in the state developed bleeding and went to the hospital, according to court filings from the state. The filings assert that the “biological father of the unborn child” found medications that appeared to be prescribed by Carpenter.
“If an abusive partner were to find a package of abortion pills in the trash can, if it says Dr. XYZ, already you have someone to name in a lawsuit,” said Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has advised state lawmakers on crafting shield laws. “If it doesn’t have it, it’s a critical piece of information. How do you know who prescribed the pills?”
Separately, legislators in Texas unsuccessfully sought to end telehealth prescriptions with a bill, which died in the legislature, that would have allowed anyone to sue people who prescribe or send abortion pills to Texans for at least $100,000. Louisiana lawmakers are poised to pass legislation that would create similar punishment structures, allowing the “biological father,” his parents, or the parents of the pregnant person to file civil suits against out-of-state abortion providers.
Abortion rights supporters say that removing the doctor’s name from a prescription label would add security for those who rely on shield laws but are nervous about heightened efforts to target providers, a concern that has only grown since this weekend’s shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses. News outlets have reported that the suspected shooter, Vance Boelter, had a list of alleged targets in his car that included abortion providers.
“It goes a long way in ensuring that providers are protected at a time when we’ve seen increased violence and animus toward abortion providers and reproductive health providers generally,” said Lizzie Hinkley, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which worked to help pass such a bill in New York. “Anyone who has their name on a pill bottle will risk detection by hostile parties in states that have banned abortion.”
One California doctor who practices with telehealth practice A Safe Choice said he deliberately keeps a low profile. Only a few close friends know about his work providing abortions to people out-of-state. But through his organization, he hears almost once a week from other health care professionals who want to offer telehealth abortions to patients living under bans. He believes a bill like California’s could encourage even more to do so.
“Allowing the provision of services without the providers needing to put their name on the prescription labels will add an additional layer of security and confidence for the providers,” said the doctor, who asked that his name be withheld because of the ongoing legal threats against abortion providers. “This is a very important next step.”
The California bill could have an outsized impact. Most shield law prescriptions are filled by California-based pharmacies. That includes those called in by doctors who are practicing in other states, such as New York, but who don’t want to mail the pills themselves.
“There is no pharmacy in New York state that mails pills for us, so we have to rely on pharmacies in California,” said one physician in New York, who asked that her name be withheld because of the legal actions taken against Carpenter. “All the shield law providers across the country are waiting with bated breath for this bill to be passed.”
New York has passed a law removing prescriber names from abortion medication labels created in the state, she said, but that hasn’t affected her. Because she calls prescriptions into a pharmacy in California the labels are subject to the Golden State’s laws — and as a result, her name is still listed on the bottle when she orders abortion pills for out-of-state patients. Her patients live in states all over the country.
“It’s very stressful. I wish we could get California to move a bit faster,” she said.
The California bill has been approved by the state’s lower chamber but is still awaiting Senate passage. It’s faced little resistance and has received support from the state’s attorney general and lieutenant governor. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has built a public profile in part through vocal support of abortion protections, has not weighed in, and his office said he does not comment on pending legislation.
Still, there are legal questions about bills like California’s. Federal law requires that medication labels include the prescriber’s name — a stipulation that some argue could conflict with and possibly override the state-level protection.
But these questions haven’t been raised regarding other similar laws. Some legal scholars argued that the federal statute is ambiguous, and that pharmacies could say the state law still satisfies federal requirement by including the name of a medical practice — as New York’s and Maine’s do — rather than of an individual prescribing doctor or nurse.
“If you have the address and the practice and you’re able to easily identify where the prescription came from, that’s the purpose of this rule,” said Rachel Rebouché, dean of the Temple University School of Law. “The issue is being able to, for safety reasons and for monitoring, understand that someone who has the authority to do this has done it. There’s no question that putting the name of the practice does that.”
The blue-state push comes as abortion opponents have stepped up their efforts not only in individual states, but in their quest for national restrictions on mifepristone, calling for the federal government to prohibit dispensing it through telehealth.
That campaign has included building a body of research that they say highlights its potential risks — which runs against mainstream medical findings and that some researchers have said rely on “junk science.”
While President Donald Trump has remained quiet on abortion, members of his administration have suggested openness to curbing access to medication. This month, Food and Drug Commissioner Marty Makary committed to having his agency review mifepristone’s approval, though it’s not clear what that would ultimately mean. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he supports taking another look at the drug’s safety.
“In light of the situation at the FDA, it is urgent to ensure that California clinicians and pharmacists can prescribe and deliver mifepristone to the patients who rely on us,” Dr. Kelly Pfeifer, a California-based doctor who also provides abortions in Kansas, said at a committee hearing for the state’s bill. “This bill will allow us to continue to treat our patients even if politicians in Washington act against the science to further limit mifepristone.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/abortion-pills-scaled-1-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-06-25 07:05:41.086401

Not because ferocious hurricanes are bearing down, but because of the way its conservative “leaders” continue to endanger the youngest among us.
Florida is a crucible for casual violence foisted on children by egregious public policy which makes being a child or a young person in Florida dangerous.

This malign neglect directed towards children and teenagers is evident in Gov. Ron DeSantis’ continued pretense that there are no starving school-aged children, and that the state is more than capable of providing food and sustenance to them.
Organizations that provide food have long been raising the alarm about persistent hunger in the Sunshine State.
According to Feeding America, more than 2.3 million people endure hunger in Florida, with researchers estimating that between 613,000 and 800,000 of them are children.
However, DeSantis World ignores such realities because who knows better what we the people need than a petty, vindictive politician?
Child hunger in Florida has become nakedly partisan, as evidenced by DeSantis’ continued war against America’s poor, middle, and working classes. Twice in the past two years, the governor has refused about $500 million in federal monies for summer and school lunch programs. His people claim programs already operating in the state can more than handle the need.
In December 2023, Mallory McManus, deputy chief of staff of the Florida Department of Children and Families, told reporters: “We anticipate that our state’s full approach to serving children will continue to be successful this year without any additional federal programs that inherently always come with some federal strings attached.”
 ‘We’re good’
Advocates on the ground strenuously disagreed.
“One of the statements we continue to hear is that Florida already offers summer meal programs and therefore we’re good, we don’t really need a program such as Sun Bucks [a federal food program]. I surely wish that were true,” said Sky Beard, Florida program director of No Kid Hungry.
“The work we and other partners do demonstrates that’s an inaccurate perception. Less than 10% of children who participate in free and reduced lunch during the school year are also able to get a summer meal.”
No Kid Hungry Florida issued a report in 2024 that detailed food insecurity’s effects on low-income and even middle-income Florida families and children as a result of the increasingly untenable cost of living. The report found that 72% of Floridians found it more difficult to afford groceries compared to the year before.
“This burden isn’t limited to lower-income households; 60% of middle-income families, earning between $50,000 to $99,000, are also feeling the pinch. Amidst a growing affordability crisis, putting nutritious meals on the table has become a daunting task for many,” the report says.
Meanwhile, DeSantis and his MAGA Republicans allies are steadfastly rejecting federal funds — on ideological grounds — to expand Medicaid for the working poor, the vulnerable, and those mired in poverty.
 Discarding children
The organization ProtectOurCare detailed DeSantis’ longstanding antipathy towards providing access to healthcare via the Affordable Care Act.
“As governor, Ron DeSantis has 0revented hundreds of thousands of Florida residents — disproportionately people of color — from receiving coverage by refusing the expand Medicaid,” the organization said in a fact sheet on its website.
“Florida Republicans, led by Ron DeSantis since 2019, have been blocking Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, preventing up to 726,000 Floridians from obtaining Medicaid coverage, remaining a ‘hard no’ on expanding Medicaid even as millions of residents faced hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Of the hundreds of thousands of currently uninsured residents that would become eligible for the program if DeSantis expanded Medicaid under the ACA, around 57% are people of color, with Black residents disproportionately shut out of coverage, comprising 28 percent of those in the coverage gap despite forming just 17% of Florida overall.”
This indecent, immoral behavior and the scripted discarding of children is perhaps seen most profoundly with DeSantis and Republicans’ cold-hearted disregard for the slaughter of the state’s children because of America’s obsession with guns and Republicans’ obeisance to the National Rifle Association and the formidable gun lobby.
Florida’s next generation is dying in alarming numbers and neither DeSantis nor any of his Republican MAGA allies has raised a hand to protect young people as people have endured school shootings and suicides.
In Florida, like the rest of the United States, guns account for the most deaths among children and teenagers. According to CNN, gun deaths continue to be the leading cause of death for young people since surpassing car accidents in 2020.
 Preventable
Everytown, America’s largest gun violence-prevention organization, tells us that “mass shootings haunt our nation’s collective conscience. Each breaking-news alert floods the nation with grief, fear, and anger at the countless acts of preventable violence.”
Perhaps most heartbreaking is that the vast majority of these deaths are preventable. Among children and teens:

Firearms are the leading cause of death for American children and teens.
More than 2,800 children and teens die by gun homicide every year. For children under the age of 13, these gun homicides most frequently occur in the home and are often connected to domestic or family violence.
Black children and teens in the U.S. are more than 18 times more likely than white children and teens of the same age to die by gun homicide.
Firearms accounted for 18% of childhood deaths (ages 1 to 18) in 2023, the most recent year for which data are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

About 3,500 children died in gun-related incidents that year. That’s about five children lost for every 100,000 children in the United States. In no other comparable country are firearms within the top four causes of mortality among children, according to a KFF analysis.
This weak response has been profoundly influenced by the National Rifle Association and America’s gun lobby. All victims and communities get from DeSantis, Republicans, and the NRA are “thoughts and prayers,” and legislation to bolster school security and promote mental health services. Their prescriptions fall far short of dealing with this national nightmare.
 Backtracking
Unbelievably, Gov. DeSantis has said he supports repealing the existing age requirements that prohibits 18-20-year-olds from buying rifles, shotguns, and other long guns from licensed gun dealers and handguns from private owners. He also advocates repealing red-flag laws and wants to allow Floridians to open-carry weapons.
Meanwhile, DeSantis on May 28 signed into law HB 6025, which eliminates restrictions on firearm and ammunition sales during locally declared emergencies.
The effects of gun violence are incalculable in terms of the loss of life, injuries, psychological damage, and economic fallout.
“Mass shootings in the U.S. have significant consequences for mental health, the economy, and community well-being,” according to a recent INFORMS Marketing Science Journal study. “They can lead to long-term mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and PTSD, not only for direct victims but also for those exposed to the events or living in affected communities … .”
Where is the anger; where is the outrage? Where are the voluminous public protests and demands that our “leaders” do their damn jobs. Are we to believe that the majority of Florida’s parents are cool with what our political leaders have done, are doing?
When it comes to stamping out violent crime, these people refuse to restrict unlawful gun purchases; implement universal background checks; safety training; safe and secure gun storage; implementing stricter provisions on gun owners carrying firearms in public spaces; concealed carry permit requirements and limitations; or limits on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which can cause extensive harm.
Theologian and activist Traci Blackmon captures the barbarism in which the MAGA Republican minority is so completely immersed:
“Who is this ‘god’ they worship? This god of guns but not of grace? This god of greed but not generosity? This god of the womb but not of the woman?”
And the children suffer.

(Screenshot from oral arguments)Indiana’s highest court weighed allegations of TikTok’s alleged deceptive practices in the Hoosier State on Tuesday, skeptical of arguments from both sides about jurisdictional issues. 
The two suits, heard together, were filed by Attorney General Todd Rokita against the popular, short-form video app in December 2022 in Fort Wayne. He accused TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, of violating Indiana’s Deceptive Consumer Sales Act with its age rating for those 12 and older — claiming that it contained more sexual content, profanity and drug references than advertised.
Rokita’s TikTok legal battle part of array of contingency fee contracts

The above made TikTok unsafe for children, he continued. Additionally, he claimed in a separate lawsuit that the company failed to protect user data from the Chinese Communist Party.
Justices noted ongoing national security concerns about the app, including a rare bipartisan law requiring ByteDance to sell the app to an American company. President Donald Trump, who embraced the app in his second campaign, has intervened and delayed that law’s implementation three times. 
“Congress doesn’t agree on much, but they agreed on this. And the (U.S.) Supreme Court said it’s okay to (ban) in this context,” said Justice Christoper Goff. “But now, we’re on pause … this seems to be a completely unique circumstance. And I cannot, for the life of me, imagine, with all of that going on, why it would be appropriate for us, or reasonable for us, to cite the precedent to exercise jurisdiction here and write a rule for all time.”
Conservative and liberal lawmakers both cite worries about TikTok’s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, and its ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Some have openly wondered if the app feeds user data to Chinese authorities, including Rokita.
“Our lawsuit against TikTok was filed to protect our children and to protect our data privacy that we allege is being stolen by the Chinese Communist Party. We maintain their business model intentionally deceives children and adults to drive up profits by saying it is appropriate for kids and that your personal data is safe. Neither is true,” the office said in a statement in 2023. 
The lower courts dismissed Rokita’s suits and the agency appealed the case to the Indiana Supreme Court. State attorneys on Tuesday countered that the “federal law over the divestiture of ownership of TikTok has nothing to do with this case,” maintaining that the issue at hand was “deceptive and misleading representations made to consumers.”
 Arguments before the court

Attorney Brian Paul, representing TikTok and ByteDance, argued that the Indiana Supreme Court wasn’t the appropriate venue for the case, which is the first issue before the justices.
“Indiana is seeking to punish TikTok for statements that were not made in Indiana, that are not about Indiana, that were not targeted at Indiana and were not tailored to Indiana,” Paul said in his opening remarks. 
The state previously argued that justices could intervene because Hoosiers enter into user contracts with TikTok when they download the app.
Paul said because TikTok has no physical presence in the state, not even a server, Indiana wasn’t appropriate for the lawsuit — though the company makes $46 million off of Hoosier data annually by using collected data to tailor advertiser content, plaintiffs said.

Justices seemed to doubt that reasoning, pointing to other products, like magazines shipped across state boundaries, and legal precedent. 
“TikTok seeks to escape the rules that apply to everyone else, from print magazines to burger franchises,” said Solicitor General James Barta, arguing on behalf of the state. 
Barta said that these “daily exchange(s) of data” are used by the plaintiffs to craft “addictive content” based on user locations to earn millions.
“And yet, TikTok says Indiana courts can do nothing to hold it accountable for misleading and deceptive statements that induced Indiana parents to download this app for themselves or for their children, and that ultimately end up harming children and other users,” Barta concluded.
Chief Justice Loretta Rush wondered if such a broad application of Indiana law might capture other apps and social media companies anytime a Hoosiers accepts a website’s cookies or agrees to a user contract. 
“Every one of those is going to be subject to (our jurisdiction) no matter where they’re located or the product?” Rush asked. “… are we going to now have personal jurisdiction of any company that grabs and sells data in Indiana, no matter how small?”
That concern appeared to resonate with some of Rush’s fellow justices. 
“The implications for things like free speech, for interstate commerce seemed, to me, to be just breathtaking,” said Goff.

In response, Barta said the core of the case was about deception and misleading consumers and that the state “has a significant interest in protecting its consumers, in having its courts interpret its laws.”
Justice Derek Molter noted, however, that it was “unusual” to claim a violation of Indiana’s Deceptive Consumer Sales Act without the exchange of money. 
“… it is core to TikTok’s business model to be able to monetize users’ time and attention and this is, of course, not the only company that does this,” Barta said. “… it would be awfully odd to say that the legislature has been completely unaware of this, and yet has decided to do nothing about it with the Deceptive Consumer Sales Act.”
He said the law doesn’t cover “free” transactions, but does apply to an exchange of goods and services. He contends that Tiktok users exchange their data for entertainment. The state is seeking civil penalties and a jury trial as allowed under that law. 
Justices, led by Rush, indicated they would issue their ruling “in due course.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-25 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Richard Jordan set to be executed,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/25/richard-jordan-set-to-be-executed/,Richard Jordan's appeals to courts and for clemency from the governor fail to halt scheduled execution.,"Barring a last minute reprieve, the state of Mississippi is set to execute Richard Jordan this evening. 
Attorneys representing the 79-year-old, the state’s oldest and longest serving inmate on death row, filed a flurry of motions with the U.S. Supreme Court and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals this week. As of today, the appeals court denied his request for stay, and the high court hads not responded to a request for stay.
A week after receiving a clemency petition for Jordan, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves denied it. Reeves has not granted anyone clemency during his two terms in office. 
He said Jordan admitted being guilty of kidnapping Edwina Marter at gunpoint from her family’s home in coastal Harrison County in 1976 while her 3-year-old son was sleeping, and of forcing Marter to drive into a forest and killing her by shooting her in the back of the head.
“At this time, all necessary procedures are being followed with the anticipation that the execution will proceed as scheduled.”
Jordan was first convicted in 1976 for the kidnapping and murder of 34-year-old Edwina Marter, a mother of two, on the Gulf Coast. 
He had four trials before a death sentence stuck in 1998, and in the following decades, Jordan has sought appeals of his conviction. 
Edwina Marter’s now-adult sons, Eric and Kevin, and her husband, Charles, do not plan to attend the execution, but Edwina Marter’s brother is expected to be a witness. 
Eric Marter previously told Mississippi Today that he would have liked Jordan’s death sentence to have been carried out sooner, not almost 50 years after the fact. 
Advocates from the state, the South and beyond have called for Jordan’s sentence to be commuted to life without the possibility of parole, echoing some reasons cited by Jordan’s attorneys, including his age and potential safety risk, how long he has been in prison, and a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder from service in the Vietnam War. 
About a decade ago, Jordan and fellow death row inmate Ricky Chase became the lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the state’s execution lethal injection protocol. 
Last week, U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate ruled that Jordan’s execution could proceed, writing that he had not proved that the state’s lethal injection protocol was likely to cause “serious illness and needless suffering.”
He also cited a previous Supreme Court ruling that states the 8th Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment doesn’t guarantee prisoners a painless death. 
Wingate, however, did issue a provision: the state has to stop Jordan’s execution if he shows signs of consciousness. 
This is the second execution Wingate has allowed to proceed for plaintiffs and intervenors in the lawsuit. The previous death row inmate who asked Wingate for a stay based on his involvement in the suit was Thomas Loden Jr., who was executed in 2022.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081403/AP060710014048.jpg,,,2025-06-25 08:03:30.138174

House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, on Monday formed the Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform and empowered it to study Missouri’s property tax system and recommend “solutions to ensure fairness, transparency and sustainability for taxpayers and municipalities across the state.”
The committee’s formation comes on the heels of Patterson floating the idea of a special legislative session in September, when lawmakers are already required to consider whether to override gubernatorial vetoes.
“You go around to any of the counties… and they’re bringing up property taxes,” Patterson said earlier this month. “This is a huge problem. I would say it goes to crisis levels.”
Property taxes are the main source of revenue for local governments, funding schools, public safety and other functions. Rising housing costs, coupled with property reassessments, have put the way the taxes are calculated under the microscope, with lawmakers looking to provide relief to taxpayers without bankrupting local governments.
Missouri school funding task force turns its attention to property tax inequities

The topic even emerged as part of discussion over the state’s public school funding formula. A state task force created to study Missouri’s education spending spent its latest hearing this week focused on how property taxes have contributed funding inequities.
When Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back into session earlier this month to consider a $1.5 billion incentive package for professional sports stadiums in Kansas City, he agreed to allow an amendment requiring most counties to put a hard cap on increases in property tax bills.
In 75 counties, tax bills would not increase more than 5% per year from a base amount, or the rate of inflation, whichever is less. In 22 others, no increase in the basic bill would be allowed.There are exceptions built in for newly voted levies and the additional value from improvements.
Many of the larger counties of the state, including Boone, Greene, Jackson, St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis, were excluded altogether from the legislation.
The property tax amendment caused a fissure among conservatives in the Missouri Senate. Some supported the measure in an attempt to win tax relief concessions during the special session. Others decried it as an unconstitutional bait and switch designed to fool taxpayers, pointing to a requirement in the Missouri Constitution that property taxes be “uniform upon the same class or subclass of subjects.”
Even Patterson, who voted in support of the bill that included stadium funding and the property tax cap, acknowledged questions about whether it could survive a constitutional challenge.
“One thing I don’t do is guess what is going to happen in our courts,” Patterson said. “I’ve heard from a lot of attorneys that say it absolutely is. I’ve heard from some that said that it isn’t. I do think it’s constitutional.”
The interim committee created by Patterson will hold seven hearings across the state this summer to gather input and explore legislative solutions. State Rep. Tim Taylor, a Republican from Bunceton, will serve as chairman.
State Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, a Columbia Democrat, will serve as the ranking minority member.
“Property taxes are one of the most common concerns we hear from Missourians,” Taylor said, “and it’s clear that our system needs a closer look.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125_patterson1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-06-25 07:05:41.086401

I have watched patients come back from the edge only to wake up to nothing: a referral sheet, no phone, no ride, and no plan. The ER doors close, but the crisis continues.
Narcan, or naloxone, is often called an overdose antidote. That is not how it works. It does not resolve an overdose. It interrupts it. It buys time. What exists in that time, or does not, determines what happens next. In many parts of Missouri, that time leads nowhere.
In my region, the nearest detox facility may be two counties away. Behavioral health beds are nearly impossible to find. Transportation is unreliable or nonexistent. Follow-up care, when it exists, is often out of reach or out of network.
I have seen people arrive unresponsive, receive Narcan, then walk out of the hospital hours later. No ride. No contact. No plan. Just a printout and a warning. That is not recovery. That is abandonment.
Medicaid expansion was supposed to address some of these failures. It did not. Coverage on paper does not mean care in practice. I have seen patients with active Medicaid turned away because no local provider would accept them. I have watched people deteriorate while waiting for treatment that never came.
We were trained to administer Narcan. We were not trained to discharge someone into the same conditions that nearly killed them. There is no protocol for that moment. No guidance for the guilt that follows.
Narcan became available without a prescription in 2023. That mattered. But availability is not the same as access.
In the Ozarks and the Bootheel, many pharmacies still do not stock it. Some pharmacists still refuse to dispense it. Insurance coverage is inconsistent. Stigma continues to decide who receives care and who is left behind.
When formal systems failed, local initiatives stepped up. Programs like MO-CORPS trained bartenders, teachers, shelter workers and pastors. They distributed thousands of naloxone kits. They stocked Narcan in gas stations and churches. They did it on limited funding because they live in these communities, too.
In 2024, Missouri saw a 25% drop in overdose deaths — the first real progress in years.
In 2025, Congress proposed cutting $56 million from naloxone programs. That money supplies clinics, jails, and shelters. It trains first responders. It keeps people alive. Cutting it is not streamlining. It is surrender.
Some claim that we have done enough. That Narcan is widely available and the rest is a matter of personal responsibility. But anyone who has worked in a rural ER knows that survival does not end when someone starts breathing again. It begins there. What happens next is what matters. And in too many cases, there is no next.
Narcan is not treatment. It is not housing. It is not transportation. It is not recovery. It is a tool. It buys time. Without systems to support that time, we are wasting it.
Scaling back now is not efficient. It is dangerous.
In rural Missouri, it will mean fewer kits in squad cars. Longer waits for ambulances. More people dying alone. More families finding their loved ones too late.
We know what works. We are choosing not to fund it. That is not a lapse in policy. It is a failure of will.
Fund naloxone programs. Protect MO-CORPS. Require Narcan in public buildings. Expand Medicaid-funded treatment. Train rural providers in trauma-informed care. Stop making survival dependent on zip code and income.
I have pushed Narcan. I have managed the drip. I have watched people wake up to a world that offers them no way forward.
This could have been the start of something stronger.
Instead, we are watching it disappear.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Narcan-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-25 07:05:41.086401

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)With the state’s budget deadline less than a week away, the Wisconsin State Assembly approved a slate of bills that would create new programs but withheld funding, which Republicans said would come later. Democrats criticized Republicans, saying they couldn’t trust that the funding would actually be passed. The body also approved a pair of bills related to nuclear power and bills that will increase penalties for criminal offenses.
Assembly Republicans gathered ahead of the floor session to stress the need for bipartisan negotiations and progress on writing the state budget.
Budget negotiations fell apart last week for the second time as Senate Republicans walked away from talks with Gov. Tony Evers. Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said in a statement at the time that discussions were “heading in a direction that taxpayers cannot afford.” 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said during a press conference that he has been in communication with Evers, including on Tuesday morning. 
Vos said the discussions about child care funding are “preliminary” with “a lot of details to be worked out.” He said Assembly Republicans remain “steadfast” in its opposition to “writing checks out to providers” but are open to working with Evers on child care. 
Evers told reporters Monday he wouldn’t sign a budget if it doesn’t include money for child care.
“Republicans need to get their act together and come back and let’s finish it up,” Evers said.
Asked if he would sign a budget that doesn’t include funding for the state’s Child Care Counts program, Evers said “no.” 
Evers has not vetoed a budget in full during his time in office, though he has exercised his partial veto power extensively, rejecting major tax cuts and making changes to extend increases for school revenue – to the great irritation of Republicans.
“I think in the end we’ll be able to find a consensus around that topic,” Vos said about child care funding. 
Vos also said Republicans are already taking some action related to child care. Assembly Republicans have announced measures including a 15% tax credit for the business expenses at child care facilities, no-interest loans and allowing 16-year-olds to be counted as full staff as ways of addressing the crisis.
Evers said discussions about the funding for the University of Wisconsin had included “a positive number” though he wouldn’t go into details. Last week, Vos said his caucus intended to cut $87 million from the UW system. 
“I know we’re going to make investments in trying to make sure that parents have access to child care, I know we’re going to make a historic investment in special ed funding and I know we’re going to do some reforms at the university. Those are all things that we would love to do as part of a bigger deal,” Vos said, adding that legislators have to make sure any plan can get through both the Assembly and the Senate and then to Evers. 
Vos said the most thing thing for Assembly Republicans is getting tax cuts passed and signed by Evers, saying they have learned from previous budgets where tax cuts have been vetoed and other parts of the budget is approved. The budget committee has approved a $1.3 billion tax cut package for the budget bill already.
“It’s better for us to find a compromise,” Vos said. “We’d like to have a guarantee from Gov. Evers that we’re going to get tax cuts signed into law. In exchange, he would like a guarantee that we’re going to have some increases in investments that he cares about.”
Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said he is in communication with Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) working on figuring out when the budget committee will meet next. 
“We’re hopeful our Senate colleagues will join us in the next couple of days,” Born said.
 The deadline for the budget — and end of the fiscal year — is June 30.
“I think if we are actively talking about a budget in the next couple of days, we can hammer out details in a hurry. That’s the way budgets are built. If people are ready to work, we’ll get things done,” Born said. 
Republicans have a slim 18-15 majority in the state Senate, which is leading to some difficulties passing a budget, as their caucus can only lose one vote and still get a budget passed without Democratic votes. Two members — Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) — have expressed concerns about the budget.
Nass laid out several “benchmarks” that would get him to vote for a budget in a press release Tuesday, including a $3.5 billion one-time tax rebate that would provide $1,600 to joint filers and $800 to individual tax filers, ensuring the new budget doesn’t create a structural deficit and making cuts of $700 million to $1 billion and no more than $1.5 billion in new bonding for buildings.
“I will not support the Vos-Evers budget proposal because it contains too much spending, special interest pork and the creation of a significant structural deficit,” Nass said. “The Vos-Evers budget plan is neither conservative nor taxpayer friendly. However, if passed it would be a big win for the politicians and lobbyists.”
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), who is a member of the Joint Finance Committee, called Nass’ proposal “reckless” in a social media post and said Republicans are in “disarray.” 
“It shows that Republicans do not care about maintaining the essential services that Wisconsinites need and want — public schools, UW, roads, healthcare,” Roys wrote. “We need a budget by June 30 or all of it is at serious risk.” 
Bills passed that will rely on funding in budget
The state budget overshadowed debate about several other bills Tuesday as Democrats complained about the lack of funding included in the bills and the lack of trust they have that Republicans will release the funding. 
Republicans, however, said the funding would come later in the budget. A similar argument took place in the state Senate last week. 
Republicans are splitting the bills from the funding as a way of working around Evers’ veto power. Evers has objected to this. Evers’ legislative affairs director sent letters to Republican lawmakers telling them that if they want their bills to become law, the policy needs to be included in the budget, the funding needs to be attached to the bill or the bill needs to include language that states the policy only goes into effect if there is funding. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said at the start of session Tuesday that lawmakers have yet to take meaningful action on the budget and that is unacceptable.
“I want to be very clear about what happens in Wisconsin, if we fail to pass a budget before July 1. There will be no new special education, mental health, or nutrition spending for our schools. Project positions will end overnight. There will be cuts to programs like county conservation and tourism, and much more,” Neubauer said. “There are real consequences to not passing a budget on time. It will hurt Wisconsinites, and it really is unacceptable. It does not need to be this way.”
Neubauer said that Republicans are allowing the “extremists” in their party to hold up the budget process when lawmakers should be listening to their constituents. She said the floor session is an example of Republicans ineffectiveness.
“Even as the budget process is in complete chaos, the majority is writing a series of unfunded bills to the floor that they allege would receive funding in the budget,” Neubauer said. “My biggest question right now is, what budget? Republicans do not have a plan to fund these bills. They do not have a plan for our state budget, and they don’t have a plan to move our state forward. Wisconsin deserves better.”
Unfunded bills create ‘bizarre budget’ process
One bill — AB 279 — would instruct the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to create a talent recruitment grant program meant to lure out-of-state families to relocate to Wisconsin. It passed by voice vote.
Rep. Alex Joers (D-Middleton) said he supports the idea but is concerned about the lack of funding.
“It creates a grant program and there’s no grants, there’s no funding in this bill,” Joers said. “You all need to fund your bills.” 
Bill author Rep. David Armstrong (R-Rice Lake) said his bill would help communities market themselves to people looking to relocate. He said he delivered five motions to the committee, but none were included. The committee took action on the WEDC budget earlier this month. 
“They told me to get these passed through the House and through the Senate and they’ll come back and find the funding,” Armstrong said, adding that he agrees the program shouldn’t be mandated without the money.
SB 106, which the Assembly concurred in, would provide the framework for the Department of Health Services to certify psychiatric residential treatment facilities. The facilities would provide in-patient care for people under 21 and are aimed at helping keep young people in crisis stay in-state for care.
Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) said it is “outrageous” that the bill doesn’t include funding. 
“It’s not a workable bill if it’s not funded,” Vining said. “This is irresponsible governing. It is fiscally irresponsible. You guys have got to stop playing games.” 
Rep. Patrick Snyder (R-Weston) said the bill is critical so that young people in crisis have support from the state and their families. When it comes to funding, he said that would come later.
“It will be coming up in separate legislation as we negotiate, as this budget moves forward. We are not going to put a bill out without funding, and I don’t appreciate scare tactics like that because this won’t happen, I have a lot of budget motions, and I am working with JFC to get that accomplished,” Snyder said. “Let’s work on getting the foundation built and then finding out the cost and fund it.” 
SB 108 would require DHS to develop a portal to facilitate sharing of safety plans for a minor in crisis with specific people. It passed in a voice vote.
SB 283 requires the Department of Transportation to create a public protective services hearing protection program to provide specialized hearing protection devices to law enforcement and fire departments. 
Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) said the bill is really good, but won’t work without funding.
“We’ve heard that Joint Finance is going to fund something, and it doesn’t happen,” Emerson said. “$15 million for hospitals in the Chippewa Valley still sitting in Joint Finance. Money for the reading program, still sitting in Joint Finance. Money for PFAS, still sitting in Joint Finance. There’s a lot of broken trust between the people of Wisconsin and that committee, so we need to see that the funding is here. We need to see it right now. Otherwise, I don’t see how we can get a bill like this passed.”
Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha), who is a member of the Joint Finance Committee, said during debate that Republicans have “set the stage for a bizarre budget” by approaching new policy in this way. He said Republicans have previously asked Democrats to trust funding will be released as they’ve allocated funding in a roundabout way, noting that in previous budget cycles lawmakers put money in supplemental funds as a way of requiring additional approval from the budget committee before the money was released.
“I voted for a literacy bill last year — $50 million to help kids read — and that money is still sitting there… We have the ability to appropriate funds, so we could have added funding to all these bills today,” McGuire said. 
McGuire said Republicans could be aiming to effectively reduce agencies’ budgets by mandating new projects without including the funding. 
“There’s the possibility that this is just a secret way of cutting agencies and of robbing every other program that those agencies administer because that’s what happens if we don’t administer the funds,” McGuire said. “Those agencies have to make the choice between the program that we require them to allocate funds for and other programs… and it makes it harder for people to receive services that they already need.” 
Nuclear power bills
The Assembly approved a pair of bills meant to move progress on nuclear energy in Wisconsin, which will now head to Evers’ desk for consideration.
One bill — SB 125 — would require the Public Service Commission to conduct a study to determine potential sites for a nuclear power plant. 
The other — SB 124 — would create a Nuclear Power Summit Board in Wisconsin meant to host a summit in Madison to advance nuclear power and fusion energy technology and development and to showcase Wisconsin’s leadership and innovation in the nuclear industry. The summit would need to be held within the month after instruction starts at the new engineering building at UW-Madison, which is supposed to be finished in 2028. The funding for the building was approved by the Legislature and Evers in 2024. 
Rep. Supreme Moore Omokunde (D-Milwaukee) said he is concerned about Wisconsin’s energy, but the bills as they are are missing some steps.
“Where’s our integrated resource plan? Have we developed one? In other states, they have an integrated resource plan, which lets us know just how much carbon emitting fuel we need to be producing and let’s not produce any more than that,” Moore Omokunde said. “We need to be determining the speed of nuclear energy, the cost, the safety.” 
Moore Omokunde said the state should take an “all of the above” approach and consider different types of energy including nuclear, wind and solar to allow Wisconsin to better decide its “energy future.”.
Snyder said that with technological advances, including artificial intelligence, other types of energy such as windmills and solar won’t be able to provide enough energy. 
“This is something for the future. If you want the cleanest energy, you have to include nuclear,” Snyder said. “We can’t be living in the past of Chernobyl. Fear does not move us forward.” 
Sortwell compared technological advances in energy production to the difference between the Flintstones and the Jetsons. He said lawmakers worked with Evers’ office and the PSC and other stakeholders on the bill. Evers had proposed including $1 million in the state budget to support a nuclear power plant feasibility study.
“The nuclear renaissance is upon us here in Wisconsin and in the United States, and it’s time for everybody else to get on board,” Sortwell said. 
New and increased penalties
The Assembly also passed bills that increase — or create — criminal penalties. 
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) spoke in opposition to the slate of bills, saying they will contribute to mass incarceration in Wisconsin. 
“Locking people up does not need to be the solution to every single piece of legislation,” Clancy said. “Incarceration has become this Legislature’s default response to every single claim you think is wrong in this state. It’s incredibly harmful and it doesn’t work.”
AB 26 would make it a Class H felony to threaten or commit battery against a juror or a member of a juror’s family. 
While talking about this bill, Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) said he was thankful Clancy was in the “minority of the minority of the minority” on the issue. He said it would help protect family members of jurors.
“While you may as an individual juror not feel particularly at risk yourself, maybe you’re concerned about your family being threatened, and so this is making sure once again that we have a justice system that is deciding on the merits of the case,” Sortwell said.
AB 35 would change current law that says candidates can’t remove their names from ballots unless they are dead. The bill comes in reaction to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. trying unsuccessfully to remove himself from the Wisconsin presidential ballot in 2024 after he dropped out and endorsed President Donald Trump.
Under the bill, candidates withdrawing from national or statewide races would have to pay the Wisconsin Elections Commission a $1,000 fee — or $250 for a non-statewide office. 
The bill would also make it a Class G felony with a maximum penalty of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years if someone intentionally makes or files a false statement withdrawing a person’s candidacy.
AB 53 would also make it a Class H felony to cause or threaten to cause bodily harm to a community service officer in response to an action the CSO took in an official capacity. It is currently a class A misdemeanor to cause bodily harm to another person.
AB 65 would make it a Class F felony with a maximum penalty of $25,000 and 12 years and 6 months in prison if someone intentionally enters another person’s home without consent with intent to commit battery.

But key support for survivors may be slipping away.,Amanda Hernández,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/06/25/more-states-are-tracking-rape-kits-but-key-support-for-survivors-may-be-slipping-away/,New Jersey has joined the states that now require tracking of rape kits — but advocates fear the potential loss of federal aid could create more backlogs.,"New Jersey has joined the states that now require tracking of rape kits — but advocates fear the potential loss of federal aid could create more backlogs. (Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.










We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Idaho rancher Jay Smith has a wolf problem.
Over the last 20 years, Smith said wolves have killed more than 200 of his cattle and caused major financial harm to his family’s business.
﻿
“At today’s value at nearly $2,000 a head, times that by 200 and see if we could have invested that money over time what would that have been?” Smith said. “Significant.”
Smith and his wife, Chyenne, raise Black Angus cattle near the town of Carmen, a tiny community near the Continental Divide, just west of the Montana border.
Jay grew up nearby; his family has been ranching in the area since 1924.
Last year, the family celebrated its centennial on the land.
But their history goes back even longer.
Smith has a family history book documenting cattle ownership back to the 1600s.
“So my family’s cattle raising lineage goes way back,” Smith said.
There’s something else that goes way back in Smith’s family: Warnings about wolves that have been passed down through the generations.
 Idaho rancher ‘got to be a cowboy every day’ of his life 

The J Lazy S Angus Ranch is situated in a green valley set in the shadows of high mountain peaks, some of which rise above 10,000 feet.
Wildfire smoke often hangs in the air during the summer. And on the other side of the valley, the Salmon River cuts through the landscape.

The ranch features a classic red barn, a horse corral, an assortment of farm machinery and a renovated old cabin surrounded by shade trees.
They have a small herd of Morgan-Quarter Horse crossbreeds and an array of cattle dogs that go everywhere with the Smiths, including high up in the surrounding mountains.
“One of the main reasons Chyenne and I bought this place is A, because ranching is in my blood,” Smith said. “But B, it’s exactly how we wanted to raise our children. I wanted them to have the work ethic and the animal husbandry background that I grew up with. I think it’s very important.”
Running cattle and working the ranch is all he’s ever known, and Smith wouldn’t trade it for anything.
“I don’t know if you ever watch TV, but I got to be a cowboy every day of my life, so I don’t know how you go wrong there,” Smith said. “(There is) a lot of freedom. These ranches are big, and so we had a lot of private property where us kids could go a long ways without getting in trouble or being in the wrong spot. And I don’t know how a city kid could ever get their head around that, but we could literally go for miles and not be somewhere we shouldn’t be.”
 Ranching and living in wolf ground zero

The Smiths’ several hundred cattle have a lot of room to roam, too.
During summers, the cows live in the high country. They spend 12 to 16 weeks each in a cow camp way up in the mountains, roaming far and wide on public land.
And that’s where they run into trouble with wolves.
Only a few ridgelines separate Smith’s ranch from wolf ground zero: one of the original sites of reintroduction 30 years ago – Corn Creek in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.
From their porch on the ranch, Jay and Chyenne Smith can see the Diamond Moose Grazing allotment, where wolves have a track record killing and harassing livestock, Smith said.

“It’s been one of the most consistently conflicted allotments throughout the years,” Smith said.
Jay Smith was 22 years old in 1995 when the government reintroduced wolves. He has seen ranching before wolves were reintroduced and the difference the animals made after they were reintroduced.
“We worked really hard to keep (reintroduction) from happening,” Smith said. “And then when it became inevitable and we could see the writing on the wall, then we started trying to position ourselves for how to live with the inevitable. It was coming. We’ve been here 100 years. We’re not leaving. So now how do we make this work?”
 Idaho rancher affected by wolf depredation says compensation hard to come by

Not only do the wolves literally eat into their business, but every time the Smiths or other ranchers speak out or try to do something about it, they say they are vilified.
“The negativity and the hate towards ranchers is worse than the wolves, in my opinion, and it’s because the public’s been fed this fairy tale of what wolves are,” Chyenne Smith said. “And we’re the bad guys in every one of those stories.”
Jay Smith said he hasn’t seen a nickel in compensation for the livestock wolves killed.
“We have been paid for zero head ever,” he said.
Although Smith said he hasn’t been paid for any of his livestock losses, other Idaho ranchers have.

The state of Idaho has a compensation program to reimburse livestock owners the fair market value of animals that are killed by wolves or grizzly bears.
It applies to cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, chicken, llamas and even bees – basically any animal used for food or in food production.
From 2014 to 2022, the state of Idaho’s livestock compensation program paid out $687,029.50 to 299 different livestock producers for compensation for verified livestock losses, state records show.
But to be paid, livestock owners must have a confirmed wolf kill claim filed with the Office of Species Conservation each year.
“In the topography we run in, we can’t find them in time,” Smith said. “They just simply don’t come home. We’ll find a pile of bones. We’ll find wolf scat right on top of those bones. I mean, we know what happened to them. But as far as Wildlife Services coming in and being able to make a confirmation report to send to the Office of Species Conservation to put us in the reimbursement program, we are zero for 200. That’s our batting average.”
State records show that most investigations of wolf complaints don’t conclude that wolves were definitely responsible.
From July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, Idaho Wildlife Services investigated 99 complaints of livestock losses blamed on wolves, state records show. About 28% of those investigations ruled wolves’ responsibility for livestock deaths were “confirmed” or “probable.”
But more than two-thirds of the wolf complaints, about 68%, were classified as “possible/unknown.” In some cases, wolves may have eaten the carcass of livestock after the animal was already dead but did kill the animal.
Smith said his losses add up.
“We have lost over 200 head of livestock in that 20-plus years to wolves,” Jay Smith said.
“One year we’ll lose 20 head of cattle, and one year we’ll lose zero,” he added. “And we just never quite know how to explain or how to do better, or how to mitigate that risk. It’s very variable, and it’s very unknown. But it’s remained over the years. It hasn’t gone away. It sounds like it’s come and gone, but the wolves are still back there.”
And even if wolves don’t kill livestock like cows and sheep, even the presence of wolves can distress animals enough that they aren’t as healthy and wouldn’t be worth as much at market.
But wolf supporters say the number of livestock killed is extremely low. In Idaho, Montana and Wyoming wolves are confirmed to have killed an average of less than 300 domestic animals per year – out of 6 million cows and sheep in those states.



But even if the overall numbers and percentages are low, the cost is high for the farming and ranching families like the Smiths.
With 30 years of experience since reintroduction and all the claims made by wolf advocates and all the meetings with the feds, nothing has changed Smith’s mind about wolves.
He opposed reintroducing wolves, and now that they are here, Smith thinks there are too many of them. As a result, he thinks ranchers should be given broad authority to kill wolves to protect their livestock.
And as the chairman of his local county’s Republican Party central committee, Smith has helped make that happen. He said he co-wrote a 2021 state law that helped make it easier to kill more wolves by expanding when and how they can be hunted and trapped.
The law allows hunters to purchase an unlimited number of wolf tags to kill wolves and makes trapping on private land legal year round.
“There’s still people vehemently against every proposal we have,” Smith said. “And I don’t know why. We’re not out to kill them all. We’re just out to make a living and keep our livelihoods.”
Chyenne Smith agreed.
“It’s about not being able to do everything we can to protect what’s ours when we need to,” she said.
 The role trapping plays in the wolf v. livestock debate

When there are problems with wolves harassing or killing livestock, ranchers often call on trappers to catch the predators.
And one of the best people at trapping wolves is Rusty Kramer.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He’s the president of the Idaho Trappers Association and the incoming president of the National Trappers Association.
Whether it’s badgers, beavers, bobcats, coyotes, foxes, muskrats or wolves, if it’s legal to trap in Idaho, Kramer has probably caught it.
Depending on the animals, he’s used scent lures, bait or even blind set traps, hoping to entice an animal to step on a silver dollar-sized pan, which triggers the trap’s jaws to lose around the wolf’s foot and seize hold.
Once a wolf is trapped, Kramer shoots it behind the shoulder with his .22 magnum pistol, killing it. Since wolves were reintroduced, he’s trapped and killed 25 to 30.
Kramer was born and raised in Fairfield, Idaho, near the Sawtooth National Forest in central Idaho.
“I just learned how to trap looking over my dad’s shoulder and riding around with him and just kind of fell in love with it as a kid and I’ve been doing it ever since,” Kramer said.
It started as damage control, trapping ground squirrels and marmots, also known as rock chucks, to protect the alfalfa. Later, he moved on to coyotes and muskrats.
Kramer’s father taught him how to process and sell the pelts, stressing the importance of using every part of the animal. As a kid, the pelts put a little extra money in his pocket.
For him, trapping is a way of life and a family tradition.
Today, Kramer said the Idaho Trappers Association runs the largest fur sale in the United States, in Glenns Ferry, where a trapper can make good money for a wolf pelt.

A quality wolf pelt can go for $500 or more.
For 10 years as an adult, Kramer lived in Boise – the state’s largest city – about a 90-minute drive from Fairfield. After Micron Technology laid him off, Kramer returned to Fairfield.
But it’s tough to make a living on trapping alone, and Kramer also runs an alfalfa farm and is the watermaster for his local water district.

It’s the farm where Kramer and other farmers run into trouble with wolves. Ever since wolves came back, Kramer says, a lot more elk are hanging out in the valley where he and many other farmers grow alfalfa. He says the elk hang out there to keep safe from wolves, who tend to avoid agricultural areas because of the human presence. The elk trample the fields and eat the alfalfa, creating a headache and a cost for Rusty.
“I don’t hate wolves,” Kramer said. “I very (much) admire wolves. How far they can roam and how cunning they are and survive out there.”
But he thinks it was a mistake to reintroduce wolves to Idaho.
“I’m under the opinion it would be cool to snap your fingers and it’s back to ‘Dances with Wolves’ days,” Kramer said, referring to the 1990 movie starring Kevin Costner. “You know, where it’s buffalo from Ohio to Oregon and grizzlies and wolves. But there’s only so many places that grizzlies, wolves and buffalo can have in the 21st century, because they just roam so far. These aren’t foxes and coyotes that can live around humans.”
“There’s just not enough space for them in the 21st century, in my opinion,” Kramer said.
 Does Idaho’s Wood River Wolf Project offer a solution to protecting livestock from wolves?

Suzanne Asha Stone is trying to to demonstrate that ranchers can live side-by-side with wolves today.
Thirty years ago, Stone was an intern working on the wolf reintroduction project. Since then, she’s become a prominent wolf expert and advocate.
She is the executive director of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and a co-founder of the Wood River Wolf Project in Idaho.

Lately, Stone has been focusing on helping ranchers protect sheep and cattle without killing wolves.
Stone said the catalyst for the work was a “train wreck” of conflict between wolves and sheep in 2007 in central Idaho’s Blaine County.
Unaware that wolves were denning with pups in the area, a rancher let out his flock of sheep with some livestock guardian dogs for protection, Stone said.
“So to wolves, having those dogs come in meant that they had strange wolves coming in and were a significant threat to their pups,” Stone said. “The rancher, of course, didn’t know this. He had no idea that the wolves were there. But within 24 hours, we had dead sheep, dead livestock guardian dogs and a (wolf) pack with a death warrant on their head.”
Stone said the community came together after the event to look for a way to project sheep and wolves.
“It was at that time that the residents of Blaine County pushed back hard and said, ‘We really enjoy having wolves here. We had our own little Yellowstone happening right in our backyard, where we could go out and watch these wolves and their pups, and we want to keep them alive,’” Stone said.
From there, Stone sat down at the table with ranchers in the area, as well as an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services.
Stone said just about everyone was skeptical, even wolf biologists who wanted to keep more wolves alive.
“And so we sat down with all of them and then reached out to the ranchers and just said, ‘Let us try these nonlethal tools. Now everybody’s telling us we’re going to fail, but let’s try and see what happens,’” Stone said.
Stone started using something called fladry.
It’s nothing more than a barrier of waving flags, but it has proven successful to deter wolves in Eastern Europe and help sell high-mileage Hondas stateside.
“It looks like the flagging that sits around used car lots, basically,” Stone said. “It doesn’t look intimidating to us at all. Wolves don’t like it. They don’t trust it. And so we were able to keep the sheep behind those fladry pens for the rest of the season without having a single other loss. And the wolves were right there raising their pups for a good part of that summer. No more incidents at all.”
Stone’s critics called it beginner’s luck and questioned whether she could replicate her results over long periods of time or large areas.
That led to the creation of the Wood River Wolf Project, which for the last 17 summers has been partnering with ranchers in the area to use non-lethal tools and techniques to protect sheep from wolves.
The project area covers about 4,600 square miles of rugged, mountainous terrain.

Stone says there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to wolf conflicts – different terrain, different predator behavior, even varying access to electricity can affect what works. So, she’ll try just about anything – and her group has over the years. They’ve used solar-powered strobe lights, blasted air horns, played recordings of helicopters, even had cowboys play music.
In one case, wolves were feasting on llamas at an eastern Oregon ranch. So Stone’s team set up those 20-foot air dancers you see at car lots and lit them up at night.
“So when the wolves came over the top of the hill, they saw this enormous monster up there flapping around and making all kinds of noise, and oh my gosh, they were in the next county the next day,” she said.
“We’ve only lost two wolves in the 17 years now of the project and an average of less than five sheep a year for that entire 17-year period,” Stone said. “So it’s the lowest loss of livestock to wolves in any area where wolves and livestock overlap in the Western United States, probably beyond that. It’s a very successful project, and we use less money than what they do to kill wolves outside of the project area, where they’re losing more livestock there.”
But Stone hasn’t convinced everyone. In fact, one key holdout is her own state government.
Even when nonlethal methods of wolf control are available, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s written policy preference is to kill wolves to reduce the overall wolf population in the state.
“A lot of what we’ve learned here is being applied in countries all over the world, just not in the state of Idaho, and not to any real extent beyond our project area, because the state is so determined to kill wolves rather than to live with them,” Stone said.



Coming next week in Howl: Part 5, Ghost Wolves
Some experts say states are cooking the books on wolf numbers and that the anti-wolf forces are winning. Idaho Department of Fish and Game wolf counting methods have come under scrutiny by outside researchers, and some of the original people who helped bring wolves back 30 are worried the work they do could be undone.

(Photo courtesy of the Dodge County YMCA)For months child care providers and their allies campaigning for direct financial support from Wisconsin lawmakers have highlighted employers and the economy as central to their pitch.
Child care providers are “the workforce behind the workforce” in one of the rallying slogans of the provider-parent coalition Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN).
Employers and business owners themselves, however, have largely stayed in the background — from time to time offering testimonials about their employees’ need for child care, but rarely weighing in on policy alternatives.
Last week more than 75 business leaders broke that pattern, sending a letter to members of the Wisconsin Legislature.
“Wisconsin’s lingering child care crisis … cannot go unaddressed any longer by state legislators, because Wisconsin remains at a workforce crossroads that presents significant, pressing challenges for businesses and the economic vitality of the state,” the group wrote.
“We therefore ask you to advance a significant long-term state investment in child care in the 2025-27 state budget because inaction will further shutter child care programs and continue to hamper efforts to stabilize and grow Wisconsin’s workforce.”
The letter was distributed with the help of the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association (WECA), which provides advocacy and professional services for child care providers and also conducts policy research.
Campaign continues for direct subsidy
The letter embraces what Gov. Tony Evers, child care providers and their allies have been seeking in the 2025-27 Wisconsin budget this year: A direct state subsidy for child care providers. Evers and providers have warned that without that kind of support there’s likely to be a drastic shutdown of child care centers across the state in the coming months.
“Child care programs operate on razor-thin margins with budgets balanced on parent fees, which, despite being costly for families, do not cover the full cost of programs providing high-quality care,” the letter states.
“As employers, we have explored and implemented different local initiatives to help grow access to care,” it adds. Nevertheless, “those solutions are limited and must be complemented with a long-term, significant investment of state revenue.”
Tracy Propst, the executive director of the Beaver Dam Chamber of Commerce, helped organize support for and signed the business letter.
“I really do believe child care is part of an economic strategy,” Propst told the Wisconsin Examiner. “If you don’t have access to abundant and economical child care, you are going to lose workforce.”
Mary Vogl-Rauscher, a human resources consultant in Beaver Dam, joined the letter along with businesses she works with.
Prospective fee hikes are “enough of an increase, if we don’t get the subsidies, to take people out of the workforce,” Vogl-Rauscher said. “From an employer perspective and a business perspective, if [the cost of care] goes up and we don’t continue with the state subsidies, it’s going to make an even bigger economic impact.”
Vogl-Rauscher is active in the local and state chapters of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) and organized a community discussion of the issue this spring. 
Propst and Vogl-Rauscher both say they’ve sought to persuade their local Assembly member, state Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam), the Joint Finance Committee’s co-chair, that the lawmakers should add the subsidy program into the budget. 
“I’ve had conversations with Mark,” Propst said, adding that he told her that the committee was “doing something,” although not what she had asked for. “He will listen to his constituents,” she said. 
Middle-class squeeze
Both Propst and Vogl-Rauscher said their conversations with Dirk Langfoss, CEO of the Dodge County YMCA and a board member at the Beaver Dam chamber, were instrumental in clarifying the problem.
The Dodge County Y has the largest child care program in the county. Langfoss told the Wisconsin Examiner that competition for employees with other businesses has produced “upward pressures” on wages. The average weekly rate for infant and 1-year-old care is $253 — which adds up to $13,000 for all 52 weeks in the year. Rates are lower for older age groups.
“The middle-income families are the ones that are getting squeezed,” he said, with some telling him now that “they are strapped.”
If subsidies end entirely and the Y has to raise its rates, “those families are going to have to make some very hard decisions,” Langfoss added.
Propst views a direct investment now as a step toward something more comprehensive. “It’s really about child care stabilization,” she said, allowing providers to get their footing.
She also considers the immediate situation to be urgent, and fears the urgency hasn’t gotten through to many people.
“I just think this has snuck up on the businesses,” Propst said. “Like they weren’t aware this is happening, and here we are. And they don’t realize the ramifications of what’s going to happen — and that’s child care closures, child care price increases, and we’re not going to have enough providers.”
Direct investment divisions persist
While child care advocates have been arguing for a direct investment for years, the argument hasn’t fully caught on with the broader public or in the business community.
Among business leaders and the public, “there is a general recognition that child care is essential for workers, especially those that are taking care of young children,” said David Celata, vice president of policy and research for the Greater Milwaukee Foundation. But the true cost of care and why most working families can’t afford it is “an incredibly complex issue,” Celata told the Wisconsin Examiner.
“The numbers really don’t add up until we recognize that there is a social and economic good related to child care that we are failing collectively to truly maximize,” he said. “That then requires some sort of a public investment to strengthen the infrastructure of our child care sector.”
In Wisconsin the campaign for a state child care subsidy has been underway since the 2023-25 budget after monthly grants from federal COVID-19 pandemic relief funds helped child care providers raise wages without having to increase the fees families paid.
The Legislature’s Republican majority turned aside attempts to continue the subsidy program, Child Care Counts, with state money in the 2023-25 budget. Evers subsequently redirected other federal funds to extend the program at reduced rates through the middle of 2025.
The last of those funds will run out by early July. A survey that the University of Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty released in April found that as many as one in four child care providers said they might shut down without the continued support. Anywhere from half to two-thirds of programs forecast fee increases.
Evers put a $480 million proposal for a state-funded Child Care Counts program in his 2025-27 budget. Republicans on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee removed it from the budget along with more than 600 other proposals Evers included before beginning work on their own version of the document.
After visiting a child care center in Waukesha County on Monday to highlight his subsidy proposal, Evers told reporters that he would not sign a budget this year without direct child care support. Evers said the provision was part of his ongoing budget negotiations with the Legislature’s GOP leaders.
Direct funding is still a sticking point, however.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) told reporters Tuesday that Republicans are open to working with Evers on child care but remain firmly opposed to “writing checks out to providers.”

(Getty Images)Indiana youth tobacco use plummeted to its lowest levels in decades, but flavored products and nicotine dependency in youth still pose serious concerns according to the 2024 Indiana Youth Tobacco Survey released Tuesday. 
Since 2000, the Indiana Department of Health has surveyed over 4,800 public middle and high school students every two years to monitor tobacco trends. The 2024 results show the lowest cigarette use in the past two decades – dropping from 31.6% in 2000 to less than a percent.
E-cigarette use among high school students has also fallen to 5%, the lowest rate since Indiana began data collection for e-cigarettes in 2012. Despite progress, e-cigarettes remain the most commonly used tobacco product among youth. Approximately 15,000 high school students and 5,000 middle school students said they currently use them.

Nearly half of high schoolers who vape reported using e-cigarettes frequently, which is considered 20 or more days in the past 30 days. One in three middle and high school students said they experienced strong cravings or felt a strong desire to use a tobacco product. 
The report also found an increase in oral nicotine pouch use. While still less commonly used than vaping, the percentage of high schoolers who reported trying nicotine pouches doubled – from 2.3% in 2022 to 5% in 2024. These popular pouches contain nicotine, flavorings and other ingredients marketed as an alternative to traditional products. 
In 2020, the legal purchasing age for tobacco changed from 18 to 21 in Indiana. However, in 2024, 49% of high school students thought it would be somewhat or very easy to get tobacco products if they wanted some. 
Findings also noted marijuana use, though fewer students reported currently using the illicit drug. Less than 5%, or 4.6%, of middle school students reported trying marijuana, compared to 13.3% of high school students. Over 4% of high school students reported current use and many reported dual use of tobacco and marijuana. 
The report reveals that roughly one in three students live with someone who uses tobacco products – likely influencing future use in youth. About 25% of youth who have never used tobacco said they are susceptible to smoking in the future. 
Although Indiana’s youth tobacco use remains below national averages, health officials say more work is needed to protect Hoosiers from tobacco usage.
“Comprehensive tobacco control programs remain essential to reducing youth tobacco use,” Indiana Department of Health director of Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Miranda Spitznagle, said. “By working together — parents, schools, healthcare providers, and community organizations — we can continue protecting young Hoosiers from the harms of commercial tobacco products.”
Youth who are interested in quitting e-cigarettes can text INDIANA to 873373, while parents, educators and healthcare providers can visit in.gov/vapefreeindiana for resources to help prevent youth tobacco use.

Until that happens, water affordability advocates are asking appropriators in the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives for $60 million in the next state budget to support water assistance programs across the state.
The pending Senate package and the budget request were up for discussion Tuesday before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Human Services as the chamber worked to finalize its 2025 fiscal year budget. The slow pace of their budget work has been a point of contention between the House and the Democratic-led Senate, which is ready to begin negotiations.
State Rep. John Roth (R-Interlochen), the subcommittee’s chair, expressed his willingness to cut water affordability appropriations in the next budget while dining with fellow Michigan Republicans in Mackinaw City earlier this month.
On Tuesday, Maggie Pallone of Public Sector Consultants presented a report to the subcommittee on the history of water assistance programs in Michigan and the potential need for a new statewide program. Pallone said there was a significant need for a program that addresses all Michiganders’ water access needs that “doesn’t know zipcode,” and recognizes that this is an issue for families of all sizes and ages.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Michigan Legislature has in the past given one-time dollars to water assistance programs, with $25 million allocated in the 2020 fiscal year, $60 million in 2024 fiscal year and $10 million to be disbursed this year.
The Senate’s appropriators are seeking to raise total water affordability spending to $13 million for next fiscal year.
Meanwhile, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) and other senators reintroduced legislation in April that would ensure access to clean water. The package includes Senate Bill 248, Senate Bill 249, Senate Bill 250, Senate Bill 251, Senate Bill 252 and Senate Bill 253. It has bipartisan support, with state Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) as a key sponsor.
Pallone said there were local programs offering the same protections and services, but there have been problems implementing them in certain areas of the state.
Of the 4.1 million total households in Michigan, at least 1.2 million of them were 200% below the federal poverty level, with an average $47,800 annual income. The median household income in Michigan is $71,149, and the average monthly total water bill is around $84, Pallone said.
When Public Sector Consultants was hired to chart the need for water assistance programs in the state to assist Chang in craft the water affordability bills in previous sessions, the firm found that 371,522 households couldn’t afford to pay for water and that their water bills were more than 2% to 3% of their annual income.
She noted that even Birmingham, which is typically regarded as a wealthier community, qualifies for some of the programs being discussed.
Lawmakers push for action on revamped water affordability bills during lame duck session

Sara Rubino, representing the Michigan section of the American Water Works Association, said Michigan communities are facing a difficult reality as the cost of providing safe and reliable drinking water rises with households unable to keep pace.
Upgrades to statewide water systems are needed to do that, but those also come at a cost, Rubino said. Since local water systems are supported by local customer fees and rates, and not county or state dollars, those most affected by rising rates are families on fixed or limited incomes, like senior citizens.
The Michigan section of the American Water Works Association helped craft the Senate’s water affordability package and Rubino said it supports the package as a long-term solution with a sustainable funding mechanism. She added that the package offered a fiscally responsible and commonsense approach that builds a bridge between household affordability and system sustainability.
“Safe water service is just as essential to life and public health as electricity and gas,” Rubino said.
The Senate has not yet scheduled a committee hearing on the legislative package, but until then, Rubino asked Roth’s committee to support a $60 million one-time allocation to water affordability programs in the next budget to ensure those services continue.
State Rep. Kimberly Edwards (D-Eastpointe) asked Jasmine Carson, executive director of the Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency, what happens to families if money for programs already funded by the Legislature dry up.
Carson said if those families are experiencing an active water crisis, they could face additional health risks and housing instability. She later added that the situation also contributes to factors of homelessness.
Changes to Senate legislation include local opt-out
Roth said his committee was still working on the policy side of the equation with Chang on the Senate bills, which included making sure the committee had all the available information on what’s in the bills this time around.
Debra Pospiech, a member of the water affordability stakeholder group working with the Detroit Water and Sewage Department, said one of the major changes to the Senate package from last session is that the money will stay within four existing MDHHS regions. Another big change is that the monthly fee proposed in the legislation was reduced to $1.25, and will increase by 25 cents each year if the need is still there to cover the cost of the program.
A third change is an opt out provision for local communities, which was raised earlier in the hearing by Roth. Those communities can opt out to start their own program and keep that $1.25 fee within their own system’s provider charge.
Pospiech also spoke to the need for a statewide water assistance program. She noted that without an appropriation to tide systems and local programs over until the Senate bills move, water providers have three options when someone doesn’t pay their bills: they can put a tax lien on a resident’s home, shut the water off or sue the customer.
“For some families, none of those options will work, and the water provider has an uncollectible customer there,” Pospiech said. “They have choices to make. It’s either use one of those three options, or that debt just keeps accruing and they have to make some tough decisions when it’s time for increasing rates the following year.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8370-scaled-e1744389791409-1024x922.jpeg,,,2025-06-25 07:05:41.086401

If Wyoming's congressional delegation continues to follow Trump's zeal to sell public lands in the West, they’ll face a political firestorm, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Tread lightly on our public land, politicians! appeared first on WyoFile .","Even smart politicians make stupid mistakes. That’s how they lose political power; that’s how they get un-elected.

Opinion

Here’s how it happens. An elected official deludes himself or herself into thinking they are unassailable, that their seat is safe because they’ve never been seriously challenged. This is political hubris and leads to mistakes. They finally cross a line, push the envelope too far and run into political Kryptonite.
Those officials’ hubris reaches the point where they tell their constituents, “We don’t give a rat’s ass what you think, we’re gonna do what we want.” This attitude toward their jobs and their constituents is the graveyard of political ambition.
All three members of our Wyoming congressional delegation are smart politicians. Their election records bear this out. But they are going down a path that will end up in their political doom. So we should give them fair warning.
Perhaps the clearest warning that our delegation could receive is a reminder of what happened to U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, an outcome that they themselves, to one extent or another, contributed to. Cheney’s seat seemed secure and her popularity bulletproof until she acted in a way that was intolerable to Wyoming’s electorate. Voters turned on Cheney as quickly as a striking rattlesnake, and her political career in the Cowboy State came to an abrupt end.
U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, and Rep. Harriet Hageman, through their unwavering support for Trump, seemingly enjoy secure places in Wyoming politics. But if they slavishly follow Trump in his zeal to sell public lands in the West, they’ll face a political firestorm every bit as hot as the one that scorched Cheney.
Maybe they misread the room and don’t grasp how their constituents feel about the half of the Big Empty that is in public lands. Sure, we cuss federal land management agencies up one side and down the other. We were taught that by our parents and grandparents. But they also taught us that we can hunt, fish, camp, rockhound and generally goof around on our public land without having to beg permission from anyone.
The public domain in Wyoming is interwoven into the fabric of our land ethic, an ethic that is passed down from one generation to another. It is, quite simply, how we think of ourselves and the landscape around us. It’s how we think of our home.
When politicians — whether our own representatives or an eastern businessman like Trump — try to tell us that we are wrong, then we get pissed off. When they say that large swaths of our home should be sold to the highest bidder, our bullshit detectors go off and our hackles go up. And then we vote. Just ask Cheney.
The public land issue cuts across partisan boundaries and bridges demographics in Wyoming. It is where the right wing and the left wing meet on common ground. For a politician to ignore or discount the depth of this ethos in the electorate is a grave mistake. To call it a silly overreaction is political suicide.
I think our delegation is feeling the hot blast of pushback against Trump’s misguided notion of disposing of public land in Wyoming. And that pushback is coming from folks who, up until now, thought our delegation could do no wrong. I think it’s dawning on them that this is a Rubicon they can’t cross if they want to keep their election certificates.
It will be instructive to watch how the delegation deals with this crisis.
I’d suggest that they pay close attention to the rally that will be held at the Wyoming Capitol at 6 p.m., Thursday. They should keep a head count of the number of their constituents protesting the sale of our public land and compare that with the number of Wyomingites carrying signs that say, “Hell yeah. Sell it all.”
If they can’t read the room, and they call the protest a silly overreaction, I guess they can wait to look at the numbers in the next election. The choice is theirs.
But smart politicians who can sense their neighbors’ anger, and who are willing to stand their ground against bone-headed ideas like privatizing Wyoming’s public land, can smell political blood in the water. They’re flexing their muscles to run against our complacent incumbents. Here endeth the lesson.

Wyoming is many things to many people, but public land is why they come and why they stay, writes guest columnist Chris Madson.
The post Public land — land of the free — defines Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","I wasn’t born in Wyoming, but, as the old saying goes, “I got here as soon as I could.” For me, that was August of 1960 when my parents packed up the kids and headed west from St. Louis, a station-wagon version of Lewis and Clark. On our way home from the Pacific, we bent south, like William Clark, and found ourselves along his fork of the Yellowstone River in the Sunlight Basin. I was not quite 10 years old, and the North Absarokas were an obsidian-tipped arrow straight into my soul.

Opinion

Up until that week, my idea of freedom was a hundred acres of timber along a creek that cut its way down a steep valley through the bluffs of the Mississippi, dove into a culvert under a four-lane highway, and found its way down the rip-rapped bank to join the Father of Waters. It was a marvelous place for a bunch of suburban kids — oak, hickory and wild cherry on the uplands, giant sycamore and soft maple along the creek, whose dappled waters trickled over limestone outcrops and lingered in gravel-bottomed pools — but it was a tiny spark of wildness in a landscape that had been thoroughly settled. Even the kids knew that.
If we left the creek and climbed up toward the ridges on either side, we ran into the back fences of suburban yards, carefully mowed and festooned with “No Trespassing” signs. Now and then, an irate householder would catch a glimpse of us in the woods and yell — we disappeared into the shadows like smoke.
So the water and timber and wildflowers and snowfields and peaks of the Shoshone National Forest were like a revelation of God to me. The family came back again and again over the next several years, and I was loosed with a flyrod, four Muddler Minnows and a smashed peanut butter sandwich to follow the creek as far as curiosity and gumption would take me.
After college, I settled down in the Midwest to start a family, but every summer, I was back for as long as the company could spare me, with a wife and two apple-cheeked little girls in tow, to taste the freedom we had somehow lost back east.
Then, I had a chance to come to Wyoming full time. The offer was exhilarating, but I thought it over before I accepted, not because of what the job entailed, but because of how I felt about the West. They say familiarity breeds contempt, or at least boredom, and I wondered whether the sage and mountains might lose some of their shine for me if they were always at the back door. I decided to take the chance.
That was 1983. In the years since, I’ve rambled around most of the state, from Devil’s Tower to the Bear River Divide, Jenny Lake to Vedauwoo. I’ve hunted, fished, canoed, hiked, photographed, picnicked and contemplated my navel, and I’m pleased — and relieved — to report that the big sky has never lost its shine for me. In fact, the love affair has deepened over time as I’ve come to appreciate the subtle charms of the sage as much as the flower-strewn meadows above timberline. It wasn’t until I moved to Wyoming that I experienced September and October here, arguably the best months of the year, not only in the West but anywhere.
All of this is set against the backdrop of public land. I own 34 of the BLM’s 1:100,000-scale maps covering Wyoming, 32 of the USGS quads, and an assortment of national park and forest maps on the side, all of them dog-eared and stained from days spent crammed into backpacks. I’m proud to say I’ve worn out two compasses, something that never could have happened behind the Midwest’s fences.
Wyoming is many things to many people. The boosters tout its minerals; the politicians brag on the rugged independence of its people. But, let me tell you: public land is what defines Wyoming. It’s why I came; it’s why I stay. I think I share that sentiment with many other residents.
You hang a “No Trespassing” sign on Wyoming, and it will be no different than Illinois, with a lot less rain and much longer winters. If all I have left is the view of the Tetons from a crowded parking lot and locked gates off every highway, I can think of better places to spend my time.
Back in the 1930s, America’s poet laureate, Archibald MacLeish, looked at the state of the nation and asked a penetrating question:

We wonder whether the great American dream
Was the singing of locusts out of the grass to the west and the
West is behind us now:
The west wind’s away from us
We wonder if the liberty is done:
The dreaming is finished
Or if there’s something different men can dream
Or if there’s something different men can mean by 
Liberty . . .
Or if there’s liberty a man can mean that’s
Men: not land
We wonder
We don’t know
We’re asking

I wonder whether there’s liberty a man can mean that’s men, not land. Here in Wyoming, I think there’s little doubt. Public land means my freedom.
Don’t you sell an inch of it.

It serves immigrants with limited English knowledge, Coloradans experiencing homelessness, students pursuing careers in the trades, concurrently enrolled high schoolers and students who are the first in their family to attend college. 
That mission of accessible education guides Adriana Cordova, CCA’s academic advising director, in her work. A CCA graduate herself, Cordova knows what it’s like to be nervous and at times lost in college.
“I’m a first-generation student, and I migrated here in 2003 from Sonora, Mexico. The expectation was always for me to go to school, and it wasn’t easy,” said Cordova, who graduated in 2017 and went on to earn bachelor’s and master’s degrees. “At CCA, I was able to get a hang of what college was.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Part of what has made CCA feel like home for Cordova is the diversity and welcoming environment she said she has experienced at the college. 
Some of the resources that support the CCA community, including peer instructors, college readiness programming and faculty training workshops, are funded by the federal government through a $2.5 million grant, distributed over six years. The college was eligible for the grant because it is a federally-designated Hispanic-serving institution — one of 16 in Colorado and 615 in the United States. But now federal grants for such institutions could be at risk.
Colorado’s Hispanic-serving institutions range from community colleges in the suburbs of Denver to regional public universities nestled up north in Greeley and south in Alamosa County along the Rio Grande. They vary in size and focus, but they all enroll at least 25% Hispanic students and serve a high proportion of low-income students. 
Federal lawsuit raises discrimination concerns
The federal Hispanic-serving institution designation is in the spotlight with a recently filed federal lawsuit in Tennessee that argues these programs unconstitutionally discriminate based on ethnicity. The lawsuit, filed by the state of Tennessee and the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, “is about ensuring that opportunity is extended to everyone on an equal basis,” according to a statement from Students for Fair Admissions. 
Students for Fair Admissions declined an interview request for this article but referred to the written statement. The lawsuit argues that the federal Department of Education’s Hispanic-serving institution program discriminates against institutions and students in Tennessee, a state that has no colleges with such designation. While many colleges in Tennessee serve some low-income and Hispanic students, none meets the 25% threshold. 
“A federal grant system that openly discriminates against students based on ethnicity isn’t just wrong and un-American—it’s unconstitutional,” Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement.

The federal government awarded slightly more than $228 million to Hispanic-serving institutions in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Although the money goes specifically toward Hispanic-serving institutions, each institution must use its grants for programs and services that are open to all of its students, regardless of race or ethnicity. 
Gina Garcia, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, studies higher education issues and has published extensive research on Hispanic-serving institutions. Garcia cautioned that a loss of these federal grants could be “devastating” to these institutions, which typically use the money for student support and innovation.
“These are capacity-building grants, and what that means is that they do not allow you to give any of the funding or any of the opportunities specifically to one group, because the money goes to the institution, to make the institution better, and so anything the institution does is going to be for every student,” Garcia said. 
‘Safety and support’ for students
Julianna Montoya graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver last month, with a major in public health, two minors in biology and pre-health care and a concentration in community health education. In the fall, the first-generation college student will pursue a master’s in public health at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
Attending a Hispanic-serving institution allowed her to “find safety and support as a Latina.” 
“I entered college with a million nerves about navigating the higher education system,” Montoya said. “I came in with my sister who is 16 months older than me, and we were really trying to figure out who we are as individuals. She and my peers here have been a support for me.”
What most stood out to Montoya was taking a health care ethics class with a Latino professor who “walked in with his marginalized identity, as well as his background as a professional in the field.”










If you were a student here and you had a teacher’s assistant in your class, you benefited from these grants.


– Manuel Del Real, of Metropolitan State University of Denver


MSU, which has 16,500 total undergraduates, became a Hispanic-serving institution in 2019, after a 12-year process that focused on recruitment, retention and data collection.
In 2007, the university enrolled 13% Hispanic students. Now that number is 37%. Since becoming a Hispanic-serving institution, it has received $14 million in federal grants.
Manuel Del Real, MSU’s executive director of Hispanic-serving institution initiatives and inclusion, said the designation has been helpful to “communicate that we are here for our students.” He emphasized that the grants are beneficial to all MSU students, whether they are Hispanic or not. 
“If you were a student here and you had a teacher’s assistant in your class, you benefited from these grants,” he said.
Del Real said he is not focused on the ongoing federal lawsuit by Students for Fair Admissions because “even if the designation goes away, we’re still going to stick to our mission and values.”
“Yes, we’re thankful for getting these grants,” Del Real said. “But whatever happens, we’re going to continue being an institution that’s minority serving, and that continues to serve all of our students.”
Achievement gaps persist
The federal Hispanic-serving institution designation was created in 1992, stemming from concerns that Hispanic students were largely enrolled in colleges and universities with poor educational outcomes and low government funding.
Between the years 2000 and 2020, Hispanic post-baccalaureate enrollment has tripled in the U.S., according to the Postsecondary National Policy Institute. However, enrollment and degree completion gaps remain. In Colorado, the four-year graduation rate for Hispanic students is 44%, compared to 59% for white students, according to the nonprofit Excelencia in Education.

These inequalities are why Hispanic-serving institution grants and designations matter, said Angela Marquez, the vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion and chief of staff at Community College of Aurora.
“We want to be culturally responsive and create a classroom environment that is optimal for the success of our Latino and Latina students, and for the unique needs of all of our students,” Marquez said.
For Cordova, supporting students means connecting them with resources that span beyond academic support, including food assistance, counseling and housing services.
“We don’t just help them get signed up for classes,” Cordova said. “We ask, ‘What’s going on with work? What’s going on with family?’ We want them to graduate, but we treat them like humans in the process.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Republicans in North Carolina’s legislature are split on the details of hurricane relief for the western mountains.
Almost a month ago, the House approved a new round of aid as the region continued to rebuild from Hurricane Helene. That aid bill then sat frozen for a month — until Monday. Senators fast-tracked it and sent it back to the House, with major changes.
The last-minute Senate markup threw a wrench into plans to approve the aid before the legislature leaves Raleigh this week. The House on Tuesday unanimously voted to reject those changes, forcing lawmakers to go to a conference committee and iron out a compromise.
“To the surprise of probably no one in this room, it made some significant changes, many of which are important to the people of western North Carolina,” said Rep. Dudley Greene (R-Avery). “We’ve been working feverishly to try and digest, and get our heads around, some of these changes.”
Greene said he was hopeful that the chambers could meet in conference “as early as this week.” But it could also come later.
A Democrat from the Asheville area urged his colleagues to back the House’s rejection Tuesday.
“This bill is certainly a much worse version than we sent over,” said Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe). “I look forward to making it better.”
In a statement Tuesday, Gov. Josh Stein urged lawmakers to swiftly meet in conference.
“Western North Carolina cannot afford for process to get in the way of progress,” Stein said. “The legislature should work quickly this week to set aside their differences and do their job to support folks rebuilding after Helene. I stand ready to get this sorely needed relief out the door.”



The broad strokes of both chambers’ relief plans are similar. Both set up the state for more reimbursement from federal aid programs. They send bundles of money to local governments to help with ongoing repairs and projects, and to help rebuild private roads and bridges.
But several key line-items are changed or removed altogether between the two plans. And the ways in which the spending is sourced vary.
The Senate’s plan is more expansive than the House’s. It sends $700 million to the state’s Helene fund and spends $480 million of that money. (The rest would sit in the Helene fund, available for further aid down the line.) It lays out hundreds of millions of dollars for federal water and sewer projects, and steers another nearly half a billion of already appropriated money toward Helene-related road and bridge repairs.
The House’s bill allocates $464 million, and also sets out the hundreds of millions of federal dollars for water projects.
Among the biggest omissions in the Senate’s proposal: a $60 million grant program for small businesses.
That program, a longtime request from western lawmakers and advocates, was scratched. Republicans are citing the state constitution’s “emoluments clause,” saying such a program would be unconstitutional. Some Democrats are dubious of that argument — and so is the House Republicans’ leader.
“I have a different legal opinion on it, obviously,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters Tuesday evening. “We do things all the time to help folks who have suffered in a disaster. We do it a lot in agriculture in this state. So, I just simply disagree.”
Local governments in western North Carolina, many of whom are facing budget shortfalls, would see aid in both plans, though the details vary.
The House plan would send out $15 million for debris removal, and $5 million for tech assistance. And the Senate bill sends a new bundle of $100 million to an interest-free loan program run by the state treasurer’s office.
A $25 million, three-year farm infrastructure recovery program established in the House plan is absent from the Senate’s. Instead, the Senate plan lays out $8 million for a program focused on agricultural manufacturing and processing.
Both plans also include money to repair damages to school facilities and UNC System campuses.
The two plans also differ greatly in where they pull money to fund their aid from.
The House bill claws back money from NC Innovation, a private research nonprofit.
And the Senate plan pulls from a variety of reserve funds, while redirecting over half a billion dollars already allocated to transportation maintenance and local aid. That move has sparked concern among Democrats, and is also expected to be a primary point of discussion with House Republicans.
The legislature has thus far appropriated $1.4 billion in state dollars to Helene recovery. Lawmakers are expected to leave Raleigh for an extended period after this week.
“I will say that the chairs of each side on that issue continue to talk,” Hall said. “So I think they’re relatively close to getting something done. Whether we end up passing that this week or when we come back, not clear yet.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 07:05:41.086401

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13 before Abrego Garcia's arraignment on federal charges. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia is due to appear in a downtown Nashville courtroom today for a hearing scheduled to set conditions for his release pending trial on human smuggling charges.
Federal prosecutors, however, continue to fight for him to be detained. On Sunday a federal magistrate judge issued an order dismissing claims that Abrego posed a flight risk or danger to the community. Prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to challenge the order. 
Should he be released on bond, Abrego will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and could be deported, prosecutors said.
If Abrego is deported, the United States would “lose the meaningful opportunity to try its case. This would be irreparable harm to the public,” they argued in legal filings submitted Tuesday.
Prosecutors are seeking a temporary 30-day pause on proceedings to litigate their legal claims that Abrego be detained pending trial.
Federal magistrate judge denies government’s motion to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia

Family members of Abrego Garcia are also expected to make an appearance in Nashville, joining community leaders “to address concerns over due process, advocate for vulnerable communities and demand justice for Kilmar Abrego Garcia” a news release by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition said.
Abrego, an Salvadoran national living in Maryland, has served as a symbol of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. 
A father of three and a union metal sheet apprentice with no criminal history, Abrego was sent to a Salvadoran prison in March, despite a 2019 order that allowed him to reside in the country while his immigration case was considered. The 2019 immigration order specifically barred his deportation to El Salvador, where, Abrego said, he feared gang violence. 
A federal prosecutor in Maryland conceded he had been deported in error during a hearing about Abrego’s deportation. On Tuesday, the New York Times was among the news organizations that reported the prosecutor, Erez Reuveni, filed a whistleblower complaint that alleged he was questioned by his bosses over why he had not also argued instead that Abrego was a terrorist, despite a lack of evidence. Reuveni was then placed on administrative leave when he refused to sign onto a legal brief making the same claims against Abrego. Reuveni was subsequently fired.
The Supreme Court in April ordered federal officials to facilitate Abrego’s return. It wasn’t until June 6 that he was flown to Nashville to face criminal human charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. 
Kilmar Abrego Garcia enters not guilty pleas while federal judge defers decision on his release

Prosecutors now allege the 2022 Tennessee traffic stop was part of a national smuggling scheme in which Abrego was paid to drive immigrants illegally in the country from Texas to other states. 
An agent with the Department of Homeland Security testified he began his investigation into the three-year-old traffic stop in April, while Abrego remained in the El Salvador CECOT prison and after the Supreme Court had ordered the government to facilitate his return to the United States.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Federal prosecutors in Nashville ask judge to keep Abrego Garcia detained until trial

In her order denying the prosecutors’ motion to detain Abrego, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes expressed skepticism for some of the government’s claims. 
Federal prosecutors argued that a teen boy was present with a number of Hispanic men when Abrego was pulled over for speeding in Tennessee in 2022. The presence of a minor during a crime can be legal grounds for keeping an individual detained pending trial. They also argued that Abrego was a gang member who could intimidate potential witnesses. Abrego has not been charged with crimes related to minors or gang activity.
Holmes questioned the reliability of witnesses and evidence prosecutors cited, noting that some of the individuals made deals for their own criminal and immigration cases in exchange for their testimony. She also concluded that some of the government’s claims relied on “multiple layers of hearsay.”

(Photo | Isiah Holmes)People who believe the call to action, Black Lives Matter, to be controversial and provocative should buckle up.
What we’ve been witnessing these last weeks has been a new call to action: Immigrant Lives Matter.
Yes, even undocumented immigrant lives matter.
Black Lives Matter stirred passionate backlash unlike anything I’ve seen since the 1960s. 
Immigrant Lives Matter is now a cry to recognize the humanity of people who are suffering violent attacks after being demonized as “aliens.” 
I’ve written on immigration as a reporter, columnist and editorial writer for decades. The most invective I’ve had directed my way has been about who I am as the son of immigrants.
“Go back to Mexico” was a common retort to things I wrote. Each time I’d chuckle to myself: “Hard to do since I’m from California.” 
Yup, I’m not from Mexico. But my parents were. And they lived in this country without legal status until I was in grade school.
I’m quite familiar with immigrant life, although, thanks to the 14th Amendment (also under attack by the Trump administration), I’m a citizen. 
I’ve seen up close what being afraid of deportation looks like. The fear that a family would be torn apart, loss of livelihood and loss of the country you chose to work in, pay taxes for, build a family in and the only one your children know. And, in my case as with many other immigrants and children of immigrants, the country in whose military you chose to serve.
That experience and those decades of writing on immigration taught me that among the hottest buttons around are those dealing with the border, particularly when people cross it who don’t look and talk like you. 
Standard disclaimer: You don’t have to be a racist to be concerned about immigration and immigrants, but using terms such as invasion, infestation, vermin, criminals and threat to American identity and values is a big tell.
As is calling out the military to combat a non-existent foreign invasion.
Black Lives Matter speaks to the current plight of people whose ancestors were unwilling immigrants, packed into slave ships and brought here by force. Dehumanizing racism and the shocking mistreatment of Black citizens by police has dogged our nation from the beginning.
But  even that call to action, after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, was roundly disparaged.
Wrap your head around that. Americans who have been around since the country’s founding and over whose slavery a country fought a bitter civil war are still not considered American enough to  insist on being treated as Americans.
All that immigrants and those who stand in solidarity with them are asking is that the basic precepts of fairness, humanity and, importantly, due process extend to them as well. 
Immigrants are in a vulnerable position. Demagoguing about invasion and infestation is just too tempting for nativists and opportunists who prey on prejudices for political gain.
Los Angeles has been in the news because of protests that the Trump administration has been trying very hard to depict as a violent conflagration. But the protests have been  mostly peaceful by people reasonably objecting to ICE raids. The ICE targets are people who have worked here for years, raising U.S. citizen children and doing the work Americans won’t do. 
Despite footage of “violent“ protesters cast as “invaders” faced by brave military troops, California’s governor and many others have noted that there was no widespread, destructive civil unrest, much less the foreign invasion that the demagogues claim justifies military involvement. 
Be afraid. We need to stop underestimating the appeal of nativism. It’s real in this country.
But something happened after President Trump’s unwarranted use of the military in Los Angeles and in reaction to his military parade in Washington D.C. (lightly attended, to the president’s dismay).
The “No Kings” protests. 
I saw them as solidarity with Immigrant Lives Matter.
Black lives will always matter. After the phrase was coined, some people  insisted that it meant other lives mattered less. 
Nonsense, then and now.
Immigrant lives matter, as with Black lives, as much as your life does.  And if we don’t protect the lives of the people in the crosshairs now, we all could be next.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) With control of the Virginia House of Delegates hanging in the balance, national Democrats are pumping another $400,000 into the fight — and putting their weight behind candidates they see as crucial to flipping Republican districts this November.
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), an arm of the Democratic National Committee focused on state legislative races, announced the new funding Wednesday along with a fresh slate of endorsements for candidates running in competitive districts. 
Lindsey Dougherty will challenge Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, in the 75th District. Leslie Mehta is taking on Del. Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield, in the 89th, while. May Nivar will face Del. David Owen, R-Henrico, in the 57th District. And Kacey Robins Carnegie is up against Republican Mike Lamonea for the open Hampton Roads seat in the 89th District, following Republican Del. Baxter Ennis’ decision to not to seek reelection. 
All candidates recently won contested primaries and now enter general election matchups in districts labeled “competitive” by the Virginia Public Access Project — prime battlegrounds Democrats hope to flip and Republicans aim to defend. 
Though the DLCC backs candidates nationwide, Virginia is a centerpiece of its 2025-2026 Target Map of battleground states. Other states in the mix include North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, where Democrats are looking to flip legislatures or strengthen their footholds in GOP-leaning terrain. 
“We’re backing hardworking and authentic candidates in the toughest battlegrounds who are out in their communities every day, talking to voters about how they’ll fight the chaos in Washington and put working families’ opportunities first,” DLCC President Heather Williams said in a statement. “This investment will fuel them as they continue working on the ground to protect and expand Democrats’ razor-thin majority this fall.”
The new funding is part of a seven-figure investment the DLCC plans to make in Virginia this cycle. The DNC also announced earlier this year it will transfer $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years. 
The goal, DLCC Chair Ken Martin said, is to help build a stronger Democratic bench at the state and local levels — a strategy that could also yield future candidates for Congress and beyond.
“When we organize everywhere to compete everywhere, we can win anywhere,” Martin said in an April press call. 
Meanwhile, the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) is sharpening its focus on Virginia and New Jersey, the two states holding gubernatorial and legislative elections this year. Virginia’s off-year elections are often viewed  as a referendum on the White House —- and with President Donald Trump back in office, the RSLC is warning against a repeat of the 2017 Democratic wave. 
In a recent memo, the organization noted that Virginia has a history of electing governors from the party opposite the sitting president — a trend Republicans are eager to break this year.
To that end, the RLCC and the House Republican Campaign Committee have launched two six-figure digital ad campaigns. Republicans are also embracing early and mail-in voting to mobilize low-propensity voters — a shift encouraged by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, despite past GOP resistance to expanded absentee voting laws.

Wilder Youth Development Center in West Tennessee is slated to be built. (Photo: Google Earth)Tennessee is planning to build a juvenile detainment facility for pre-adjudication in West Tennessee even as it spends hundreds of millions reconstructing two facilities, all while the state is mired in a lawsuit alleging mistreatment of youth offenders.
Republican Sen. Ed Jackson of Jackson said Tuesday he supports construction of a detention center on a Madison County site being purchased next to Jackson’s criminal justice center where minors would be held until their cases go through juvenile courts across the western part of the state. The facility could cost $45 million to $55 million, but some local governments are willing to chip in, according to Jackson.
Lawmakers passed legislation this year requiring a study of the state’s juvenile detention and treatment facilities to determine whether another center is merited. The report by the Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is expected to be finished in January 2026 to present to the legislature. But, the preliminary results appear to be clear.
“I think they found out, not just yes, but heck yes, there’s definitely a need for this in rural West Tennessee,” Jackson said.
  “Every sheriff and pretty much every juvenile judge in West Tennessee is saying we’ve got to have a place” to house juvenile offenders, said Sen. Ed Jackson, a Jackson Republican.
Outside of Memphis, only 10 beds are available in rural West Tennessee for minors awaiting adjudication for serious crimes, eight in Madison County and two in Dyer County, the senator said. 
Jackson described a situation in which Tipton County law enforcement had to hold a teenager charged with a gun-related crime in a local motel, with deputies monitoring him around the clock until his court date, because the sheriff’s office didn’t want to send him to a Memphis facility.
“Every sheriff and pretty much every juvenile judge in West Tennessee is saying we’ve got to have a place,” Jackson said.
Youthful offenders can’t be housed within hearing or eyesight of adult offenders in county jails or prisons.
State Rep. Gloria Johnson said Tuesday the state’s emphasis on toughening laws locking up minors is misplaced. Instead, Tennessee should be taking steps such as raising the minimum wage to keep teens from committing crimes, concentrating on mental health treatment and rehabilitating those who get into trouble, she said.
“I think the Tennessee Legislature is creating criminals instead of preventing them, and they just want to mass-house them. They are throwing our kids away instead of doing what’s right for them,” said Johnson, a Knoxville Democrat.
Rebuilding youth detention
The State Building Commission’s executive subcommittee this week authorized the use of a construction manager/general contractor for designing and setting a guaranteed price to build new Woodland Hills and John S. Wilder youth detention centers in Nashville and Fayette County. The projects are budgeted at a total of $333.3 million.
Those projects are moving ahead even as the state is caught in a lawsuit filed by Disability Rights Tennessee against the state, the Department of Children’s Services and the commissioners of DCS and the Department of Education in June 2024, alleging they are illegally and unconstitutionally warehousing kids with disabilities in prison-like facilities.
About 600 to 650 youth are in DCS juvenile justice custody at any one time, 1,200-1,400 annually, and an estimated 65% to 85% live with a disability, based on national data, according to Disability Rights Tennessee.










I think the Tennessee Legislature is creating criminals instead of preventing them, and they just want to mass-house them. They are throwing our kids away instead of doing what’s right for them.


– Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville


Tennessee doesn’t operate any juvenile facilities considered to be locked down, instead contracting with three Tennessee private entities for “hardware secure” facilities and another from Texas, totaling 159 beds for youths who commit serious offenses.
Thirty other facilities run by private entities provide lower level security, or secured only by personnel, similar to that at Wilder Development Center.
The year-old lawsuit details cases in which youth offenders were held in solitary confinement for months, causing them to become suicidal. It also cites the Richard L. Bean Center in Knoxville as using solitary confinement to punish youths.
Lawsuit charges Tennessee Department of Children’s Services violated kids’ constitutional rights

The lawsuit describes a 17-year-old boy beaten more than 31 times, a 15-year-old girl shackled and dragged across a floor to solitary confinement, multiple cases of pepper-spraying and situations in which “bounties” were placed on kids to induce attacks after they filed grievances against staff or complained about conditions. The filing also says packaged noodles were used to reward those who beat up other youths.
The State Building Commission’s Executive Subcommittee approved the state’s construction plan without discussion this week for Woodland Hills and Wilder facilities.
Asked if he’s concerned about the lawsuit’s allegations as the state spends heavily on new facilities, Comptroller Jason Mumpower said, “We want things to be right, both for the public and for the people who are housed there.”
Republican Rep. Jay Reedy of Erin sponsored the bill ordering a study of the state’s juvenile facilities after receiving a letter from the city of Germantown requesting more space for juvenile offenders in their region. City officials described problems with “overwhelming capacity issues” at West Tennessee detention centers and raised concerns about juvenile offenders returning to “community environments” without receiving the rehabilitation or treatment they needed.
Reedy’s bill, which was sponsored in the Senate by Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County, directs the commission to study facilities that house juvenile offenders found to be delinquent and placed in the custody of the Department of Children’s Services or who are detained by juvenile courts while waiting for hearings.

(Bob Wick/BLM/Public domain)The Trump administration’s revised Department of the Interior strategic plan calls for expanded fossil fuel development across federal lands, while omitting any reference to public land sales first raised in an earlier draft.
Required under a 1993 statute and in 2010 amendments to that law, the draft plan outlines high-level goals for Interior’s management of 480 million acres of federal land, including about 24 million acres in Colorado. Language emphasizing a commitment to extraction is particularly stark. In a break from contemporary descriptions of the natural resources under federal management, the Trump administration declared in a proposed introduction to the plan that the department “is the U.S. balance sheet, and natural resources are the country’s assets.” 
“These lands — rich in energy, minerals, biodiversity, and recreational value — are worth trillions of dollars to current and future generations,” the draft introduction continues. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Chris Winter, executive director of the University of Colorado Law School’s Getches-Wilkinson Center for Natural Resources, Energy, and the Environment, said the draft plan confirms what many in the environmental community have feared: a shift away from conservation in favor of extractive industries.
“The administration is going to emphasize extractive industries and fossil fuels on federal public lands and is going to move away from conservation and renewable energy,” he said.
The plan makes no mention of renewable energy or even of climate change, a sharp contrast from Interior’s current guiding template. The Biden-era 2022–2026 strategic plan emphasized climate resilience and a transition to clean energy. The new draft, by contrast, omits the subject of climate entirely. That is one of several breakpoints critics say reflects a reversal in federal priorities.
The absence of any mention of renewable energy in the strategic plan signals, to some experts, a deeper shift in federal priorities. Wyatt Sassman, an associate professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law who specializes in natural resources matters, thinks a federal abandonment of that imperative is already underway.
“At least some reporting has suggested that (the) Fish and Wildlife (Service) has stopped issuing permits for wind energy projects,” he said. “I don’t see any legal process for that. And it’s seemingly inconsistent with the way it’s treating fossil energy projects.”
It may undercut environmental review
President Donald Trump did not wait very long after taking office to tighten restrictions even on wind energy production that does not rely on public lands for facilities. Seventeen states, including Colorado, and the District of Columbia launched litigation May 5 in a Boston-based federal court in an attempt to prevent the administration from executing his Jan. 20 executive order that purports to halt offshore wind energy development. 
Trump’s team at Interior is expected to pursue a continued sharp reversal, facilitated by a likely attempt to deregulate oil and gas activities on Bureau of Land Management and other lands and waters under Interior’s control. Authors of the document explain that the department “will focus on expediting leases and streamlining and cutting regulations while promoting conservation.” Moreover, “by offering economic incentives and better access to energy resources, Interior will encourage private investment and create more American jobs.” 
Environmental advocates say they are not surprised by the draft plan’s focus on stimulating the national economy, but they warn that the plan may presage a determined effort to evade or undercut processes mandated in public land laws. The danger in that approach, Sassman said, is that Interior decision-makers may act in a manner that is blind to environmental consequences. “My sense is that it will get in the way of them trying to make good, well-reasoned decisions,” he said.










The thing that really concerns me is that what I'm seeing is a lot of efforts to sort of cut any type of public participation, to cut any type of perceived red tape.


– Sally Paez, attorney at New Mexico Wild


Sally Paez, a staff attorney at Santa Fe-based New Mexico Wild, warned that Interior’s language about process streamlining signals an intent to sidestep longstanding environmental review laws.
“The thing that really concerns me is that what I’m seeing is a lot of efforts to sort of cut any type of public participation, to cut any type of perceived red tape,” she said. “And, by ‘perceived red tape,’ what I mean are bedrock environmental laws that are in place to make sure that extraction is done in a way that doesn’t destroy our very limited water supplies in our arid state, and doesn’t impact big game corridors or endangered species and things like that.”
Environmental advocates warned that Interior’s approach may undercut review even under the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act. Paez called the effort “unprecedented,” citing fast-tracked reviews and diminished public comment periods.
The administration did not provide in the newest version of the draft strategic plan any details about how much additional logging Interior will seek to advance on BLM lands. A March executive order directs increased logging on BLM and Forest Service lands, and the strategic plan calls for “active timber management” to reduce wildfire risk but does not specify locations at which more timber extraction would occur or the scale of tree removal.
Grazing and mining are not specifically addressed in the May document, though the drafters note a commitment to “clean coal” and reiterate a traditional adherence to “multiple-use land management.” According to the draft plan, that approach will “ensure the country’s public lands can be used for recreation, grazing, timber sales, mining, and mineral exploration, all of which provide revenue for the U.S. government.”
Public land sales dropped 
Beyond extractive industries, the strategic plan outlines priorities for water infrastructure but avoids mention of critical regional shortages. Interior would “upgrade and maintain water infrastructure to ensure water supplies while also promoting water conservation and reuse for drought resiliency.” But there is no mention in the document of how the department would approach questions of reduced supplies in the Colorado River Basin and California rivers and, other than a nod toward hydropower as an energy source, the challenge of assuring adequate flows for wild salmon in the Columbia River system and other anadromous fish freshwater habitats.
Interior offers little detail about wildlife protection in the draft strategic plan, at least beyond mention of promoting hunting and fishing on public lands and a promise “to remove harmful invasive species, delist endangered species once recovered, and involve local communities in decisions about managing nature and wildlife.” To Winter, this lack of clarity raises a risk that Interior may fail to advance the goals of the Endangered Species Act.
“We’ve already seen very aggressive steps to roll back protections under the Endangered Species Act,” he said, pointing to a recent proposal to redefine the ESA’s definition of harm to exclude damage to vital habitats. “We suspect that the administration intends to undermine protections for wildlife moving forward.”
The draft strategic plan includes a stated goal of strengthening “government-to-government relationships with Native Americans and Insular Areas.” That objective, the document says, would involve “shared management of land, increasing investment in education and jobs programs, and managing trust assets for beneficiaries.”
However, the plan does not mention existing co-stewardship arrangements at major national monuments in the West, such as Bears Ears in Utah and Chuckwalla and Sáttítla Highlands in California. It also does not address whether those monuments will retain their protections under the Antiquities Act.
The draft strategic plan’s utilitarian perspective may nevertheless have little impact on expected legal battles over the department’s efforts during the next few years to facilitate oil, gas, and coal production and mineral exploration, logging, and grazing.
“I’ve never seen the strategic plans relied on in a legal context,” Sassman said. “There are other kinds of legal actions they will have to take in order to effectuate these goals.”
A first effort at a 2026-2030 plan, released in April, also declared that Interior’s first priority will be to “restore American prosperity.” That version, unlike the one Interior released last month, also explicitly raised the prospect of public land sales. Winter said that the exclusion of that idea from the new rendering should not be taken as a signal that the administration has abandoned the proposition. 
“I don’t think the administration is backing away from that idea,” he said. “This issue is being taken up by Congress as part of the (budget) reconciliation process and this is really an issue that will be determined by Congress and not by the department because that’s where the authority lies.” 
The public will have an opportunity to comment on the plan, once Interior finalizes a draft. The department has not yet posted it at regulations.gov, the federal government’s online portal for that purpose.

As U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement (ICE) conducts raids on farms at the direction of the Trump administration, some lawmakers and agricultural organizations in Pennsylvania are criticizing the effort.
“This move could have devastating consequences for our nation’s food security,” Pennsylvania Farm Bureau President Chris Hoffman said in a statement. “Without a stable, dependable workforce, our fields will go unplanted, our crops unharvested, and our livestock uncared for. The dedicated men and women who work on our farms alongside our farmers are not just employees; they are the bedrock of our food supply chain. 
“Any disruption to their ability to work threatens the availability and affordability of food for every American family,” he added. 
The organization has more than 25,000 members and is the largest agriculture organization in the state. Hoffman said he and his fellow farmers are “deeply concerned” about the reports that Trump’s administration, after a brief pause, would resume and continue ICE raids on farms, ranches and packing plants.
Bailey Fisher, the group’s federal affairs specialist, told the Capital-Star the organization is worried that the raids can impact agriculture when they are already facing a workforce shortage.
“Agriculture and the workforce is not something where you can just hire a new person every week. It takes a while to train that person, especially if they’re working with livestock,” Fisher said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One example she noted was how some may not feel comfortable working with a dairy cow or may not have the background with large animals.
“So, it’s not just a matter of finding just somebody to milk your cow,” Fisher said. “It takes experience. It takes somebody who’s comfortable doing it, knowing the animal, knowing what the animal needs.”
“It’s not just something that anybody can do and that anybody wants to do,” she added.
Pennsylvania’s dairy industry is the number one segment of its agriculture economy, according to Pennsylvania’s Department of Agriculture.
Fisher said she has heard the calls for the industry to just “hire domestic” workers.
“We have tried that. Trust me, we have tried every possible solution you could think of, and the domestic workforce is just not there in the Ag industry,” Fisher said. “A lot of Americans, they prefer the office job over getting up at 4 a.m. to go milk a dairy cow or being out in the hot summer heat, picking lettuce, harvesting lettuce, or fruit, etc.”
Fisher said she’s seen reports about ICE raids on farms in other states, but as of Tuesday afternoon, has not received any calls about any recently taking place in Pennsylvania.
She said while the group’s members respect federal agents and federal officials, they should know their rights and have the paperwork prepared.
“So we’re telling them, ‘Don’t be disorganized. Have your information ready to go, if need be,’” Fisher said.
She said the Farm Bureau hasn’t sent out any guidance for supervisors and workers on how to handle a visit from ICE, but instead is leaving that up to the employers to seek their own legal guidance.
“We don’t really try to get involved in guiding them on legal issues like that,” she said.
The administration’s change of heart has rankled some members of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation.
U.S. Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson (R-Centre) represents the commonwealth’s rural 15th Congressional District. He called the raids earlier this month in some states “just wrong.”

Thompson, the first Pennsylvanian to chair the House Committee on Agriculture in nearly 170 years, is a Trump ally. But, he also realizes the potential impact on the country.
“They need to knock it off,” Thompson told reporters on June 12, according to POLITICO. “Let’s go after the criminals and give us time to put processes in place, so we don’t disrupt the food supply chain.”
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, has also been critical of the approach.
“I’ve been clear that we need to address the immigration crisis in our nation and keep violent criminals off our streets – but deporting the hardworking people who keep farms across our country afloat is not the solution,” Fetterman told the Capital-Star. “If we just round up the 40 percent of farmworkers who don’t have papers without a real plan, the only thing we’ll do is increase costs for families.”
“I’ve shared my concerns with Secretary (Brooke) Rollins and am grateful for her partnership as we continue protecting Pennsylvania farmers and farmworkers,” he added. “Instead of treating migrant labor as a political football, we need legislative reform to address this issue head on.”
One potential solution to Fetterman is the Affordable and Secure Food Act, sponsored by U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO). The proposal would provide a number of reforms, including extending the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program. The United States Department of Agriculture describes the program as one that “helps American farmers fill employment gaps by hiring workers from other countries.”
During a Q&A with the Capital-Star this past March, Thompson discussed the need to reform the H2-A program, saying it “does not help our year-round agriculture needs.”










A lot of Americans, they prefer the office job over getting up at 4 a.m. to go milk a dairy cow or being out in the hot summer heat, picking lettuce, harvesting lettuce, or fruit.


– Bailey Fisher, the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau's federal affairs specialist.


Hoffman, the state Farm Bureau president, also called on Congress to prioritize H-2A visa reform and described the current system as “cumbersome, expensive, and fails to meet the year-round needs of modern agriculture.”
The American Immigration Council estimates that 196,100 undocumented migrants live in Pennsylvania, which is based on the most recently available census data from 2023. Just under 30,000 may work in the farming industry, according to estimates from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, which cites 2017 census data.
The Capital-Star reached out to Pennsylvania’s Department of Agriculture, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) and U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District), a member of the House Agriculture Committee, for comment, but did not receive any responses. Thompson also did not respond to an additional request for comment.

As a workaround to a labor shortage, North Carolina is relying on some of its incarcerated workforce to install air conditioning in prisons.

There are many things that have changed for the better in North Carolina prisons over the last century.
That said, it’s also true that North Carolina summers have always been miserably hot and that commercial air conditioning was first introduced nearly a century ago — facts that render the lack of air conditioning in many of our state’s prisons today an absolute scandal.
The Department of Correction has been pursuing an initiative to finally end this tortuous situation, but there remains a long way to go as many facilities remain unairconditioned.
And that harsh reality is a threat to everyone in the facility – guards and incarcerated people alike – especially men and women prisoners who are elderly and in bad health.
The bottom line: As with the lack of adequate staff and so many other inhumanities in our prison system, it’s our cheapskate legislature’s refusal to appropriate adequate funds that is ultimately to blame. One wishes each lawmaker would have to spend a summer night in one of these facilities to experience the cruel and unusual punishment their inaction is inflicting.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)More than 100 bills now have a chance to ultimately become law this year, though many with reduced price tags and scope.
Among those advanced were bills to approve exclusive rights to internet gaming for Wabanaki Nations, establish a property tax relief task force, add Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to Maine’s learning results, require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns, and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following a spill in Brunswick last summer. 
The Legislature will return on Wednesday to ultimately decide which to send to Gov. Janet Mills, as well as to potentially consider other bills still in limbo in the chambers. 
The 116 proposals advanced on Tuesday were selected out of nearly 300 bills that had been placed on what’s known as the appropriations table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee that sets the budget. Most bills placed on the table already passed both chambers but still need to be funded. 
In total, the bills on the table would have cost about $2.5 billion over the next two years, but there is about $7 million left to be allocated after Mills signed the budget addition into law on Monday. 
Some of the bills the appropriations committee voted “off the table,” to send back to the full Legislature for consideration, were advanced without changes. 
That was the case for the bills related to igaming for the Tribes, the property tax task force and Asian American history requirements. It was also the vase for a bill to make the governor’s energy office a cabinet level department and another to alter the real estate transfer tax in an effort to protect mobile home parks.
However, the committee amended a number of bills to reduce their cost or strike it altogether.
For example, the committee voted LD 1126 — the bill to require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns — off the table after removing its appropriations, noting that the Department of Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck said the positions those funds would have supported were not necessary to fulfill the goal of the bill. 
Meanwhile, another bill related to firearm regulation — LD 1867, to prohibit financial institutions and merchants from using firearm codes to track purchases  — remains on the table, though Republicans on the committee attempted to move it off.
One of the most common ways the committee amended bills was by striking their fiscal notes but then allocating just $500 to set up a fund that keeps a path open for future funding, by the state or other revenue. 
This was the case for LD 1738, which aims to fund proper disposal of syringe litter, LD 1529, which seeks to enhance the protection of high-value natural resources statewide, and LD 1643, which would establish the Maine Life Science Innovation Center, among others. 
After the committee included a $3 million appropriation for family planning services in the budget, it opted to also vote an amended version of a bill, LD 143, off the table to provide up to another $3 million by making such a transfer a priority for any unappropriated surplus of the general fund.
This move received sharp rebukes from Republicans on the committee, including Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) who said she was “thoroughly disgusted.”
But Republicans on the committee successfully moved a few items off the table. One was a bill to create the Net Energy Billing Cost Stabilization Fund. Another was a bill to provide that accrued and unused hours of earned paid leave from the previous year of employment must be available in the year of employment. And another was a bill to extend the statute of limitations on criminal actions involving aggravated sex trafficking.
In other cases, the committee funded proposals but at reduced amounts.
This occurred with bills to fund free health clinics and the Maine Emergency Medical Services Community Grant Program, as well as two proposals to reduce student homelessness, one aimed at helping students at risk of homelessness and another aimed at students who are already unhoused. 
One bill ended up requiring no committee action — LD 1425, which aims to improve access to sustainable and low-barrier trauma recovery services — because it is being funded by settlement money provided by the Office of the Maine Attorney General. 
This bill as well as a handful that were incorporated into the budget will still remain “on the table” upon adjournment because they’ve been funded an alternative way. 
Some of the bills on the table that were funded through the budget include an expansion of Maine’s version of a child tax credit for children under six and an initiative to help mitigate the fact that the Older Americans Act is no longer funded by the federal government.
Further, committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said before concluding work Tuesday night that the committee intends to carry over the bills still on the table into next year. 
“There’s another chance for all of them,” Rotundo said.

The changes expand GOP control of elections to the local level. 
Last month, Boliek appointed a Republican majority state elections board under a new law that took appointment power away from Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. 
Stein has sued over the law, but state appellate courts have allowed it to go into effect. Historically, the governor’s party has held majorities on the state and county boards. 
Reporter Bryan Anderson was first to identify the partisan switch. 
Local boards of election are the on-the-ground decision makers that pick polling locations, set early voting schedules and hours, and decide whether provisional ballots should be accepted. 
Local board majorities appoint county elections directors with approval from the state Board of Elections executive director. 
The new Republican state Board of Elections made quick use of its power to replace the state elections director with Republican Sam Hayes last month at its first meeting. 
“I hope we’ll continue to have an election board that is focused on upholding the laws of the state of North Carolina and not involved in the partisan politics,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), one of the Senate Elections Committee chairmen, said Tuesday afternoon. 
Greg Flynn was a Democratic member of the Wake County board who was not reappointed Tuesday. 
Flynn said in his years on the Wake board, most of its votes were unanimous and members “worked together pretty well.”
The change “I think will have a big effect on early voting site decisions,” he said. 
In 2018, when local boards were split 2-2, Wake Republicans voted against opening an early voting site at NC State University, Raleigh’s News & Observer reported. In 2014, a dispute over a proposed early voting site at Appalachian State University in Boone reached the state Supreme Court, WRAL reported. 
The state Board of Elections met Tuesday to approve a plan to collect missing identification numbers from voters who don’t have them attached to their names in the state’s electronic voter database. 
About 98,000 of these voters, those who registered after 2004, won’t be able to have their ballots automatically count until they provide a partial Social Security number or driver’s license number. The Board is going to send information to these voters asking for the information next month. 
Mail will go out later this summer to about 96,000 voters who don’t have that information attached to their files, but who showed ID when voting. They will vote regular ballots. 
A third mailing will go out to voters who haven’t responded to previous notices. 
The mailings will include pre-addressed, postage-paid envelopes.
Additionally, county elections officials will review the electronic files for data that is missing even though the voters supplied it. 
The Trump Justice Department sued the Board of Elections last month claiming that the missing government numbers violate federal law. 
Hayes told the Board the Justice Department has tentatively signed off on the plan and it could result in an agreement to resolve the lawsuit. 
The DOJ lawsuit echoed claims that GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin, the failed candidate for a state Supreme Court seat, made as he tried to overturn his Democratic opponent’s November victory. 
The Republican National Committee and the state Republican party made the same claim when it sought to purge 225,000 voters from the rolls. 
As part of Griffin’s suit, the state Court of Appeals ordered the Board to gather the missing voter information.
The goal of the data collection is to comply with the Court of Appeals order and resolve the lawsuits, Hayes said. 
“I intend to follow the law, both the letter and spirit,” Hayes said.  “I believe that this will instill confidence in our elections, and I have said election security and voter access are just two sides of the same coin.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5071578-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 06:00:36.370628

(Photo courtesy of Wyatt Young)As Virginia’s various government agencies wait to hear how the federal budget will affect their funding, some departments have already seen significant cuts that are putting a hold on important hazard mitigation projects and emergency management support.
In an effort to understand the full scope of federal cuts on the commonwealth, state House members have been hosting committee meetings in communities across Virginia. In a Friday meeting in Norfolk, which increasingly faces rising sea levels and coastal land loss, officials shared projects and goals that will not move forward.
“This is fiduciary responsibility in making sure that we’re preparing our communities for what is 100% coming,” said Jay Ford, the Virginia Policy Manager for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. “And if we don’t, we’re going to be holding the bill at a multiplier many times higher on the backside. It’s about making limited tax dollars go further, and the right move there is to invest in climate resilience on the front end.”
According to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, projects in the region that have already had their federal funding cut include:

Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation – $300,000 for flood mitigation from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
City of Hampton and nonprofit Wetlands Watch – $20 million for flood mitigation at Aberdeen Gardens from the Environmental Protection Agency
Newport News – $517,000 for Stoney Run Flood reduction improvements
City of Portsmouth – $24 million for improvements to the Lake Meade Dam
Hampton Roads Planning District Commission – $200,000 for updates to Hazard Mitigation Plan

“People got caught up on buzzwords and that’s super unfortunate. But each administration will have different priorities,” Ford said. “But at the end of the day, if someone actually looked at these projects, these are infrastructure, plain and simple.”
The Lake Meade Dam funding was part of the cancelled Building Resilient Infrastructure Communities program that was discontinued by FEMA earlier this year. It also had allocated $12 million to improve Richmond’s water treatment facility that has been plagued with issues leading to multiple boil water advisories this year.
“When we’re looking at dam safety or we’re looking at a neighborhood where more than a quarter of the citizens live in the flood zone, it has nothing to do with this bigger picture of climate change. I mean, that is exacerbating the issue, but this is just about people and water quantity and health and human safety,” Ford said. “…the end result is, we have neighborhoods that are less safe as a result of that, and we have a high risk situation with flood damage to personal property and risk to human safety.”
Ford said the loss of research and data from the U.S. Geological Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration due to funding cuts harms local municipalities that rely on that information to form their resiliency and infrastructure plans. He highlighted the work being done at universities across the commonwealth that can help fill some of those gaps.
“We have tremendous capacity, but we’re not really centralizing it in any way to make sure everyone’s working together to help protect Virginia communities. And we’re really under investing in them,” Ford said.
Local governments are now looking for alternative funding streams for projects that have been cut. While it is unclear the scope of what the federal government will be willing to pay for as larger budget debates are carried out, some of the projects are being retooled in the application process to submit to other agencies as infrastructure projects rather than solely resilience projects.
In terms of state funding for resiliency projects, Virginia is still missing out on millions of dollars for flood mitigation because Gov. Glenn Youngkin removed the state from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI. While the Floyd County Circuit Court ruled his removal of the state from the program unlawful, the state has not been placed back into the program while appeals play out, Inside Climate News reports.
“We’ve had the situation now where scores of localities have finished a resilience plan. They’ve sent it to the state hoping that was going to unlock these community flooded preparedness dollars, and the pool has just shrunk significantly because we’ve gotten out of RGGI,” Ford said.
With flood mitigation projects taking a backseat, the Virginia Emergency Management Association (VEMA) is urging legislators to find a way to fund their work without federal help, or at least less of it. VEMA supports state agencies, schools, higher education institutions, businesses, faith-based organizations, and others in emergency situations.
Unlike The Virginia Department of Emergency Management, VEMA is more focused on advocacy and expanding emergency management to corners of the state that may not have a full time emergency manager in place. 
“One dollar spent in mitigation renders six dollars worth of cost savings in a future disaster,” said Jared Hoernig, co-chair of VEMA’s legislative committee. “You know that is significant if we can relate to the studies like for the Hampton road area where there was a $15.6 billion potential loss if we had a category three hurricane that hit Hampton Roads”

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-06-25 09:02:03+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,SNAP doesn’t just feed families — it sustains Pennsylvania’s farms and food economy,Capital-Star Guest Contributor,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/food-insecurity/snap-doesnt-just-feed-families-it-sustains-pennsylvanias-farms-and-food-economy/,"Agriculture is Pennsylvania’s leading industry. Roughly 25 cents from every grocery dollar spent goes back to the farm. That means when SNAP dollars are slashed, it’s not just low-income households that suffer, it’s also the 48,800 family-run farms across the state that feel the blow.","A “SNAP welcomed here” sign is seen at the entrance to a Big Lots store in Portland, Oregon. (Getty Images)A package of lean ground beef tastes the same whether you pay for it with cash, credit, or  EBT card. Food retailers should know. They are the ones putting it out for sale each day for  their customers.  
Out of the 40,000 different food items you might see in a larger supermarket, ground beef is  one of the most commonly purchased by both SNAP and non-SNAP households. It’s up  there with a gallon of milk, a loaf of bread, and poultry. 
The biggest difference between a SNAP household and a non-SNAP household? An EBT  card, and some tough times. Not what they buy. 
In fact, when it comes to food items purchased by SNAP households – an overwhelming  majority of which include at least one member who is a child, an elderly adult, or person  with a disability – the top ten categories and top seven specific commodities are the same,  though ordered differently. 
The reason is simple. 
SNAP families are regular families who happen to need some  temporary assistance putting food on the table. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When the USDA studied this issue, they found that about 40 cents of every dollar of food  expenditures by SNAP households is spent on basic items such as meat, fruits, vegetables,  milk, eggs, and bread. Another 40 cents are spent on a variety of items such as cereal,  prepared foods, dairy products, rice, and beans. The last 20 cents out of every dollar  typically goes on sweetened beverages, desserts, salty snacks, candy and sugar.  
For non-SNAP households? Pretty much the same.  
And just as important, the economic activity that SNAP purchases support is exactly the  same as from a non-SNAP household. Grocers don’t order SNAP ground beef and non SNAP ground beef. Beef is beef. Milk is milk. Bananas are bananas.  
Businesses along Pennsylvania’s food supply chain – from your local grocery and  convenience store, to wholesale and distribution companies, food producers, and farmers  – all benefit greatly from SNAP. It’s arguably the most successful public-private partnership in  American history. 
Recent events and some back-of-the-napkin math bear it out. During the COVID-19  pandemic, the federal government introduced SNAP Emergency Allotments (EAs) to help  address rising food insecurity. These were temporary, additional payments to households  receiving SNAP benefits. EAs provided SNAP households an additional $95 in benefits per  month, at minimum. When EAs ended in March 2023, the Department of Human Services  reported an average loss of $181 per SNAP household across Pennsylvania.
Beyond what that loss meant for families themselves – and we know it meant increased  food insecurity, greater reliance on food pantries, and heightened financial stress – for  businesses in the food sector it meant, quite literally, less food being purchased, and  therefore ordered, and therefore produced. 
With more than one million SNAP households in  Pennsylvania each losing an average of $181, we can estimate a direct contraction of  almost $189 million per month in the state’s food economy when Emergency Allotments  ended. And of course the true economic impact was larger than that because we know that  for every dollar invested in SNAP, there is an impact worth more than $1.50 that goes into  local economies supporting those businesses getting food to store shelves, and the people  they employ.

As you read this, Congress is contemplating massive changes to how SNAP is funded.  While exact figures remain the subject of negotiation, the upshot is that a sea change could  be on the way that would fundamentally alter how food assistance works in the United  States, with potentially catastrophic impacts not just to SNAP recipients but your local  supermarket, food producers, and farmers across Pennsylvania. 
Of course there are always opportunities and ways to improve the way government  programs work, and we should be clear-eyed about taking on that challenge when it comes  to SNAP. 
But the fact is it remains a highly popular, and massively successful program that  fundamentally achieves what it sets out to do: Provide temporary assistance to families  who need help putting food on the table.  
SNAP also means a great deal to the farmers, truck drivers, warehouse workers, and food  sellers in our communities, who all benefit from the added demand the program helps  support. Pennsylvanians, and in particular our congressional delegation, should not lose  sight of that as work on a federal budget reaches a climax in Washington.

For the second week in a row, Ohio Senate Bill 56 was up for a possible vote out of the Ohio House Judiciary Committee, but both times the vote did not take place. 
Once the bill is voted out of committee, it can be brought to the House floor for a vote. The Senate passed the bill in February.  
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Last week, the bill was removed from the committee agenda and this week the committee meeting — which only had S.B. 56 on the agenda — was canceled. 
“We are going to push pause,” state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said when asked about the marijuana bill. “We’re going to take the summer and come back and potentially take another crack at it.”
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said the Senate raised more than a dozen issues related to S.B. 56 last week. 
“I just told my caucus, ‘We’re not going to just say, OK, because we’re so anxious to pass the marijuana bill, which I’d like to get it done, but we’re not going to give up House priorities to do that,’” he said last week. 
The lawmakers are currently working on the state’s two-year operating budget, which Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine must sign before July 1. The lawmakers will go on summer break after the budget is finished.
S.B. 56 would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, limit the number of active dispensaries to 400 and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
It would keep Ohio’s home grow the same at a limit of six plants per person and 12 plants per residence. State Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, introduced the bill in January and the bill originally would have limited Ohio’s home grow from 12 plants down to six. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment.
“The people of Ohio spoke very clearly on this issue,” said Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati. “They knew what they were voting on, and they voted to pass adult-use cannabis recreationally here in the state of Ohio.”
Intoxicating hemp products 
The House has made significant changes to S.B. 56, most notably adding regulations to intoxicating hemp products.
As the bill currently stands, only a licensed marijuana dispensary would be able to sell intoxicating hemp products that have been tested and complied with packaging, labeling and advertising requirements.
The Ohio Department of Commerce would regulate intoxicating hemp products and drinkable cannabinoid products. Grocery stores, carryout stores, bars, and restaurants would continue to be able to sell drinkable cannabinoid products.
Isaacsohn agrees there should be regulations around intoxicating hemp products, but wants it to happen through a “clean bill.”
“It is so tied up in trying to overturn the will of the voters,” he said. “If we had a clean bill to fairly regulate intoxicating hemp, we could have voted on it months ago, years ago. … There are so many common sense things that we agree on, and when the majority brings forward a clean bill, we would be happy to vote for it.”

The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC. 
State Rep. D.J. Swearingen, R-Huron, was planning on introducing amendments to the bill’s hemp provisions during Tuesday’s committee meeting, but that didn’t happen since the meeting was canceled. 
The American Republic Policy worked with Swearingen on the amendments which would have allowed licensed hemp companies in Ohio to continue to operate their retail stores and create a unified regulatory framework for hemp and marijuana products, said Dakota Sawyer of American Republic Policy. 
“The same regulations that would apply to marijuana under the Ohio administration code would apply to hemp products as well,” he said. “We are ensuring that we do not have state-sanctioned monopolies in the state of Ohio, that federally legal hemp products can be accessed through independent businesses, and that they would not be forced to go into dispensaries.” 
Sawyer said forcing hemp products into only dispensaries would eliminate market competition. 
“We want to ensure that there are options out for people, to ensure that they are able to purchase what they love, what they would want … and to ensure that we do not have state-sanctioned monopolies,” he said. 
State Rep. Jennifer Gross, R-West Chester, said 3,000 hemp businesses would close if S.B. 56 passes as it currently stands — with hemp products only being sold in dispensaries. 
“We need to reward the good actors,”  she said. “We need to ID check our hemp products when it is consumable. We also need to allow these businesses to stay open.”
Wesley Bryant, company owner of 420 Craft Beverages in Cleveland, said he already does many of the things that are outlined in the proposed amendment. 
“Every square inch of my facility is fully covered by cameras,” he said. “We have a full track and traceability of everything that comes into my facility. We even go so far as to double check IDs. And my doors stay locked throughout the day. You have to be buzzed in order to enter the facility.”
DeWine and various lawmakers have expressed safety concerns for children when it comes to hemp products, but Sawyer said the average age of an Ohio hemp customer is 40 years old. 
“It’s not geared towards children,” Sawyer said. “What some legislators have done is created this mystical boogeyman that says that all these hemp people are doing all these crazy things that are attracting minors. And essentially we’re saying, let’s punish the bad actors that are doing that, but let’s not punish the good guys for that.” 
But Adrienne Robbin, deputy executive director of Ohio Cannabis Coalition (OHCANN), said Ohio children are being put at risk by intoxicating hemp products. 
“It’s a sad day for all Ohioans that we’re going to continue to see these illicit products be sold in our state over the summer,” she said. “These products are being marketed to (children) specifically,” she said. “I think the hemp industry is really good at pulling a few good actors out and highlighting them, but the reality is, the majority of these products are illicit.”
Sawyer said he would prefer to see the legislation as two separate bills — one with marijuana regulations and a separate one with hemp regulations. 
“Marijuana and hemp are totally separate in terms of the industry and products,” he said.

(Photo by Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)Rep. Juliet Harvey-Bolia said she filed House Bill 71 last year as “a contingency plan” in case Kamala Harris won the U.S. presidential election and “people were going to continue flowing through the border.” She said Donald Trump’s victory made the bill less important, but she decided not to withdraw it because “there’s no harm in putting the bill through anyway.”
If passed on Thursday and signed into law by Gov. Kelly Ayotte, HB 71 would ban New Hampshire public schools, colleges, and universities from housing immigrants. Any school in violation would lose state funding. The bill includes exceptions for short-term shelter during natural disasters, such as a hurricane or snowstorm. It would include both migrants being housed while the government tries to resettle them and while they’re en route to deportation.
Harvey-Bolia said this is about ensuring schools aren’t shut down to make space for migrants.
“This is about students,” she said. “After we went through COVID and all that, I think us parents were frustrated with shutdowns.”
Harvey-Bolia, a Tilton Republican, said the inspiration for the bill was a school closing in New York City to shelter migrants. In January 2024, during a severe storm, migrants were moved from a tent shelter to a Brooklyn high school during a severe storm, a move that caused intense backlash from the community, according to news reports from the city. Students attended classes online for one day while migrants waited out the storm.
She and other lawmakers also pointed to the issues at migrant shelters in Massachusetts, arguing they’re inappropriate for school buildings. Last Monday, during a committee meeting to discuss the bill, Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican, said he did a public records request for incident reports at facilities in Massachusetts that were used to house migrants.
“Looking through them, there were incidents like fights, assaults, overdoses, rapes, and attempted suicides in those reports,” Cordelli said. “A lot of the reports were redacted, a lot of information, but that’s what I found going through them.”
Sen. Tim Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, said that for these provisions, the “base policy” of the bill, “we all agree with it.” However, there were differences between the House and Senate’s positions on other aspects of the bill.
Non-germane amendments
In addition to the sections regarding use of school and college buildings to house migrants, the Senate added new unrelated provisions to the bill that were not present in the House’s version. One of those provisions would require towns and cities with 10,000 or more people to personally notify homeowners of any changes to their property’s valuation and to post the change publicly in a newspaper, online, and on social media. 
When negotiators from the House and Senate met to hash out these differences last week, House representatives accepted the change but with one tweak. They removed the requirement that municipalities personally notify homeowners because they were afraid it would require them to purchase stamps, making it an unfunded mandate. The language was updated to just require they post the valuation changes publicly.
Senate negotiators also tried unsuccessfully to get their House counterparts to incorporate language from a different bill, Senate Bill 241, into HB 71. That language sets up a state fund to accept private donations to raise money for the state parks division to build a wheelchair accessible pier at Hampton Beach. Negotiators with the Senate argued it would create a tourist attraction, allow people with disabilities to enjoy the beach, and be done without state funding. House negotiators refused to accept the provision over concerns about maintenance and parking, and doubts that private donations would cover the project.
The negotiators will now take the newly amended bill, with the property valuation provision, to their respective chambers for a full floor vote on Thursday. If it passes both chambers, Ayotte will have the options of signing it into law, vetoing it, or allowing it to become law without her signature.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/migrantsschools-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 06:00:36.370628

(Photo by Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
Uber, Lyft oppose some bills that aim to prevent assaults during rides

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.










We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
Thousands are suing states over sexual abuse in juvenile detention facilities

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sexual assault survivors can now track their rape kits in most states

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

The decision marks a partial victory for Gov. Josh Stein, who sued over provisions of Senate Bill 382 — a measure approved by the GOP-dominated General Assembly shortly after last fall’s election that sough to limit gubernatorial powers. A panel of the Wake Superior Court ruled in his favor on judicial appointments, but against him on a provision removing his ability to appoint a member and the chair of the North Carolina Utilities Commission. The court also upheld a separate law reducing Stein’s power over the Building Code Council by requiring supermajority votes for any action.
The three-judge panel was made up of James Floyd Ammons, Jr., A. Graham Shirley, and Imelda J. Pate — an Independent, Republican, and Democrat, respectively. The law would have helped Republicans maintain dominant majorities on the state Court of Appeals and Supreme Court, where they control 12 of 15 seats and five of seven seats, respectively.
Stein lost two challenges to other provisions of SB 382 earlier this year, with a Wake Superior Court panel ruling against him on a section of the bill removing the State Highway Patrol from his authority and a Court of Appeals panel denying his effort to retain oversight of the State Board of Elections, despite a Superior Court ruling in his favor.
Stein posted a reaction to the ruling on his personal account on the social media platform X expressing a mixed reaction:

“The court’s decision supporting the Governor’s authority to make judicial vacancies maintains our state’s separation of powers. The court should have followed those same principles in its ruling on the Utilities Commission and Building Code Council, and I’m disappointed it did not.
Utility costs are rising, and heat waves like this week prove the importance of our state’s diverse energy mix and clean energy economy. As our state legislature and our federal government both seek to roll back our clean energy future, North Carolina families will be the ones who foot the bill.”    
State Treasurer Brad Briner, who received appointment power to the Utilities Commission in place of Stein, praised the Superior Court for upholding his new authority. In April, he named former environment secretary and climate change skeptic Donald van der Vaart to the board.
“This decision affirms that the governor does not have ultimate authority over other duly elected members of the Council of State to carry out their roles and responsibilities as members of the executive branch,” he said. “The judges, to their credit, carefully reviewed the matter, and properly found that the General Assembly is not prohibited from empowering the treasurer to appoint a member to the Utilities Commission.”
Tuesday’s decision is likely to be appealed to the state Court of Appeals, which has shown a greater willingness to support Republican efforts to tighten control of the judiciary, such as when it backed Judge Jefferson Griffin’s challenge to the state Supreme Court race.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Owners of small pharmacies — many themselves members of local chambers of commerce — are accusing the Ohio Chamber of Commerce of siding with huge corporate middlemen who are driving them out of business. 
That undermines Ohioans’ health and costs the state’s businesses and taxpayers far more in the long run, the pharmacists say.
Pharmacies of all sizes are battling with drug middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, over provisions in the state budget governing how prescription drugs are priced and how pharmacies are paid for dispensing them. 
Measures intended to help pharmacies were built into the Ohio House version of the state operating budget, stripped out by the Ohio Senate, and are now in the hands of a conference committee working against a June 30 deadline.
New data show Ohio pharmacy closures even worse than originally thought

Ohio and other states have been hemorrhaging pharmacies for years, and at an accelerating pace. Last year, Ohio lost 215 pharmacies and the total number dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory, according to an online tracker launched by the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. 
That creates serious health concerns, especially in underserved areas where many face health and transportation challenges. The loss of a community’s sole pharmacy can make it nearly impossible for some to get their medicine or professional advice about how to manage their diabetes or blood pressure.
Closures of isolated pharmacies creates deserts, and they’re growing. In Meigs County in Southeastern Ohio, for example, nearly 40% of the census tracts are part of what the pharmacy board calls pharmacy deserts. 
“As more pharmacies close in Ohio, we’re going to see poorer health — we’re not going to see positive outcomes,” said Denise Conway, owner of Conway’s Danville Pharmacy. “We’re going to see more ER visits. It’s just going to cost employers more.”
CVS in 2017 bought and closed the Lonsinger’s, the sole pharmacy in Danville, leaving the nearest one in Mount Vernon, 12 miles away.
“One man broke down crying,” librarian Betty Carpenter in 2019 told The Columbus Dispatch about an elderly resident. “He said, ‘I can’t walk to Mount Vernon.’ He could walk to Lonsinger’s.”
Also in 2019, Conway and her husband bought a Danville building and opened a pharmacy there while Knox County opened a health clinic on the premises. It was a rare example of a health care desert restored to life. Other Ohio communities aren’t likely to be so fortunate.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We’re down to about 300 independents,” said Dave Burke, a pharmacist, former state senator and executive director of the Ohio Pharmacists Association. “We’re really afraid as an organization that people are going to lose access to care. Care that keeps them out of the hospital. Care that shortens their stay in the hospital. And care that keeps them employed.”
Burke and many other pharmacists blame the rush of closures on the conduct of the big PBMs, the middlemen that are part of giant corporations. They decide on behalf of insurers what drugs are covered, and they decide how much to reimburse pharmacies for the drugs they dispense.
The three biggest PBMs — CVS Caremark, OptumRX and Express Scripts — control nearly 80% of the covered prescriptions in the United States. 
Critics say that enables them to extract huge, non-transparent discounts from drugmakers. They say it also enables them to force pharmacies into disadvantageous, take-it-or-leave-it contracts. Critics say that reimbursements under them are low and that they impose arbitrary rules and fees.
Each of the big-three PBMs is part of a vertically integrated, Fortune 15 health conglomerate. Each of those also owns a top-10 health insurer.
In addition, CVS owns the largest retail pharmacy chain and they all own mail-order pharmacies. So the big three get to decide how much to reimburse their own pharmacies as well as those of their competitors. 
Pharmacists and their advocates say the disputed language in the state budget would end those conflicts and rectify many problems. 
It would prohibit PBMs from imposing rules (and subsequently charging fees) that go beyond those of the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. It would end the murky system of reimbursements by requiring PBMs to pay pharmacies the prices listed in a public database — the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, survey. 
And it would require PBMs to pay pharmacies roughly $10 for each prescription they dispense. With the NADAC reimbursement meant to ensure pharmacies break even on the drugs, the dispensing fees are meant to cover overhead such as payroll, supplies, rent, and insurance.
“By definition the calculation is break-even,” Burke said. “You are paying (Medicaid’s) post-rebate cost of the drug. The only way to cover the bottle, the cost of the lid, the bag, the heat, the lights, the payroll is the dispensing fee.”
The provisions that the state Senate stripped out of its budget version mirror reforms the Ohio Department of Medicaid undertook in 2022. 
Following concerns among pharmacists and investigations by a newspaper and the state auditor, the department mounted its own probe of drug transactions. It learned that in 2017, two PBMs — CVS Caremark and OptumRx — billed the state $224 million more for drugs than they paid the pharmacies that had bought and dispensed them.
The Medicaid department fired the PBMs, created its own, single PBM, based reimbursements on the NADAC survey and started paying pharmacists a $10 per-prescription dispensing fee. 
Despite the higher reimbursements and dispensing fees, an analysis released earlier this year found that the new arrangement saved the state $140 million. That led many to conclude that the middlemen were skimming a hefty portion of the money flowing through the system.
Ohio Medicaid got rid of big middlemen, paid pharmacies more and saved $140 million, report says

Even so, applying the same rules to non-Medicaid transactions would “harm small businesses and their employees,” said Rick Carfagna, a former state representative who is now the senior vice president of government affairs at the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.
“PBMs are business-to-business entities, and they exist only because a company or health plan hires them,” Carfagna said in an email. “When you increase dispensing fees on a per-prescription basis, you’re impacting the ability of employers, including small businesses, local governments and labor organizations, to balance their budgets by controlling their health care costs. These increased fees eventually find their way downstream, in whole or in part, to all of those employers utilizing PBMs.”
Carfagna didn’t respond directly when asked whether Ohio’s independent and small-chain pharmacies are themselves small businesses that have been rapidly disappearing. 
Conway, who is herself chair-elect of the Knox County Chamber of Commerce, said Carfagna and the Ohio Chamber used deceptive language in fighting for the PBMs.
“The Ohio Chamber in their testimony called the dispense fee a tax,” she said. “It’s by no means a tax. It’s the cost of running a business. A dispense fee has always been built into the model of reimbursing a pharmacy. You can’t put a zero there. It’s the cost of running a business.”
Burke, executive director of the Ohio Pharmacists Association, said the Ohio Chamber’s position also ignores that Ohio Medicaid saved money when it increased dispensing fees and switched to a transparent system of reimbursements. Several other states, most recently Minnesota, have adopted similar arrangements.
“Every state that has gone to a transparent model hasn’t gone back to the traditional one,” Burke said. “They’re saving money and they’re not going back.”

Republish photo only with original article.)With the three-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion rights advocates are looking at a time when funding cuts could spell the closure of clinics and the limiting of reproductive access in Ohio and nationwide.
But local advocates are also resolute in saying health clinics will continue to serve Ohioans, and fight to maintain the rights in the state.
The federal budget reconciliation bill is still being debated, but one provision that has been included would “defund” Planned Parenthood, which the organization says could mean the closure of 200 clinics across the country.
Funding under Title X “family planning” grants could be slashed as well, which would also impact reproductive health clinics.
Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the measure a “big bad betrayal of a bill” in a Tuesday news call, and said the funding cuts in the bill “would make it harder, if not impossible, for everyone, everywhere to get an abortion.”
Since the 2022 Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization moved the issue of abortion legality to the states, Ohio has passed a constitutional amendment that in 2023 placed the right to abortion into the state’s founding document, making abortion legal up to viability, as determined by a physician. The measure passed with 57% of voters that November.
But the newest state operating budget, which could be approved by the General Assembly this week, could cause more limits to abortion services via a provision related to Medicaid.
The House and Senate both brought along a measure from Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive budget that would eliminate the Medicaid expansion group from the state’s program if the federal budget contributes less than the 90% it’s paying currently.
Should that contribution drop even 1%, the state budget states the expansion group, which policy experts say accounts for about 770,000 Ohioans, would be dropped from their health insurance.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That would represent 30% to 50% of patients who go to Cincinnati-area Planned Parenthood clinics just to obtain birth control, according to Nan Whaley, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region.
For other services, like health screenings, primary care services, specialist referrals, and abortion services, Whaley said patients who lose their Medicaid coverage likely “will go nowhere.”
“It’ll make Ohio less healthy, it’ll make abortions go up in Ohio,” Whaley said. “What’ll happen is the opposite of what (legislative and congressional Republicans) claim to want.”
While clinics will still be able to provide services to those with commercial insurance, the idea that the most vulnerable Ohioans will be without health care strikes advocates even more than threats to their existence that they’ve experienced many times before.
“There aren’t enough words for ‘unacceptable,’ and every Ohio congressperson should be voting ‘no’ and should be fighting for their constituents,” said Lauren Blauvelt, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio. “There’s no cost-savings in taking away people’s insurance.”
For Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health clinics, being the target of potential funding cuts and disapproval by elected officials who oppose abortion rights is nothing new.
“All providers and most non-profits are under attack in a way that they’re not use to in this environment, but we’re used to this,” Blauvelt said.
Clinics are working to continue providing as much care as they can, including providing and hoping to expand virtual health care.
Lexi Dotson-Dufault, executive director of the referral and resource service Abortion Fund Ohio, said her team is beginning to work with telehealth providers, in an effort to expand services and in anticipation of clinic closures, but more importantly so pregnant individuals can get questions answered.
“People are still confused about what care they can access in Ohio, where they can get that care, who’s there to help them access that care,” Dotson-Dufault said.
Once the budgetary decisions have been made, abortion rights advocates are also preparing for another fight: the total abortion ban bill that was recently introduced in the Ohio House.
While Dotson-Dufault, Whaley, and Blauvelt emphasized the unconstitutionality of the bill, which would seek to undermine the reproductive rights amendment, they aren’t taking it lightly.
Blauvelt said she remembers when the six-week abortion ban didn’t have the full support of the legislature or pro-life advocates, but then ended up being signed into law before it was struck down in court.
“Our supporters are not backing down, we are focused and we take this threat seriously,” Blauvelt said. “We expect our lawmakers to do better.”

Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, has a major part to play in supporting Medicaid recipients and rural hospitals in his home state, writes Clay Wirestone. He just has to raise his voice. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)It’s all come down to this.
The U.S. Senate will vote soon on a gargantuan tax and spending package that will rip health care coverage from thousands of Kansans and put our rural hospitals at grave risk of closure.
The numbers boggle the mind. Kansas will lose $4 billion in Medicaid funding, money that goes to cover low-income families. Some 13,000 residents will lose their coverage under the program as lawmakers try to secure massive tax cuts for the wealthiest among us.
So now’s the time for U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, that Kansas Republican stalwart, to step up and say publicly what he’s apparently been saying privately. Moran needs to come to Kansas now — today, if he can manage it — and hold a town hall meeting. Anywhere will do, although a centrally located city such as Topeka would allow more people to attend. He needs to invite every reporter from the Midwest. And he needs to make clear, for all to hear, that he supports poor Kansans and vital health care services.
Don’t do it someday, senator. Don’t assume your behind-the-scenes murmurs will make a difference.
Stand up and make some noise. Now.
I wouldn’t be asking Moran to do this if it didn’t seem like, at some level, he wanted to. I wrote on Monday about reports from Politico and The Hill that he had “raised concerns” and “drawn public red lines” with other senators concerned about cuts. I’m counting out U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, our other Republican in D.C. He’s been telling would-be doctors that they should toughen up and work their way through medical school without loans.

But there’s more. At a Senate gathering Monday, according to Punchbowl News, “Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who has stayed relatively quiet in public, also spoke up during the meeting, saying the provider tax language is bad for his state.”
He even gave a quote to the The Hill on Monday, saying, “I still have concerns about a few provisions in the bill. I’m not satisfied yet.”
Anyone with a modest sense of current-day politics understands why Moran has laid low. There’s little benefit these days to speaking out loudly when it comes to President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.” The administration prefers private, closed-door negotiations. Trump and his staff have made clear their disdain for outspoken voices such as Rep. Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican. Voting with the president most of the time doesn’t count. Public fealty counts more.
Nevertheless, Moran has earned political capital over his decade-plus as a senator, romping to a third term victory in 2022. He has refrained from social media fireworks and other grandstanding. He’s widely respected across Kansas and has made a point of charting a sensible course.
He has little to lose by speaking to Kansans. Sure, I understand why he may have avoided February’s virtual town hall, held during the height of Elon Musk’s reign of terror at the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk has vacated the premises, though, and I think that Kansans of every political stripe would welcome Moran’s voice.
Kansans depend on Medicaid. They depend on rural hospitals. Moran understands this and, from all appearances, has been fighting for both.
He should actually articulate those principles now, publicly and unashamedly.
He might be surprised by the support he gets.

When I held a knife for the first time, I squeezed the handle so hard that my knuckles turned white. I blinked an even number of times, and kept my fingers far away from where the sharp edge was, like it’d reach out and cut me. 
This feeling spread to other areas of my life. On tests, I had to bubble in answer sheets perfectly. When I rode the bus, I held onto the screws by the window because I believed that it would help if we ever crashed. 
During the COVID-19 lockdowns, I received a diagnosis for generalized anxiety disorder. I told a therapist about the discomfort that I felt doing everyday tasks, and they recommended weekly sessions until the feelings stopped.
However, they never did. The cost of these visits kept increasing, and eventually, my family and I realized that maybe therapy wasn’t the right choice.
But I kept obsessing over even numbers, erasing and re-filling answer sheets until they were just right, and fearing everything from knives to hospitals to driving. This was just how I lived my life, and I worried if nothing could ever change that.
Recently, I finished my first year at Ohio State University. I met incredible people, embraced new experiences, and broadened my knowledge of computer science.
Although, throughout this year of positive change, those same feelings continued to grow. I wasn’t sleeping well, and I was overwhelmed by the same bizarre, scary thoughts that had put my life on hold.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
So, like 35% of college students in the United States, I logged into my university’s counseling website and scheduled an appointment with a professional.
Soon, I was back on campus, and in my current therapist’s office. After a few sessions, she asked me if I knew what obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was. Then, she explained that this disorder accurately described the symptoms I’d been experiencing. She said that I wasn’t alone, that it was treatable, and that it no longer had to define who I was.
These counseling services are not burdens on our state’s $61 billion dollar operating budget. 
In fact, in a study published by the Healthy Minds Network, 77% of students surveyed reported that emotional and mental difficulties impaired their academic ability, yet only 45% of students sought counseling or therapy within the past 12 months. This is not without reason.
College students face significant barriers to receiving mental health care. In a report published by the Journal of College Student Mental Health, 89% of student participants noted that cost was the most significant barrier to receiving treatment.
To remedy these issues, Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed a $20 million dollar line item for college mental health services in Ohio’s state budget. For comparison, the current state budget allocates 600 million dollars for a new Cleveland Browns stadium.
Despite this line item being presented by a Republican governor, regarding an issue which has large bipartisan support, Republican members of the Ohio House decided to strike it from the budget.
Currently, I receive treatment for my OCD from Ohio State’s Counseling and Consultation Services, working towards a state of normalcy that I likely never would have achieved otherwise. However, my story is certainly not unique. If these cuts to college mental health care continue, many more students may not be able to say the same.
So, to Ohio Republicans: when will you decide to care?

As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

Hogan, the former Republican governor in a blue state, and Bullock, a former Democratic governor in a red state, were the featured speakers at a session on “How States Are Navigating an Era of Uncertainty,” hosted by The Pew Charitable Trusts and States Newsroom. (Maryland Matters is part of the States Newsroom network.)
Both said that during their time as governor, they learned the importance of elected officials from differing parties working together to find common ground on policy solutions, even though it was rarely easy.

“It wasn’t all ‘Kumbaya,’” Hogan said of his time working with the Democratic legislature. “We didn’t always agree. But we disagreed without demonizing the other side, and we tried to find common sense, bipartisan solutions to every problem.”
That formula didn’t always work out for them. Hogan flirted with a presidential bid in 202o, but decided against it after polls showed overwhelming GOP support for President Donald Trump in Maryland; Bullock got in the race that year, but was never able to make a dent in a crowded Democratic field and dropped out early.
Both ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate seats after their terms as governor ended. Bullock won about 45% of the vote in a 2020 challenge to Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who took 55%. And just last year, Hogan lost his bid for an open Senate to Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md), earning 43% of the vote to her 53%.
Despite their mixed success rate, both men said Tuesday they firmly believe that bipartisan efforts are best for the United States. Bullock said he hopes that it’s “not a bygone era” of politics.
“I’d say the best advice is to not pay too much attention to all the noise and to try to actually sit down and focus,” Bullock said. “If it’s just both sides yelling at each other, we’re never going to get anything done on every single issue. And that tends to happen. The more heated the rhetoric is, the less productive it is.”
Virginia Mercury Editor-in-Chief Samantha Willis moderated the discussion between the two former governors. (The Virginia Mercury is also a part of States Newsroom.) While the two former governors generally agreed and backed each other up, their ability to politely disagree was on display when Willis asked about the recent American bombing strikes in Iran.
Over the weekend, Trump ordered bombing raids on three nuclear facilities in Iran in an attempt, after almost two weeks of raids by Israel, to destroy the Iranians ability to develop nuclear weapons. Trump ordered the raids without seeking permission from Congress, which has to approve any act of war, leading to criticism over the propriety of the attack.

Hogan, for years a vocal critic of Trump, said he hopes the attack is a step toward peace in the Middle East and said he agreed with Trump’s decision to try to kneecap Iran’s nuclear efforts.
“The law says you have to notify Congress, which they did,” Hogan said. “You can’t have a debate with 535 people on when you’re stopping the biggest exporter of terrorism from getting a nuclear weapon … the commander in chief is empowered to make decisions like that.”
Bullock questioned how much notice Congress actually received before the attack, but agreed that Iran “getting nuclear capabilities would be very, very problematic.” He said the greater concern is the “erosion” of norms at the federal level.
“Congress deserves a heads up,” Bullock said.
Willis also asked about the rise in political violence, referencing the assassination attempt on Trump during his 2024 campaign as well as the recent killing of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and attack on Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman in politically motivated attacks. She asked how the two would respond to the situation if they were governor.
Hogan said that it’s up to state leaders and the federal government to “tone down the rhetoric.”
“America is deeply divided, and there’s angry, violent people on both sides … continuing to use inflammatory partisan rhetoric makes the problem much worse,” he said. “It’s really what I’ve been talking about for 10 years – nobody was listening, apparently.”
Bullock pushed back on Hogan, saying that there’s a difference between “political violence and reacting to political violence.”

“When you have an incident like what happened in Minnesota, every single statewide officeholder and governor and legislator — irrespective of the political party – ought to be standing up and saying, ‘That’s not right,’” Bullock said. “We may disagree, but we don’t countenance or accept political violence.”
They were more in tune when it came to the broad and “indiscriminate” cuts outlined in the Budget Reconciliation legislation currently in the hands of the U.S. Senate, often called the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by Trump.
Hogan said that while he agrees with efforts to cut down on what he called “inflated” federal spending, those sorts of cuts need careful and precise consideration, rather than taking a “meat ax” to the budget reconciliation bill.
They also agreed that the mass layoffs at federal agencies are costing thousands of Americans their jobs, including Marylanders and Montanans. Hogan urged governors to prepare for the needs of constituents as a result of those layoffs.
“Every time you lay somebody off, it’s not just the shrinking of the federal government, it’s real people,” he said. “We need to think about what kinds of benefits they’re going to see, how do we do workforce development and job retraining and reskilling?”
Hogan is often mentioned as a possible candidate for his old job when the governor’s seat comes up again in 2026, but when asked by reporters after the panel, he would only say he is “enjoying retirement” right now — and spending time promoting bipartisan politics.

Ford/Maryland Matters)The Maryland State Board of Education unanimously accepted final recommendations of a 58-member Blueprint special education work group Tuesday aimed at ensuring students with disabilities aren’t forgotten in the state’s multibillion-dollar education reform plan.
The group met for nearly two years to produce 27 recommendations in the report that are connected to the five pillars in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future: early childhood education, teacher diversity and retention, college and career readiness, more resources for student success, and governance and accountability.
When local school officials submitted their first Blueprint implementation plans in March 2023, every one said help was needed to recruit and retain teachers in all levels of special education. That need remains, the report said.
The board did not set a timeline for adopting the recommendations, but Liz Zogby said one that could be implemented in the coming school year is to provide special education training for general education teachers.
“It is really heartening that we have walked this dream for the last two years to get this done,” said Zogby, who co-chairs the work group with State Superintendent Carey Wright. “You can’t have change without getting leadership that truly believes in the vision and going to stand up for it.”
Zogby, who’s also co-chair of the Maryland Down Syndrome Advocacy Coalition, was praised by Wright, board President Joshua Michael and others as one of the main advocates for integrating special education in the 10-year Blueprint reform plan.
Board member Joan Mele-McCarthy, whose term expires after this week, suggested an analysis of the recommendations to see which could be implemented first and which would have the most impact.

“Because you have a lot of recommendations, I worry that in your effort to implement all of them, none get achieved or accomplished,” said Mele-McCarthy, executive director of The Summit School in Anne Arundel County.
“As I leave the board, I encourage my colleagues to keep talking about special education, the needs of children who have special needs and to really look at their achievement,” she said. “Unless we really pay attention to that and help children learn and achieve, we will not see the success that we would like.”
The recommendations include:

Strengthening partnerships between families, local school officials and state and community organizations;
Providing constant professional development for teachers and related service providers to teach students with disabilities; and
Proposing legislation for the 2026 General Assembly session to commission an “adequacy study” of Maryland’s special education funding.

Mele-Carthy, Zogby and Antoine Hickman, assistant state superintendent with the division of special education, noted that this year is the 50th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which was signed into law in November 1975 by then-President Gerald Ford.
Zogby said the state has about 106,000 students with disabilities, about 13% of the total student population.
“Dr. Michael talked about that inclusion isn’t a strategy. It’s a value. Completely agree,” Zogby said. “We can’t live that value without the presence of students in our classrooms.”
Library updates
The state board also approved amendments to bring state regulations library media services in line with the Freedom to Read Act approved by the legislature last year. The act, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) and Del. Dana Jones (D-Anne Arundel), reflected a national conversation about what books and materials should be publicly available in schools and libraries.
Maryland became one of the first states in the nation to enact strong protections for access to information in libraries, as well as penalties for those who attempt to thwart access.
Moms for Liberty, a conservative parental-rights group with about 300 chapters nationwide, has been one of the leaders pushing for stricter rules for school systems to select library books. Maryland has nearly a dozen local chapters including Carroll County, which successfully sought to remove dozens of books last year from school libraries.

The state law requires local school officials to manage library programs and not exclude or remove materials “because of partisan, ideological, or religious disapproval.” The law also says a local school board “may not dismiss, demote, suspend, discipline, reassign, transfer, or otherwise retaliate against a librarian, certified library media specialist, or school library media program support staff for performing their job duties.”
All local school systems must create a committee to review any books and other materials in school libraries that are challenged for removal. Beginning Oct. 1, local school systems will be required to have school library media program implementation documents that will berare reviewed and then approved by local school boards every two years.
The state Education  Department will implement a procedure to conduct periodic reviews of local school system library media programs to help identify any professional development needs for school staff.
Part of the updated regulations will require a certified school library media specialist in each school. Some schools do that now, but others may have one person who rotates between five and 10 schools, said Elise Brown, assistant state superintendent of instructional programs.
Michael asked how much flexibility local school systems — also called local education agencies, or LEAs — have when it comes to library personnel.
“The LEA has a lot of flexibility,” Brown said. “It really is determined by how they interpret [state regulations].”
Michael had a message for some local school officials and the public when it comes to “local control.”
“While we have a tradition of local control, what is on the books is a state public education, and so it is essential that our local schools maintain that trust and uphold the standards,” he said. “Should those standards not be upheld that we set, the tradition of local control will be challenged.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Antoine-Hickman-and-Liz-Zogby-6-24-2025-1024x806.jpg,,,2025-06-25 03:02:52.285947

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Maryland joined two more legal challenges to the Trump administration Tuesday, one to defend a specific minority business program and another to challenge a sweeping legal maneuver the White House has used to terminate billions in federal funding.
The legal actions, like many against the administration, were filed by Democratic attorneys general and governors from 20 or more states and the District of Columbia. They are the latest of about two dozen such suits that Maryland has joined since President Donald Trump took office.
The states filed a friend of the court brief in a federal case in Kentucky that Maryland Attorney General Brown called a “backdoor attempt to dismantle” the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program in federal contracting.
The lawsuit targets the Office of Management and Budget and a dozen other federal departments and agencies for what it calls their unlawful use of “a single subclause buried in federal regulations” to cut “billions of dollars of federal funding” to the states.
That subclause says a congressionally approved grant can be canceled for a handful of reasons, including if the grant “no longer effectuates … agency priorities.” OMB originally interpreted that to apply when new evidence showed that a grant was ineffective or not feasible. It was not to “terminate grants arbitrarily.”
But that’s what OMB has done since Trump took office, says the suit that was filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. OMB now claims that that five-word clause “permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind.”
Electric shock: Maryland has not joined suit against Trump over EV sales rules

Under that interpretation of the regulation, Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency directed federal agencies, including all of those listed in the lawsuit, to cut billions in grants that were already awarded in what the lawsuit described as a “slash-and-burn campaign.”
In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Brown’s office said that in Maryland these cuts have targeted funding for STEM research, food purchasing programs that support underserved communities and modernization of the state’s unemployment insurance systems.
The lawsuit is asking the court to rule that the OMB clause doesn’t “independently authorize the Trump administration to terminate funding based on agency priorities that were identified after the grant was awarded.”
Alternatively, the lawsuit seeks to overturn the Trump administration’s decision to terminate billions of dollars in federal funding “based on purported changes in agency priorities.”
“The Trump administration cannot unilaterally cut federal funding that Congress has already approved simply to serve its political agenda,” Brown said in a statement Tuesday. “We will not stand by while Maryland families lose access to healthy, affordable food or our universities are stripped of critical research funding.”
The challenge to the Department of Transportation’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program stems from a lawsuit filed by two highway contractors in 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. They argued that the program violates the Constitution’s equal protection clause by mandating a certain amount of funds be reserved for woman- or minority-owned businesses.
The program, founded in 1983, aims to ensure nondiscrimination in the awarding of contracts and has steered billions in federal transportation and infrastructure contracts to minority- and woman-owned businesses. Disadvantaged Business Enterprises include firms that are classified as a small business, majority owned by women, minorities or other socially and economically disadvantaged adults, and are run day-to-day by women or minorities.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The federal government, under former President Joe Biden, initially opposed the lawsuit. But after President Donald Trump was returned to office in January, the government switched its position and now sides with the highway contractors, according to the brief. The administration asked the court to issue a consent order which “could restrict or eliminate” the program across the country, according to a statement on Tuesday from Brown’s office.
The brief argues that if the court were to grant the order requested by the federal government and the two highway contractors, it would be exceeding “the proper role of the court in our adversarial system of government, because the parties requesting the order take the same position on the issues.”
“This so-called settlement is a backdoor attempt to dismantle a program that helps underrepresented businesses compete for federally funded transportation projects,” Brown said in a separate statement Tuesday. “We’re fighting to protect fair access, strengthen our infrastructure, and ensure these investments benefit all of our communities.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/russvought2025-scaled-1-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 03:02:52.285947

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Sign up for the 19th daily newsletter.
In an upset, Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani will be the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, defeating candidates including Andrew Cuomo, who was seeking a political comeback nearly four years after he resigned as governor of New York amid sexual misconduct allegations.
Cuomo conceded the race Tuesday night, before the final results of ranked-choice voting were clear.
“Tonight was not our night,” Cuomo told a crowd of supporters. “Tonight was Assemblyman Mamdani’s night. He put together a great campaign, and he touched young people and inspired them and got them to come out and vote. And he really ran a highly impactful campaign. I called him, I congratulated him, I applaud him sincerely for his effort.”
Mamdani, a 33-year-old self-described Democratic socialist, ran a campaign centered on making New York City more affordable. He proposed offering free universal child care, creating city-run grocery stores, rolling out free bus service and freezing rents on rent-stabilized units.
One year ago, Republican primary voters renominated President Donald Trump, who was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming the writer and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll between his first term and his return to office in January. Trump’s reelection was seen as marking a political and cultural backlash to the #MeToo movement.
But in New York, Democratic voters rejected a former governor who left office following a bombshell 165-page report overseen by the New York attorney general’s office that found he had sexually harassed 11 women, including some state employees.
Those findings were echoed by similar investigations conducted by the Department of Justice and the New York State Assembly. At the time, Cuomo apologized while denying the most serious allegations against him. In the years since, Cuomo and his allies have cast doubt on his accusers’ credibility and painted him as the victim of politically motivated investigations.
While New York City is overwhelmingly Democratic, Mamdani isn’t guaranteed a victory in the general election in November. Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled incumbent, is running as an independent. Cuomo also has indicated he could run as an independent on a “Fight and Deliver” ballot line. Unlike the primary, the general election won’t be held with ranked-choice voting, under which voters can rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If no candidates reach a majority on the first round of ranked-choice voting, votes are redistributed until a candidate gets to above 50 percent.
If elected, Mamdani would be the city’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor.
Cuomo came into the race leading with name recognition and with allies pouring millions of dollars into an allied super PAC. Mamdani, by contrast, built up an energized and passionate grassroots of volunteers. In a crowded field, ranked-choice voting also lent itself to coalition building — Mamdani cross-endorsed fellow progressives Michael Blake and Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller.
Issues like public safety and affordability, and not Cuomo’s scandals, took center stage in the mayoral campaign. But Mamdani still hammered Cuomo on his record in response to Cuomo criticizing him as inexperienced.
“Mr. Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace,” Mamdani said in a June 12 mayoral debate. “I have never cut Medicaid. I have never stolen millions of dollars from the MTA. I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. I have never sued for their gynecological records. And I have never done those things because I am not you, Mr. Cuomo.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2221884032.jpg,,,2025-06-25 01:00:00.017998

This One Big Beautiful Bill Act was introduced in Congress on May 20 and passed by the Republican controlled Congress on May 22 – two days later. All attempts to debate content within the bill by non-Republican members of Congress were ignored. If the U.S. Senate votes to pass this bill, it will become law. The Trump White House is urging the Senate to pass this bill ASAP.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a 1,037 page document, riddled with oblique references to established law that would be up-ended if the bill passes in the Senate. There are, as the New York Times writes, “Hidden Ways Trump’s Megabill Would Remake America” for everyone. 
Would there be winners and losers? Of course – there would be winners and losers. You have already heard about major changes to Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and the detrimental effect these changes would have on millions of people. But, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act changes everything – and I mean everything. Everything about American life would be affected: agriculture, the armed services, energy, commerce, financial services, homeland security, border security, customs – and the judiciary. 
The judiciary? Yes, the judiciary.
As the recent article points out, “An under the radar provision of the bill would brazenly undermine the power of federal courts.” Holding parties in contempt of court gives our federal court system remedy for blatantly ignored court rulings. What potential criminal would not want to eliminate that remedy? The new “system” would weaken the very justice system that has enabled the nation to survive.
Let’s be clear, the “power of U.S. Courts to hold parties in contempt of court has deep roots in English common law and has evolved significantly throughout U.S. history. The power to punish contempt was established by the late 18th century.” Then, “Following the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, Congress established the lower federal courts and explicitly granted them the power to punish contempt of their authority through the Judiciary Act of 1789.”
President Trump and Trump’s Congress are intending to up-end well over 200 centuries of English precedent and American civil law? Rather bold, I would say, not to mention unwise.
Perusing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, I came across Section 530A, regarding Trump Accounts. Trump Accounts? What are Trump Accounts and who would these benefit? The section reads, “A Trump account means a trust created or organized in the U.S. for exclusive benefit of an individual” and then goes on to state that Trump accounts “shall not be includable in the gross income of the distributor,” meaning the individual. What is that about? Would certain individuals be exempt from taxation, using a financial Trump Trust? I think people should understand a little more about this before the Senate passes this bill.
With such rapid passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by the 119th Congress, who, including congressional representatives, could evaluate this bill effectively? It is too much, too fast. It is everything all at once. And, it is not “beautiful.”
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If President Trump sees this bill as “beautiful,” I think there are a lot of other people who think is very ugly.

Lavine,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/25/as-hate-crimes-increase-this-ct-agency-steps-up/,It is an unfortunate reality that the number of hate crimes in the nation and in CT have been steadily rising in recent years.,"It is an unfortunate reality that the number of hate crimes in the nation and in our state have been steadily rising in recent years.
 Statistics gathered by the F.B.I indicate that there were 6,121 reported hate crimes in 2016; 8,263 in 2020, and 11,862 in 2023.  Some 5,900 of the incidents in the 2023 report were anti-Black, three times higher than the next highest racial or ethnic category. Religion-based incidents in the 2023 report totaled 2,699, more than half driven by anti-Jewish bias; incidents involving anti-Muslim bias also rose. 


The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reports that the number of hate incidents reported in Connecticut jumped from 91 in 2020 to 682 in 2024 —an increase of 650 percent.  Antisemitic incidents in Connecticut, according to the ADL, spiked from 24 in 2020 to 184, dropping slightly to 159 in 2024. Connecticut hate crime statistics compiled by the state police also show an upward trend. In 2021, there were 75 hate crime incidents; in 2024 there were 103. Hate crimes in Connecticut went from 87 in 2021 to 130 in 2024.
The numbers can numb us to what has been happening. Each crime, and incident, represents a traumatic event that can live with the victim for a lifetime. And when an individual is targeted because of who he or she is, damage is done to that individual’s entire community. As ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt put it: “Hate crimes deserve priority because of their special impact. They not only hurt one victim, but they also intimidate and isolate a victim’s whole community and weaken the bonds of our society.”
Concerned about what was happening, the Connecticut legislature passed a law creating the Hate Crimes Advisory Council (HCAC). Pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes Section 51-279f, the council is responsible for encouraging and coordinating programs that increase community awareness and reporting of hate crimes. It also is charged with making recommendations for legislation concerning hate crimes, including recommendations on restitution for victims, and alternative sentencing programs for juveniles and first-time offenders. 
The committee members, appointed by the governor, represent a diverse group of people from the private sector, police authorities, and state government. Consistent with its charge, the HCAC has been busily engaged in a wide variety of initiatives. Here are some of the most significant.
Website: A website has been created through the efforts of Amy Lin Meyerson, co-chair of the HCAC. It contains information about the HCAC and its activities, including membership, meeting dates meeting agendas, meeting minutes, hate crimes laws, and other information. Improvements to the website are now being studied.
Regular meetings: Meetings of the HCAC are held every other month. They typically involve discussions of what is being done by the HCAC’s many subcommittees, what initiatives are being undertaken, and invited speakers who are experts in the hate crimes area, or who represent various of the communities affected by hate crimes.
The communities include but are not limited to the Black, Jewish, trans, Asian, handicapped and Sikh communities. Hybrid meetings, held in person at the Office of the Chief States Attorney, 300 Corporate Place, Rocky Hill, are open to the public.
Investigative form: Ensuring that law enforcement is equipped to effectively investigate hate crimes has been a top priority. In collaboration with the Police Officer Standards and Training Council (POSTC), the council developed a model policy guiding officers on how to identify, investigate and rapidly report hate crimes and bias-related incidents. Police departments across the state have adopted and implemented this policy.
Third party reporting portal: It is an article of faith that hate crimes are radically underreported for a number of reasons, including the reluctance of victims to contact police authorities due to distrust or concern about immigration status. 
While we encourage individuals to report hate incidents to local law enforcement, we concluded that an alternative public reporting tool would encourage people who prefer not to deal with police authorities to report their victimization. Working with community stakeholders an online portal is being created to permit victims to report hate crimes and hate incidents without contacting police authorities. 
Cooperation with state and federal authorities. The HCAC has worked with federal and state law enforcement authorities to coordinate efforts. Police authorities have supported the council’s efforts from the start. 
In particular, the HCAC has worked closely with the office of the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP). Ronnell Higgins, who has aggressively supported increased investigation of and prosecution for hate crimes. Specifically, the State Police created a Hate Crimes Investigative Unit in July 2022, which is dedicated to staying on top of trends, sharing information with other police authorities, and organizing awareness events throughout the state at which unit speakers explain hate laws to attendees and discuss hate crimes enforcement in all its aspects. 
The Office of the Chief States Attorney, Patrick J. Griffin, has actively worked with the HCAC to study possible improvements in our laws and develop more effective law enforcement strategies for investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. States Attorney Griffin has actively supported the work of the council, assisted in proposing legislation, and made fighting hate crimes a priority of the state’s attorneys around the state.
Outreach: The HCAC has joined state and federal authorities, including the Investigative Unit and F.B.I., in reaching out to mosques, synagogues, churches, and local communities to create working relationships and inform town residents about what state and federal authorities are doing to fight hate crimes. It has sought to urge residents to report hate crimes or hateful activities—such as leafletting by white supremacist or neo-Nazi actors– if they occur. Public meetings, often organized by the state police, are being held all throughout the state to inform citizens about efforts being made to fight hate crimes.
Filing of annual reports: Annual reports, found on the website, are filed to outline what has been accomplished in the previous year.
Public awareness advertisement: A 30-second public awareness spot has been created informing the public what they can do if they have been victimized by a hate crime and informing the public about the existence of the online portal.  The spot should be shown on various sites in a matter of weeks. Some final issues need to be evaluated before the advertisement can be released. 
Legislative efforts and proposals: The HCAC’s charge includes recommending possible changes in the law relating to hate crimes. The HCAC has spent a great deal of time considering whether to ask the legislature to consider adopting various legislative changes including consolidating and amending the present patchwork of hate crimes laws and permitting members of a victim’s community to make a victim impact statement about the effect of a hate crime on the community of which a victim is a part.
Hate crimes and hateful incidents not only harm individuals but also spread fear through the community of which a victim is a part and corrode our civic sensibilities. They also tear at the social fabric of our multi-ethnic democracy which, for all its challenges, is still a miraculous achievement. 
We invite everyone concerned with this issue to attend meetings of the HCAC and go to local events presented by law enforcement.
After all, we are all in this together.

Matt Woods, R-Jasper, won election to Senate District 5 Tuesday night.
As of 9:16 p.m. Tuesday, Woods had 7,707 votes (86%) in unofficial returns for the north central Alabama Senate district, which includes Lamar, Fayette, Walker, the northern half of Tuscaloosa County, and the western part of Jefferson County. Democratic nominee Ryan Cagle, a progressive faith leader and community organizer and the first Democrat to run for the office since 2010, conceded around 9 p.m. At 9:16 p.m., he had 1,238 votes (13.1%).
A message seeking comment was left with Woods Tuesday night. Cagle in his concession statement congratulated Woods and said his “heart remains full and the fight continues.”
“We were outnumbered and out funded in every way, but we made incredible strides this campaign. In the face of insurmountable odds we have planted seeds that I know are going to continue to grow and blossom,” he said in the statement.

In a previous interview, Woods said he wants to continue and build on the district’s conservative leadership and bring his experience in the House, where he focused on education policy, to the Senate. Cagle offered a different vision and campaigned on bringing change to the district, saying he believes that established politicians have long ignored it and are not attentive to and aware of the region’s needs.
The seat was previous held by former Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Reed, R-Jasper, who resigned the seat at the start of the year to join Gov. Kay Ivey’s administration as Senior Advisor to Workforce Transformation. As Senate leader, Reed was a strong ally of business interests, expanding tax incentives and workforce training.
The seat is strongly Republican. Reed first won the seat in 2010 as a first-time candidate with 73.3% of the votes. Reed subsequently ran unopposed in the Republican primaries and was not challenged by a Democratic candidate in 2014, 2018 and 2022, according to Ballotpedia.
David Boyett, probate judge in Lamar County, described the turnout as “very low” and “not a normal turnout by no means,” but that significantly more people showed up to vote compared to the Democratic primary held in March, where the county recorded 38 votes.
“We’ve been out and visited the majority of the precincts all day today, and I’m looking at a very low turnout. I’m seeing somewhere around 400 total votes cast so far,” Boyette said Tuesday afternoon.
Woods also said he was seeing a low turnout earlier in the day, but that he expected more people to show up in the evening.
“We think there will be an uptick when people get off work,” he said in a text message.
Cagle, when asked what kind of turnout he was seeing, said in a text message Tuesday afternoon, “honestly I don’t know because I’m at work! #workingclassproblems.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Matt-Woods-1024x683.png,,,2025-06-24 23:02:16.969700

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington lawmakers and the governor Tuesday got the grim state revenue news they’ve been expecting.
Estimates show tax collections for the two-year operating budget that begins July 1 will be hundreds of millions of dollars less than what they assumed when they passed the budget that Gov. Bob Ferguson signed last month.
Revenues are lagging as consumers grow cautious and businesses retrench in response to the Trump Administration’s shifting approach on tariffs and trade. Many people are also tightening their spending while Congress ponders cuts to federal programs like Medicaid and food stamps.
The decline in receipts will force the state to draw down savings, but Ferguson isn’t summoning the Legislature into a special session to respond.
At least not yet.
“While this revenue forecast is disappointing, it is not surprising. At this time, I do not anticipate calling a special session,” Ferguson said in a statement. “We are closely monitoring developments from the federal government that could force me to revisit that question. We will also carefully review the next revenue forecast in September.”
Democratic and Republican budget writers shared the not-quite-yet assessment after Washington’s chief economist, Dave Reich, delivered the quarterly estimates to the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council.
“Certainly, I think we don’t have to come back for a special session,” said Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, the lead budget writer in the Senate. “I don’t see any reason today that the governor would ask us to do that, but that is his prerogative, not ours.”
Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Kalama, the Republican on the House Finance Committee, pointed out that lawmakers will begin their next scheduled session only about six months into the next biennium. 
“When we come back in January, we would have time to make some adjustments in the budget to make sure that we do not end up going negative by the end of the biennium,” he said. 
It will be a different story if the downward trend in collections is repeated in the September and November forecasts, he said.
By the numbers
Tuesday’s sobering update follows a tense legislative session in which the Legislature’s Democratic majority and the first-term Democrat governor overrode Republican opposition to approve spending reductions and tax increases to counter a shortfall Ferguson pegged at $16 billion.
That final budget calls for $77.8 billion in spending across government, including public schools and colleges, health care, social services, housing, corrections, and environmental protection. 
It paid the tab with $71 billion in tax collections plus more than a billion in cash reserves and roughly $4.3 billion from new and higher taxes that will begin to kick in later this year. The state will end the fiscal cycle with $80 million in cash reserves and $2 billion in its emergency, or rainy day, fund.
Tuesday’s forecast puts a kink in the equation.
Setting aside the anticipated boost from the new taxes, it shows the state will haul in $490 million less in the 2025-27 budget, and revenues will drop another $638 million in the 2027-29 cycle. However, the net decline is pegged at $720 million because revenues for the current budget will be $407 million higher than forecast in March.
When all the adding and subtracting is done, the state’s general fund will be operating with razor-thin savings. 
“We believe the budget can weather the negative economic impacts we see in this forecast driven by federal action,” state Rep. Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, the lead Republican budget writer for House Republicans, said the majority party’s overspending, not federal policies, are to blame for the situation.
“This crisis was made in Olympia, not Washington, D.C.,” he said. “Slower growth in sales tax and real estate tax should have been a flashing red light. Instead, Democrats plowed ahead with the largest budget in state history, no cushion, no discipline, and no plan. They spent us into a deficit before the ink even dried.”
Ferguson has already directed state agencies to look for more cuts in their budgets.
“This will not be easy. We already made many difficult decisions last session,” he said. “Washingtonians expect us as leaders to make the tough decisions to live within our means and still deliver core services.”
Bracing for federal fallout

Meanwhile, the governor met with six other statewide elected officials Tuesday morning to discuss how best to respond if the Trump administration and Congress stanch the flow of federal funds to the state.
Since taking office, the administration has delayed, frozen, canceled, or threatened to block numerous grants, in some instances triggering legal action by Washington and other states.
And the Republican-controlled Congress is considering proposed budget legislation that would sharply reduce federal funds for Medicaid, food assistance and other significant programs.
“We explored strategies for how to best protect core services for Washington communities reliant on federal funding without giving in to the Trump Administration’s attacks,” Ferguson said in a statement after the meeting.

(Capital-Star file)The state Senate has passed a bill that would eliminate out-of-pocket costs for follow-up breast imaging after a mammogram detects an abnormality.
Under current state law, insurance companies must fully cover mammograms for those over the age of 40 – in some cases, younger with a doctor’s recommendation. They also have to provide no-cost coverage of follow-up MRI’s and ultrasounds for those at high risk for breast cancer.
Listen to Emily’s audio recap here:

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24epBCFOLOweb.mp3
 
Senate Bill 88 would expand that to mandate no-cost coverage for patients regardless of risk, if a previous screening detected an abnormality or their doctor recommends it. 
Sponsor Sen. Frank Farry (R-Bucks) said his wife has battled breast cancer during the past 18 months.
“Some initial diagnostic screenings are inconclusive. They show something, but it’s not a clear diagnosis. And, unfortunately, [patients] may have to pay for further diagnostic testing to find out if they have breast cancer,” Farry said. “I know the challenges our family has faced. And we are very blessed to have good health insurance and access to wonderful health care providers in southeastern Pennsylvania. But not every Pennsylvanian can say that.”
Co-sponsors include Sen. Tracy Pennycuick (R-Berks/Montgomery), whose 21-year-old daughter and half a dozen other relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer. 
Another is state Sen. Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), herself a breast cancer survivor.
“I see every day, young women who don’t really even qualify for any kind of breast cancer screening, they have breast cancer,” Ward said. “And if they hadn’t pushed forward on their own, maybe paid for some of that care, we’d never know that they had breast cancer until it’s way too late.”
Ward has been a leader in expanding breast cancer prevention coverage in the commonwealth. 
Out-of-pocket costs for follow-up imaging often exceed $1,000, according to Pat Halpin-Murphy, president and founder of Pennsylvania Breast Cancer Coalition. 
Halpin-Murphy said she’s seen bills far beyond that, including a recent one for more than $4,700.
About 20 percent of patients say they would skip breast cancer screenings and follow-up exams if they had to pay a deductible, according to a study published in Radiology in 2022. 
“Early detection means nothing, if patients can’t afford the diagnostic imaging needed to confirm or rule out cancer,” said Sen. Devlin Robinson (R-Allegheny). “This bill closes that gap.”
Coverage would begin in 2027, if the House passes Senate Bill 88 in time for Gov. Josh Shapiro to sign it before the end of October, Halpin-Murphy confirmed.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/state-capitol-harrisburg-copy-1024x460.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 21:00:45.845962

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Dueling House and Senate mini-budgets complicate the chances of the legislature approving a stop-gap spending measure before the start of the new fiscal year. 
The state House will not pass the mini-budget the Senate approved Tuesday. 
Instead, the House budget committee voted on its own slimmed-down spending plans. 
Republican budget writers in the House and Senate have been unable to bridge their considerable differences over spending and future taxation. They are not on track to approve a comprehensive budget before July 1. 
Legislators plan to take a weeks-long break beginning this week. They are talking about returning to Raleigh for a few days each month if they have bills to approve. A comprehensive budget could come up for a vote later this summer. 
House Speaker Destin Hall said the month-to-month schedule could continue into next year, when the regular “short session” begins. 
State law allows spending to continue into the next fiscal year at previously approved levels, even without a new budget. But new initiatives won’t be funded, and state employees and teachers won’t know about their raises. 
After the Senate approved its mini-budget on a 39-6 vote, Hall said his chamber would not agree to it. 
The Senate’s bill “kind of creeps over into trying to get as close to a comprehensive budget as possible without having one,” he said. 
While Hall was talking to reporters, the House budget committee began discussing its spending bills. 
One includes 2.5% raises for state employees, raises teacher pay next year by an average of 6.4%, and reduces vacant state positions by 20% across state agencies. 
A second bill includes money for about a dozen items and puts money into the state building fund.

(Photo provided by the Missile Defense Agency)A new bill in Congress cosponsored by Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan calls for the federal government to spend almost a billion dollars on new military projects in Alaska.
The Golden Dome Act, cosponsored by the Alaska Republican; Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-North Dakota; and Rep. Mark Messmer, R-Indiana, seeks to implement a presidential executive order that calls for the creation of an extended missile defense system for the United States.
Envisioned by the president and modeled after Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, the Senate proposal envisions a system that could protect the United States against long-range missiles fired by a foreign country.
Overall, the act authorizes more than $23 billion to buy new missiles and build and plan new facilities.
That figure is on top of $25 billion earmarked for missile defense in the under-construction budget reconciliation bill, colloquially known as the Big, Beautiful Bill.
Sullivan has been a longtime proponent of America’s current limited missile defense system, which includes a large radar system in the Aleutian Islands and missiles based in underground silos at Fort Greely, near Delta Junction.
The effectiveness of that system and similar efforts has been repeatedly questioned, and tests have not shown that it is effective against significant numbers of missiles or when decoys or other countermeasures are used, a March 2025 report concluded.
The first-draft text of the Golden Dome Act, posted online Tuesday, calls for $460 million to be spent on new missiles and missile silos at Fort Greely.
Another $500 million is earmarked for a separate, as-yet-unbuilt missile defense system known as “Aegis Ashore.” 
The Aegis missile system is ordinarily used by the U.S. Navy, and after several successful uses, proponents have called for ground-based Aegis missiles as well.
The $500 million would cover planning, site selection and construction of an Aegis Ashore facility in Alaska. Additional funding may be needed to complete that project.
Additional money is earmarked for the Cobra Dane radar system in the Aleutians, currently used to track objects in space.
During a news conference, Sullivan noted that on Monday, the missile defense radar at Clear Space Force Station, near Healy, tracked a live intercontinental ballistic missile in a test for the first time since being upgraded in 2021.
The test had been delayed for more than three years due to a variety of problems, including the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“It was a huge success,” Sullivan said of the test. “We can do this. The Golden Dome Act will ensure a long-term statutory framework that will make us safer and cement this critical national security initiative into the laws of our nation.”

(U.S. Forest Service)A Republican proposal in the U.S. Senate that could have put millions of acres of public land in Washington up for sale has hit a roadblock, but the lead lawmaker behind the idea is planning to press ahead with a scaled-back version. 
This piece of a sprawling GOP tax cut and spending bill would have required the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service to sell between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public lands across 11 Western states within the next five years. There were 5.4 million acres in Washington that could have been included in those potential sales.
But on Monday, the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian said this proposal did not comply with rules that would allow for it to be fast-tracked as part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
U.S. Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, who is spearheading the land sale provisions, outlined changes he planned to make in a social media post on Monday. 
These included removing all Forest Service land from the proposal and limiting the amount of Bureau of Land Management acreage to parcels within five miles of population centers. Lee also said he wanted to establish “FREEDOM ZONES to ensure these lands benefit AMERICAN FAMILIES” and “PROTECT our farmers, ranchers, and recreational users.” 
Opponents still see a battle ahead.
“I don’t trust him and I don’t trust his process,” said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. “We will be here to the last minute, making sure that they do not succeed in putting this into a bill, and if they do, we will be there with an amendment fighting it tooth and nail on the floor.” 
If Forest Service property is removed from the bill, it would dramatically downsize how much land could be affected in Washington. Of the 5.4 million acres covered in the state by the original proposal, only 344,252 acres are Bureau of Land Management parcels, according to data released by the Wilderness Society. 
Lee’s proposed limit to land within five miles of a population center would likely further reduce that amount of acreage. 
But even if Lee revises his proposal in the way he described, Cantwell said high-traffic recreation sites in the Columbia River Gorge and the Methow River Valley, and sagebrush hunting grounds in the Columbia Basin could be included. 
Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, who is also a Democrat, has spoken out against the proposed public land sell-off as well.
And Gov. Bob Ferguson said Monday that he and his team were “exploring our options if this shortsighted proposal moves forward.” 
Before the GOP-backed tax policy and spending bill cleared the House, Republicans in that chamber scrapped a proposal to make 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah available for sale. They did so following bipartisan opposition from public land activists, the outdoor recreation community, and conservation groups. 
“It’s no secret that some Republicans have wanted to do this,” said Conservation Northwest Senior Policy Director Paula Swedeen. 
Swedeen raised concerns about how land sales could carve up wildlife habitat or lead to development in areas at risk of wildfire.
Groups that opposed the provision in the House anticipated that Republicans would revive a public land sale proposal in the Senate, said Jonathan Owen, director of the Olympic Peninsula conservation group Wild Olympics Campaign. 
The now-blocked Senate version of the plan would have required the interior and agriculture secretaries to select between 0.5% and 0.75% of eligible lands to dispose of via competitive sale, auction, “or other methods designed to secure not less than fair market value.” 
“Something like this has never been done before at this scale and would be a slippery slope,” Owen said. 
Along with Washington, the Senate plan called for making lands eligible for sale in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. About 250 million acres of land, including the 5.4 million acres in Washington state, would have been eligible for sale. 
In Washington, this included parcels in the Olympic National Forest, the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the Snoqualmie National Forest, the Okanogan National Forest, the Mt. Baker National Forest, the Alpine Lakes Wilderness and the Wild Sky Wilderness. 
Lee has said previously that his goal was to open “underused” federal land for housing. But critics said there was no requirement that the land be used for home construction.
In Lee’s original proposal, 5% of the revenue from each land sale would be given to local governments for infrastructure to support housing development, 5% would be earmarked for land maintenance, and the rest of the money would go to the general federal coffers.
In recent congressional testimony, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum described the targeted areas as “barren land next to highways with existing billboards that have no recreational value.”
Others disagree. Lauren McClean, mayor of Boise, Idaho, said Tuesday during a press conference hosted by Cantwell that the land that was potentially up for sale includes access to trailheads and other recreational sites. 
“In this proposal, the sale of public lands would potentially block access to the over 200 miles of trails that we have that lead from our city into open spaces,” McLean said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/okanogan-wenatchee-national-forest-sign-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-06-24 21:00:45.845962

Department of Education directed that American institutions of higher learning halt any “hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies, and all other aspects of student, academic, and campus life” related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
The directive on DEI drew immediate (and successful) legal challenges nationally, but rather than wait for their outcome, the University of Alaska’s Board of Regents moved with alacrity to embrace it. Within the week, it had ordered university President Pat Pitney to comply with the federal mandates and instruct her chancellors to, among other things, assure that “the Universities’ websites and other electronic or print material representing each‬ university, no longer refer to “affirmative action,” “DEI” nor utilize the words “diversity,” “equity,” “inclusion,” or other associated terms‬.”
In adopting a policy explicitly rejecting DEI, the regents demonstrated the nature of anticipatory obedience: acting to comply in advance of any pressure to do so in order to avoid potential consequences from some higher authority.
It was clear that the regents were motivated to protect the university and its dependence on federal funding that was threatened. It is natural for us as human beings to take steps to avoid pain and maximize survival.
And it is that instinct that authoritarian regimes take immediate and full advantage of, forcing conformity through targeted actions against one or a few institutions so that others will retreat in fear.
In his maximalist assault on American institutions in his first months in office, President Trump demonstrated his mastery of coercion. His war on higher education began with attacks on Columbia University and other “elite” schools for their antisemitism. Threatened with cuts of tens of millions in federal funding, Columbia immediately capitulated. Northwestern University promptly announced steps it was taking to comply, but did not escape the loss of funding. Hundreds of America’s universities took notice. 
Harvard University, while acknowledging that changes were warranted, refused to comply with the Trump directives, leading to escalating steps by Trump to crush Harvard’s resistance: curbing hundreds of millions in grants, threatening to revoke its tax exempt status and to bar foreign students from enrolling. Harvard’s defiance has found vindication in the courts and emboldened other institutions of higher learning to defend their independence from unprecedented government intrusion.
The Trump administration initiated parallel assaults on other pillars of American society, issuing executive orders, for example, barring certain law firms from interacting with federal agencies on behalf of their respective clients. In almost all cases, the identified firms had either employed lawyers or represented clients adverse to his interests. Some of the most noteworthy law firms in the country capitulated to the pressure, ultimately entering into agreements requiring them to provide pro bono services on behalf of the administration nearing $1 billion in value. Other well-known law firms refused to be coerced, viewing the administration’s actions as a distortion of American justice and the role of attorneys to provide diligent representation. 
No court has upheld the claims the Trump administration has made in court to defend its actions. Nevertheless, as Scott Cummings, professor of ethics at the UCLA School of Law, has noted, Trump’s assault on law firms has had a deliberately powerful chilling effect. “Already, many firms are declining to take on cases that challenge the administration’s policies. That’s not a side effect of the crackdown. It was the purpose all along.”
All of us must resist the temptation to acquiesce into anticipatory obedience. The greater the urge to conform, the greater the power of a regime to impose it without having to lift a finger. If the Trump administration can so quickly coerce leading segments of our society to back away from principles that we have historically espoused, we should expect that further intrusions on both institutional and individual liberty will quickly follow.

(Courtesy of Douglas County)OMAHA — The Douglas County Board appears poised to appoint a retired chief deputy of the County Treasurer’s Office to fill the top spot in the office left open this spring when John Ewing Jr. was elected mayor of Omaha.
During its weekly meeting Tuesday, the Douglas County Board discussed the legal process of filling the position, essentially the county’s banker who oversees the collection of taxes. Ewing had about 18 months left in his elected treasurer’s term when he submitted a resignation letter June 6 so he could begin mayoral duties.
County Board Chair Roger Garcia told the board he preferred a “non-political option” to fill the term: Tim Cavanaugh, who had served as chief deputy of the Treasurer’s Office. Cavanaugh retired in January 2021. Cavanaugh, also a retired Omaha Police captain, currently serves on the elected board of the Metropolitan Utilities District. (State law would allow him to serve in both positions simultaneously.)

The County Board did not vote on an appointment. Garcia said he preferred to discuss the potential appointment this week, followed by a formal vote July 8. No commissioner publicly objected to Cavanaugh. 
Commissioners said they had received calls from interested parties, though no other contender was identified during the discussion. Board member P.J. Morgan said that Cavanaugh, who is not related to Board member Jim Cavanaugh, would be an “excellent choice.”
Jane Alexander more recently has served as Ewing’s chief deputy. She told the Nebraska Examiner earlier this month that she was not interested in pursuing the treasurer’s job permanently. 
Garcia was among several who had approached Alexander about the opportunity, and he noted a couple of barriers, including the residency requirement, that led her to opt out. She lives in Sarpy County. He said that Alexander told him that she supported the appointment of Cavanaugh to fill the post until the next treasurer is elected in November 2026 and takes office the following January.

Garcia said his preference is to have a team that knows and could “take care of the office” and operations until the public could elect the next treasurer. 
Garcia said that both Cavanaugh and Alexander have expressed that they would not run for election to the post.
Board members Tuesday also approved a motion to increase Alexander’s salary to reflect her leadership of the office until an interim is formally appointed.
Under law, the board has 45 days, or until around July 21, to fill Ewing’s position.

Raghib Allie-Brennan said his arrest on a shoplifting charge was due to his failure to scan two items at a Target store in Bethel.,"State Rep. Raghib Allie-Brennan, D-Bethel, said Tuesday on social media that his arrest on a shoplifting charge Monday evening was due to his failure to scan two items as he used the self-checkout at a Target store in Bethel.
“I was in a rush to bring items to my grandmother in the hospital, the store didn’t have bags, and I was juggling multiple purchases,” Allie-Brennan said in a post on Facebook.
He was issued a misdemeanor summons for 6th-degree larceny.
A Bethel police summary of his arrest stated Allie-Brennan was detained by Target loss prevention personnel who told police they recognized him from “previous unreported larcenies.”
He was arrested after police reviewed security video showing him attempting to leave the store with $26.69 in unpaid merchandise, police said. The summary provided no further details.
Allie-Brennan, 33, a four-term lawmaker first elected in 2018, did not respond to a request for comment beyond his statement on social media, which did not directly address the accusation of previous thefts.
“While I do not have a record, I take full responsibility for the error and am working through the legal processes to resolve the matter quickly and respectfully,” he said on Facebook.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said in a statement he has spoken to Allie-Brennan, who represents portions of Bethel and Danbury.
“He recognizes the high standard to which I hold our members and is taking responsibility for inadvertently leaving the Target self-checkout without scanning several items,” Ritter said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/190109-state-of-the-state-Raghib-Allie-Brennan-1.jpg,,,2025-06-24 21:00:45.845962

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout 2025)The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee is suing the state over a new law that created a felony charge for elected officials who vote in support of sanctuary policies for immigrants.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Davidson County Chancery Court on behalf of seven members of the Metro Nashville Council, argues that the law violates local elected officials’ First Amendment right to free speech.
The statute creates a Class E felony for local public officials who vote to adopt a “sanctuary policy” and requires any official who violates the law to be removed from office “as soon as practicable.” The charge is punishable by up to six years in prison and a $3,000 fine.
“This law infringes on the constitutional protections I have as a legislator: to do what is best for my constituents without fear of interference,” Metro Councilmember at large Zulfat Suara, one of the plaintiffs, stated. “We must not allow the state to usurp these protections. As a public official and an immigrant, I cannot accept a law that makes compassion a crime. Many immigrant families already live in fear — if they come after immigrants, who will they come for next?”
Suara is joined in the suit by Council members Clay Capp (District 6), Brenda Gadd (District 24), Sandra Sepulveda (District 30), Terry Vo (District 17), Ginny Welsch (District 16), and Delishia Porterfield (Council member at large).
Bill criminalizing votes for immigrant sanctuary policies ‘constitutionally suspect’

Representatives for Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk, who are named as defendants in the suit, were not immediately available for comment.
District 25 Metro Council member and attorney Jeff Preptit is representing his fellow council members as co-counsel on the suit alongside ACLU-TN Legal Director Stella Yarbrough and Ben Gastel, Preptit’s colleague at Herzfeld, Suetholz, Gastel, Leniski and Wall PLLC. 
“This legislation makes it a felony for local leaders to do the job our communities elected them to do,” Preptit said in a news release. “Local leaders shouldn’t face criminal charges for passing policies that reflect the values and safety concerns of our neighbors — especially when those policies ensure trust between residents and local government.”
The provision is part of a broad-ranging immigration enforcement plan spearheaded by Gov. Bill Lee’s administration to align with the Trump administration’s immigration policy. Lee signed the bill into law in February after it passed in a special legislative session with strong support from the Tennessee General Assembly’s Republican supermajority.
Sen. Todd Gardenhire, the Republican chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Democratic senators in voting against the measure after calling it a “dangerous precedent.”
Prior to the law’s passage, First Amendment, government accountability and legal experts said the law was “constitutionally suspect.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson said in an emailed statement in January that “requiring localities and public officials to comply with federal law is not a matter of public opinion” and that the criminal penalties “reflect the overwhelming belief of our constituents” regarding support for the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement.
A 2019 Tennessee law already prohibits the adoption of “sanctuary policies,” broadly defined as any formal or informal policy that in any way limits state or local government cooperation with federal immigration agencies. That law allows the state to withhold grant funding from jurisdictions that adopt such policies, and gives citizens the right to file a civil suit challenging policies they suspect of violating the law.

Henry McMaster, surrounded by legislators and agency directors, shows a bill he signed combining three health care agencies into one at the state's health care campus in Cayce on Tuesday, June 24, 2025. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)CAYCE — Residents with substance abuse disorders, disabilities and mental health needs will be able to more easily access state services under a law the governor ceremonially signed Tuesday.
The bill, which Gov. Henry McMaster actually signed into law in April, created the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities by combining three agencies — the departments of mental health, disabilities, and alcohol and drug abuse services — into one.
“What we are doing here today is going to change our state,” McMaster said. “It is going to fix some things that have been going on for a while.”
Divisions of the new agency, overseen by the former agency heads, will administer services for mental health, disabilities and substance abuse. But people with concurrent issues, such as mental health concerns that lead to substance abuse, will no longer have to go through a disjointed and inefficient system bogged down by bureaucracy, officials said.
SC public health overhaul could be resurrected, senator says: ‘It’s not trivial.’

South Carolina’s public health system was the most fragmented in the country, according to a 2024 independent study the state commissioned. Senate President Thomas Alexander, one of the bill’s lead sponsors, compared the process to ping-pong, since a person looking for services was likely to get bounced around among the agencies.
“So many of the individuals that need care by one of those agencies needs care by another agency,” the Walhalla Republican said. “We’ve kind of had that silo system here in South Carolina.”
It’s unclear whether consolidating the agencies and creating more efficient processes will mean cutting positions, officials said Tuesday. The state’s human resources department has until June 2026 to officially streamline services by removing duplicative efforts.
The agency’s approximately 450 Columbia-area employees are working out of the state’s new health campus in Cayce. The campus, which also houses the Department of Public Health, was once the site of the now-defunct SC Electric & Gas Company, as well as its parent company, SCANA.
Who will lead the agency is still up in the air. The law put the agency under McMaster’s Cabinet, allowing him to nominate a director for Senate approval. That director will answer directly to the governor.
The Department of Public Health was also a product of a restructuring bill. In 2023, McMaster signed a bill splitting the massive Department of Health and Environmental Control into two separate Cabinet agencies.
  Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort, speaks about a bill combining three health care agencies into one at the state’s health care campus on Tuesday, June 24, 2025. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)
A previous version of the health care agency combination bill would have wrapped the newly created Department of Public Health into the new health care agency, along with the Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, and the Department on Aging.
The bill died on the final day of the 2024 legislative session, as members of the Freedom Caucus who opposed the bill ran out the clock before the House could give it a final vote. The proposal would consolidate too much power under a single person, creating a “health czar,” said opponents in the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.
By removing the Department of Public Health from the fold, this year’s bill passed with almost no opposition.
Despite including fewer agencies, the version that became law still addressed the most vital issues people faced accessing services, said Sen. Tom Davis, a longtime champion of restructuring the health care system.
“The one thing that came up over and over again, and that (the report) stressed over everything else, was that DDSN, DMH and DAODAS have overlapping populations, and if you do nothing else, take care of this,” the Beaufort Republican said. “Government is all about good, not perfect.”
The state’s restructuring began more than 30 years ago, with former Gov. Carroll Campbell’s major consolidation of state government in the early 1990s. The combination of health agencies celebrated Tuesday completes that goal, Davis said.
“Today, I think we can declare restructuring complete,” Davis said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4087-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 20:05:19.467533

(Photo courtesy of Iowa DNR) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is investigating an oil spill that entered the West Nishnabotna River from a truck stop near Avoca.
The spill follows a complaint of discharged petroleum at the same Eagles Landing Flying J Truckstop from this spring that the DNR was still investigating and working to help clean up when Tuesday’s spill was observed. 
Alison Manz, an environmental specialist senior with the DNR, said it’s unknown how much petroleum entered the river, though she believes the spill was caught “right at the very beginning” of the plume.
Absorbent booms and other clean-up tools were placed immediately downstream in an effort to contain the petroleum from spreading and, as of Tuesday, no dead fish had been observed in the river.

Several months ago, when the department investigated the previous complaint regarding petroleum contamination at the same site just north of Avoca off Interstate 80, the staff found a “bigger issue” when they realized petroleum was being discharged into a stormwater retention basin.
Manz said the retention basin has been plugged and is “completely contained” but clean-up for the roadside ditch and culverts connected to the retention basin has been an ongoing process. “We don’t know how long that basin has been draining into the roadside ditch,” Manz said. 
Recent heavy rains impacted the clean-up process of the ditches and caused an unknown amount of petroleum to flow into the West Nishnabotna River.
“I don’t know if we’re ever going to know what the quantity that went to the river is, because all the residual that’s in the soil and in the culverts … we’re never going to know quantity,” Manz said. 
She said the DNR has “no idea” how long the retention basin had been contaminated with petroleum discharges and draining into the ditch before the spring complaint brought it to the department’s attention. 
A press release from the DNR said Eagles Landing has been cooperating with the clean-up activities, which Manz said will be extensive. Before the crews can clean and drain the plugged retention basin, they must excavate the roadside ditch and clean the culverts. 
The department must also find the source of the leak. “We know that it’s coming from Eagles Landing, but we don’t know where,” Manz said. 
In 2011, the same facility had a leaking underground storage tank but it received a “no action required” classification by the department following site assessments and cleanup. 
Jessica Montana, the supervisor for the DNR’s field office in Atlantic, said the facility had to have monthly monitoring reports conducted by a certified groundwater professional submitted to DNR. 
Montana said the facility was in compliance and was “spot on” with submitting the reports. 
The spring complaint and subsequent spill into the West Nishnabotna, however, means the DNR must investigate whether this petroleum is coming from a new leak or from the previously identified leaking underground storage tank. 
“We’re still investigating what was released, and where, and why, and we’re still determining the source,” Montana said. 
The DNR has advised the public to avoid the contaminated area on the river.

Partizanfilm, a new nonprofit art house movie theater, is set to open this fall in downtown Burlington — just around the corner from the former location of Merrill’s Roxy Cinema, which closed in November.
Five Burlington residents purchased a commercial condominium located at 230 College St., which has been vacant since the Restock Shop, a low-waste store selling refillable personal care items, closed two years ago. The owners hope to renovate the space to make it a two-screen “microcinema” that shows first-run independent and foreign films seven days a week, in addition to the occasional older film.
Partizanfilms announced construction plans for the theater June 15. More than 130 people have joined the cooperative through paid memberships, and an additional 120 volunteers offered to assist with its opening, according to Brett Yates, the nonprofit’s president and one of its five founding board members.
“People are really eager to see it, to see another movie theater get going,” he said.
Yates and the four other board members have been planning to launch Partizanfilm since the Roxy’s owner announced its closure, he said.

As Vermont’s biggest city and cultural center, Burlington felt incomplete without a movie theater, and the closure of its only cinema “felt like a slight” to the city, Yates said.
Yates spent part of his 20s working in movie theaters and now works as a ski lift operator and freelance journalist. His wife, Michelle Sagalchik, a high school U.S. history and civics teacher; Antonio Golán, a communications lecturer at the University of Vermont; Gretchen Schissel, a curricular program specialist at the university; and Ali Hamedani, a physical therapist round out the founding board members. 
None of the five founders have run a business before. But when they learned that no existing business planned to reopen a downtown theater, they decided to take matters into their own hands by launching a grassroots effort to create a member-operated nonprofit cinema.
“I don’t think any of us feel qualified,” Yates said. “We just wanted to do it, and I guess that’s our qualification, is that we wanted to do it.”
Merrill Jarvis III, the third-generation owner of the Roxy, previously told Seven Days he would place a deed restriction on the building if he sold it, preventing future owners from operating a movie theater there.
That restriction ended Sagalchik and her peers’ hopes that someone might step in to renovate and reopen a modernized cinema where the Roxy once stood. 

“Had it seemed more certain that the Roxy would be up for sale with the possibility of being renovated into a movie theater, we would have trusted and hoped that someone would take on that project,” said Sagalchik. “But we sort of doubt that is going to happen.”
When asked in an interview for his response to the new theater’s plans to open, Jarvis declined to comment.
Yates and Sagalchik said they are not attempting to recreate the Roxy. Instead, their independent project aims to keep movie theaters alive by embracing a nonprofit model that solicits arts grants and tax deductible donations, which they said mirrors a broader trend in recent years of nonprofit art house theaters.
Community-centered cinema initiatives are also popping up elsewhere in Vermont, such as the reopening of The Bigger Picture in Waitsfield as a nonprofit, according to the Valley Reporter.
Partizanfilm plans to rely primarily on donations, grant funding and membership sales to stay in business. For an annual membership fee of $60, patrons get to pay $2.50 less per ticket than non-members. For non-members, tickets are slated to cost $12 in the evening, $8.50 for a weekend matinee and $7.50 for a weekday matinee.
The owners expect members to play a significant role in the theater’s direction and oversight through electing board members and weighing in on issues at annual meetings. The theater’s democratic governance structure is modeled after a consumer cooperative, according to Yates. 
However, Partizanfilm does not plan to issue patronage dividends. Instead, the owners expect to reinvest all revenue into the theater’s operations and programming, he said.
“We didn’t want to do it any other way,” Yates said. “We’re hoping that it will be an example that a business can be run democratically, and it can be run to serve a community’s needs.”
“Nobody is doing this to make money,” he added. “We’re all doing this together. We’re going to make decisions together, and we think it’s going to work.”
Outside of the film screening rooms, current plans are to put the lobby to use as a social area with a small bookstore and cafe serving beer, wine, coffee and snacks. Yates said he encourages the use of the space for post-viewing conversation or to simply to hang out. 
The founders envision the future theater functioning as a third space to foster connection not only among moviegoers, but also all who enter its doors, according to Yates.
“This will be a place where the energy will be right,” he said. “And I hope people will enjoy it as a place beyond just going to the movies.”
Sagalchik said the five-person team, all of whom reside in Burlington, has a natural affinity for mobilizing public support for grassroots efforts. 
“This is sort of an extension of that kind of organizing energy,” she said. 
Despite major renovations still pending, the theater’s owners are hopeful to be up and running by Nov. 1, Sagalchik said.

(Screenshot of SCETV Supreme Court livestream)COLUMBIA — A voter advocacy group and lawyers representing South Carolina’s General Assembly each made their case Tuesday to the state Supreme Court over whether the state’s post-census redrawing of congressional voting lines violate the state constitution.
Filing suit last July, the South Carolina League of Women Voters argued that political gerrymandering of the map redrawn by legislators and signed into law in January 2022 watered down Democrats’ influence in the coastal 1st District, to the point that it violates the state constitution’s guarantee of an “equal right to elect officers.”
  South Carolina League of Women Voters lawyer Allen Chaney argued before the state Supreme Court on Tuesday, June 24, 2025, in Columbia. (Screenshot of SCETV Supreme Court livestream)
In Wednesday’s hearing, justices said there’s nothing in the constitution specifically banning the consideration of politics in redrawing voting maps. They questioned how they can tell legally when the Legislature goes too far.
John Gore, the lawyer representing Senate Republicans, asked the court not “to wade into this political thicket.”
While questioning the League of Women Voters attorney, justices said they worried a ruling that sought to create political parity would unintentionally go too far and swing election results in the other party’s favor. In this case, that would mean favoring Democrats over the state’s ruling party.
“What I hear you saying is, you’re asking us to take it upon ourselves to decree who gets political power.” Justice George James said.
Chief Justice John Kittredge said it’s not the court’s place to give any party the edge.
“I don’t have the right to select the winner; I have the right to vote,” he said. “I don’t have the right to have a pity party and sour grapes if my candidate loses.”
Justice Leticia Verdin said the court can’t essentially “act as a Legislature” and redraw the lines with its decision.
The latest lawsuit followed a 6-3 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in May 2024 that tossed out an earlier case brought by South Carolina chapters of the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union arguing state legislators drew the coastal 1st District, held by Republican Nancy Mace, on racial lines.
In that case, staff and members of the GOP-controlled Legislature testified it was politics — not race — that influenced how the lines were redrawn following the 2020 Census.
The League of Women Voters pointed to that testimony, including statements from the lead map drawer that he was instructed by legislators to review how precincts voted in the 2020 presidential election and move them into new districts to create a Republican majority in the 1st District.
“I think the record is clear that elected officials use (political gerrymandering) and voters largely hate it,” said the organization’s legal director, Allen Chaney.
He recognized that the 1st District is the only one in the state swayed by making the Legislature try again on redrawing congressional maps.
But no voter, Democrat or Republican, has the right to decide the outcome of an election. The issue is whether one party’s influence has been intentionally diluted to give the other the advantage, he said.
  South Carolina Chief Justice Kittredge asks questions Tuesday, June 24,2025, of lawyers for the South Carolina League of Women Voters. (Screenshot of SCETV Supreme Court livestream)
“So, what does that mean?” Kittredge said, asking how to measure that. “Give us some guideposts that we could latch onto.”
In setting a potential precedent, the court needs “manageable standards,” James said, “instead of saying this just doesn’t look right.”
In response, Chaney said any future challenge to district lines would need to prove legislators purposefully tried to dilute someone’s vote based on whether they vote Republican or Democrat and accomplished that aim in a way that sways the results of an election.
But Gore, the lawyer for Senate Republicans, argued while politics was a factor in the maps’ drawing, it wasn’t the only factor.
Using Chaney’s suggestion to decide what crosses the line between an acceptable use of politics and what’s unconstitutional is problematic, said Andrew Mathias, the lawyer for House Republicans.
“It becomes so unmanageable that it’s arbitrary,” he said. “It is asking the court to call balls and strikes without a strike zone.”
Mathias and Gore went on to argue that voter preferences can change over time. And, in South Carolina, where people don’t register by party, voters can participate in either party’s primary, making it more of a guess of who’s Republican versus Democrat.
South Carolina’s 1st District has long been reliable for Republicans. However, a population explosion on the coast turned it more purple. In 2018, Democrat Joe Cunningham flipped the seat to blue for the first time in nearly 40 years.
Two years later, Mace ousted him by 1 percentage point, flipping the seat back to Republican control. After the post-census redrawing of lines, Mace easily won in 2022 against Democrat Annie Andrews.
Finally, lawyers for the Legislature argued, if South Carolinians do not like the results of an election or the way congressional lines are drawn, they have other ways of changing them that don’t involve the courts — they can chose to vote a politician out in the next election cycle or they can lobby the Legislature for a constitutional change outlawing political gerrymandering.
But Chaney said the very nature of political gerrymandering means those aren’t real options, because it reduces voters’ influence over their elected officials.
“It cannot be that the only check on this sort of inversion of representative democracy is convincing lawmakers to give away their own power,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-24-at-2.22.41 PM.jpg,,,2025-06-24 20:05:19.467533

Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, denies that the account that left the comment belongs to him despite allegations to the contrary.
In a phone interview Tuesday with West Virginia Watch, Masters said he didn’t have “any active Instagram account.”
“That is certainly not something I am typing or saying or believing,” Masters said, continuing to call the framing of the comment “bizarre.”
“Yeah, that is certainly not something — I mean, I’m not declaring who white people do and don’t claim, and that, that’s — no it’s just not a belief [of mine],” he continued, referring to antisemitism and the idea that “there’s declarations as to who is and is not white.”
A screenshot of the comment from @NoQuarterMasters was sent to West Virginia Watch on Monday. It was still posted and public on Instagram on Tuesday morning. Tuesday afternoon, Pushkin reached out independently to West Virginia Watch with a statement regarding the post.
Until Tuesday afternoon, the name on the @NoQuarterMasters account was Ian T. Masters and the link in the bio was for the West Virginia Citizen’s Defense League, a Second Amendment advocacy group where Masters served as president from 2015 until at least January 2025, when he was appointed by Gov. Patrick Morrisey to serve in the West Virginia House.
By 2:20 p.m. — after Masters’ conversation with West Virginia Watch — the name on the account was changed to I. Masters and the link to the state Citizens Defense League was removed from the bio.
  A screenshot of the @NoQuarterMasters Instagram account taken at 11:16 a.m. on Tuesday (left) shows the full name Ian T. Masters along with a link to the website for the West Virginia Citizens Defense League, where Masters served as president from 2015-2025. A screenshot of the same account taken at 2:20 p.m. Tuesday (right) — after Masters was interviewed by West Virginia Watch — shows the name on the account changed to I. Masters and the link for the WVCDL removed from the bio.
The profile picture on @NoQuarterMasters shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in West Virginia. The rest of the information in the letter is covered up by runes burnt into wooden pendants hanging from strings. 
The runes include several symbols listed by the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy organization dedicated to stopping anti-semitism across the world, as antisemitic symbols used by groups and individuals espousing white supremacist, neo-Nazi and antisemitic ideals. The runes include the Valknot, the Life Rune and the Wolfsangel, among others.
  A screenshot of the profile picture used on the @NoQuarterMasters Instagram account shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in West Virginia and several runes described by the Anti-Defamation League as being associated antisemitic views and groups.
According to Instagram, the last two digits of the phone number used for a password reset on the @NoQuarterMasters account match those from Masters’ personal cell phone number, which he used to return a phone call from a West Virginia Watch reporter on Tuesday.
When asked Tuesday if there was any chance someone would be impersonating him given all these connections, Masters said he “didn’t know.”
“I’ll certainly be looking into it,” Masters said. “I’m trying to recall even having any active Instagram account, so I don’t know.”
Many posts from the West Virginia Citizens Defense League’s Instagram account in 2023 — when Masters was serving as its president — showed @NoQuarterMasters tagged in photos alongside accounts with the same names as other officers for the organization. 
Masters, a lawyer by trade, signed off on many of the captions for those posts as Ian T. Masters, Esquire.

  Another screenshot of an Instagram post made by the West Virginia Citizens Defense League in March 2023 shows @NoQuarterMasters tagged in the photo with a caption signed by Del. Ian T. Masters.
In his statement, Pushkin said the comment made by @NoQuarterMasters — which he attributes to Masters despite his denial — was not just antisemitic but “rooted in white supremacy.”
“As a lawyer and a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, he should have known better — but clearly, he does not,” Pushkin wrote. “His bigotry is an embarrassment to his district, to our state, and to the values we are supposed to uphold as Americans.”
In addition to calling on Morrisey to call for Masters’ resignation Pushkin said House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, “should speak clearly and unequivocally in defense of decency and demand that Delegate Masters resign.”
“There is no place in our legislature for vile hate speech,” Pushkin said. “West Virginians deserve better.”
Morrisey’s office did not respond to requests for comment on this article. Hanshaw was not available for comment on Tuesday. Ann Ali, communications director for the state House of Delegates, said Hanshaw is not unfamiliar with dealing with situations where allegations have come against sitting members of the House.
“Unfortunately, this is not the first time we’ve had a report of a delegate doing or saying something completely unbecoming of the office of the West Virginia Legislature and I think in every instance [where the allegation is proven], Speaker Hanshaw has used the tools at his disposal to demonstrate his disapproval,” Ali said. 
Ali said that those powers, however, can be limited; they do include removing a sitting member from committee assignments as well as changing office assignments, seating assignments in the chamber or parking spot assignments. Other powers, Ali said, are not in the speaker’s purview since members are often elected to the Legislature by people in their respective districts. 
Masters, however, is not one of those members as he was appointed to the House seat by Morrisey in January after delegate-elect Joseph de Soto was accused of threatening to harm and kill lawmakers. De Soto had won the November 2024 election as a Republican then switched his party affiliation to Democratic shortly before being arrested for making terroristic threats. 
House Republicans in January voted to vacate the seat instead of expelling de Soto, saying it was the correct way to deal with the seat since de Soto was on house arrest and never sworn in. The vacate move prompted a legal challenge from the state Democratic Party, who argued that the seat should have gone to Democrats due to de Soto’s party switch.
The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled against state Democrats in one of their challenges over the seat. 
During the 2025 session, Masters served on the House Committee on Health and Human Resources as well as the Public Health and Health Care Regulation subcommittees. 
He was the sponsor of three bills this session: House Bill 2662, creating a felony vehicular homicide and aggravated vehicular homicide charges in the state; HB 3483, relating to mental health examination requirements and HB 3489, relating to vaccine requirements. 
None of those bills made it out of committee, however the Senate version of HB 3489 did pass and became law earlier this year with Morrisey’s signature.

“It’s maybe a five-plus-million-dollar project with no guarantee of any money coming back,” Gabe Lajeunesse, one of four partners, said.

This story by Cassandra Hemenway was first published in The Bridge on June 24.
A planned 31-lot subdivision on Isabel Circle in Montpelier that’s been in the works for nearly three years has been suspended. The “Stonewall Meadows Phase II” project, which is fully permitted with ground-breaking originally expected this year, is now on hold according to Gabe Lajeunesse, one of four partners invested in it.
“The partnership has determined that due to rising costs and the current economic uncertainty, we must suspend work on this project for now. The financial risks have become highly speculative, making it difficult to proceed in a market-based approach,” Lajeunesse wrote in an email to The Bridge, which also went out to Montpelier city officials.
“It’s maybe a five-plus-million-dollar project with no guarantee of any money coming back,” Lajeunesse told The Bridge in a June 20 interview. He pointed to a partnership with the city that fell apart as one of the reasons for pausing the project.
The four partners on the project are Lajeunesse, his brother Jason Lajeunesse, Barre City developer and mayor Thom Lauzon, and Pat Malone of Malone Properties in Montpelier.
The group bought the 72-acre wooded parcel just off of Isabel Circle for $3 million in 2024 and clear-cut a large swath of it in November of that year, preparing the site for housing lots. The four partners had planned to take advantage of a new city policy under which the city might pay for the project’s infrastructure — roads, water pipes, and sewer pipes — funded by a bond of $1.5 to $1.7 million that voters would be asked to approve. Aacred would have to guarantee that enough homes be built to pay the bond back via increased property taxes and water and sewer fees.
The plan never reached voters. In January 2025, city councilors cancelled a vote about proposing a bond for the Stonewall Meadows project after learning taxpayer investments might not be fully protected from the risk of loss.
In his June 12 email to The Bridge, Lajeunesse wrote: “We initially moved forward following early discussions with Montpelier that indicated potential financial support. However, efforts to secure a Strategic Partnership Agreement did not advance past city council to the voters. While we had hoped to continue solely through market-driven solutions, current conditions cast significant doubt on that path.”
Lajeunesse was careful to say the development is paused, not stopped. He pointed to new legislation signed by Gov. Scott, which creates a new financing tool for infrastructure that supports housing construction, but the timing and mechanism for that tool is not yet clear.
“We would love to see some public support that would make it more feasible,” he said, “… (and) we’re open to reengaging with the city and seeing if there is a strategic partnership.”
Lajeunesse ended his email with “Montpelier’s support would not only create much-needed housing but also set a precedent for future large-scale projects like the Country Club Road and Sabin’s Pasture projects.” He then thanked the city staff for their support, and said he “remain(s) open to creative solutions that could help make this project a reality.”

But as commissioners […]","Supporters of medical cannabis helped two measures reach the 2024 general election ballot, Initiatives 437 and 438. Some spoke during a public hearing at the University of Nebraska at Omaha on Oct. 25, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — It’s unclear what requirements the state commission to regulate medical cannabis in Nebraska might enact to license such operations by this fall, ahead of a deadline next week for detailing the criteria for applications.
The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission has until July 1 to write licensing criteria under state law. But as commissioners gear up for their next meeting Thursday, the first with all five commissioners, they have indicated they will consider adopting draft or emergency criteria to accept or deny licensing applications after July 1.
Licensing must begin by Oct. 1, the same time any other requirements for medical cannabis must be enacted, according to a pair of laws that voters overwhelmingly approved in a pair of November ballot measures.
However, with less than 48 hours until the next commission meeting, there is no specific indication of what criteria the board will consider.

Michael Coffey has since been appointed to a vacancy on the Liquor Control Commission. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Also on the agenda is a legal “memorandum of agreement” to help with future rulemaking involving the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and Gov. Jim Pillen’s Policy Research Office, the policy lobbying arm of the state’s chief executive.
No draft rules or regulations, including licensing criteria, have yet been made public.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, which has led medical cannabis ballot measures since 2020, said she’s faced a lack of transparency and been unable to reach the commission or have questions answered in recent weeks, leaving many advocates “extremely frustrated.”
“I didn’t know we could be more frustrated than what we have been previously, but there just seems to be a new layer added every single day,” Eggers said Tuesday.
A legal ‘memorandum of agreement’
Final regulations can’t be approved this week because state law requires 30 days of notice before a public hearing on proposed guidelines. If there are no major changes after that, and the commission approves the guidelines, the governor and Attorney General Mike Hilgers would have final say.
A copy of the proposed “memorandum of agreement” obtained by the Nebraska Examiner indicates that the commission will consider contracting with DHHS for “legal services,” such as providing research, administration and enforcement of commission duties. It could also recommend draft legislation or policies, advise on legal impacts and participate in the rulemaking process.

DHHS CEO Steve Corsi, Policy Research Director Kenny Zoeller and Dr. Monica Oldenburg, who chairs the Medical Cannabis Commission, would enter the agreement if adopted Thursday.
Oldenburg did not respond to a request for comment ahead of the meeting.
The Attorney General’s Office has already pledged to sue the Medical Cannabis Commission if and when it begins medical cannabis licensing. Office spokesperson Suzanne Gage said Tuesday that the office will provide legal support and guidance to the Medical Cannabis Commission, as it does to other agencies and commissions.
The commissioners are already being sued by a former state senator alleging that the Nebraska laws violate federal law that classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug that has a high potential for abuse and “no currently accepted medical use.”
Pillen and Corsi, as well as Eggers and other ballot sponsors, are among those named in that lawsuit. A Lancaster County District Court judge is considering whether to dismiss the case.
DHHS: ‘Cannabis is not a medication’
The ballot measure that Eggers’ organization led through November 2024 was designed to sidestep DHHS, because officials of the state health agency have “adamantly” opposed legalization over many years. That includes March, when DHHS again opposed legislation, led by Republican State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair and supported by Eggers and other longtime advocates, to help clarify the process for implementing the ballot initiatives.
Dr. Roger Donovick, executive medical officer for DHHS, said at a March legislative hearing: “DHHS maintains that cannabis is not a medication and does not agree with its legalization.”

Under the ballot measures, any health care practitioner can recommend that patients or caregivers legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis. Cannabis can’t yet be legally purchased in Nebraska, and some advocates have turned to health care providers in neighboring states for authorization.
Eggers said the legal memorandum would give “almost full authority” to DHHS to take over the rulemaking, which the campaign never intended and which voters never considered.
Instead, voters legalized medical cannabis and created the five-member Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, made up of three governor-appointed members of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission and up to two more members also appointed by the governor.
Eggers said that was because the Liquor Control Commission has had a good track record of regulation and has valued the necessity of safeguards and of providing guidance to law enforcement.
“I believe it is another direct and intentional step that they are taking to absolutely destroy patient access to medical cannabis,” Eggers said of involving DHHS.
‘Another gut punch’
A DHHS spokesperson confirmed Tuesday that the agency has neither issued any guidance related to medical cannabis nor received any complaints against physicians related to the new laws since they took effect in mid-December.
“DHHS will adhere to state statute and follow regulations and licensing processes implemented by the Nebraska Cannabis Commission,” said Jeff Powell, DHHS director of communications.

Eggers said DHHS, however, has looked at cannabis as a “farce.” She laid the blame for the confusion and lack of transparency at the feet of Hilgers and Pillen. Hilgers led opposition to the most recent legislative bill that advocates rallied behind. It fell 10 votes short last month.
“Talk about another gut punch to the people of this state,” Eggers said. “And the ultimate gut punch is to the patients that are waiting at home, that have hope that on Thursday we are one step closer to access, but what I think we see rolling out here is that the day that they receive access is getting farther and farther and farther away.”
Some lawmakers who backed the hands-off legislative recommendation from Hilgers, as well as U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., a former governor, did so partly because they first wanted to see what the Medical Cannabis Commission would do.
A separate legislative attempt to shield physicians from possible civil, criminal or professional liability from recommending medical cannabis also failed last month.
Public comment desired
Eggers said she understands patients and advocates are tired and may feel as though their voices aren’t being heard, but she said families, loved ones, neighbors and children still need Nebraskans to get loud and show up.

She said Nebraskans have a right and a duty to be part of the process. Commissioners have said they want to hear from the public, too.
“At some point, I do believe that lawmakers and state officials who are doing everything in their power to stand in the way of this and to ignore the voice of the people, to stand in the way of the will of the people, I do believe they lose at some point,” Eggers said. “But at this point, they’re winning, and Nebraskans should be absolutely disgusted … with how this is being handled.”
The Medical Cannabis Commission will meet at 10 a.m. Thursday in the first-floor hearing room of the Nebraska State Office Building in Lincoln, 301 Centennial Mall South.
Commissioners at their first meeting June 9 preliminarily approved public comment periods of up to one hour and three minutes per speaker, though a majority of the commission can change how the public participates. Written comments can be submitted to shannon.nyhoff@nebraska.gov.

DemasAction in the Michigan Legislature on Tuesday saw the House of Representatives pass long-awaited bills to curb bots for gobbling up concert and event tickets en masse, while the Senate advanced enhanced traffic penalties to protect bicyclists and others on state roads.
In the House, legislation was advanced with strong bipartisan support to ban the use of bots to purchase large quantities of event tickets. The bills were inspired by Taylor Swift fans who got burned by ticket bots during the singer-songwriter’s Eras Tour. The bills are sponsored by state Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford) and state Rep. Mike McFall (D-Hazel Park), House Bill 4262 and House Bill 4263, respectively.
Multiple hearings on the bills were serious in nature but carried a light tone, rife with nods to Swift’s music and lyrics.
That did not change as Harris and McFall celebrated the package moving to the Senate on Tuesday. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“‘Mastermind’ bot operators flip their ill-gotten tickets for massive markups, profiting at the expense of real fans – who are left ‘Haunted’ by high prices. And after the inflation Michigan families experienced in recent years, expensive tickets are part of a ‘Death by a Thousand Cuts,’” Harris said in a statement. “‘This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things.’ But we don’t have to go ‘Dancing with our Hands Tied’ here. Our bipartisan plan will protect consumers by cracking down on the shady characters who use bots to get around purchase caps and resell tickets at ‘Treacherous’ prices.’”
Together, the bills would allow the Michigan Department of Attorney General to pursue legal action against anyone using automated technology to circumvent online ticket purchasing limits. The penalties include civil fines of up to $5,000 per ticket purchased using an automated bot.
A Senate version of the package – Senate Bill 158 and Senate Bill 159 – are nearing passage in the upper chamber.
Meanwhile, the Senate on Tuesday passed a two-bill package sponsored by state Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo) and state Sen. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell), which aims to protect bicyclists, pedestrians and others on roadways.
Senate Bill 216 and Senate Bill 217 would enhance penalties against motorists convicted of moving violations that also resulted in them striking vulnerable people on roadways with their vehicles.
“Whether walking to a friend’s house, cycling out on rural roads, or crossing the street in a wheelchair – everyone deserves to use our roads to get to where they need to go safe and sound,” McCann said in a statement. “By increasing accountability for drivers to share the roads with all who navigate them, we can prevent needless tragedies from occurring and ultimately save lives.”
The changes were hailed as comprehensive but simple updates to the state’s “move over” traffic law, which requires motorists to slow down or move over into a different lane when encountering stationary vehicles with flashing, rotating or oscillating lights.
Albert in a statement said the law would be easy to follow and communicate publicly, aiding enforcement in situations that apply to every situation when a vehicle is pulled over and using its warning lights.
“This change will help make roadways safer for all – especially those in or near stationary vehicles,” Albert said.
The bills now move to the House, where the chamber is mulling its own version of the same bills from state Rep. Julie Rogers (D-Kalamazoo) and state Rep. Pauline Wendzel (R-Midland), House Bill 4334 and House Bill 4335, respectively.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1256-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 20:05:19.467533

Fields and other providers and advocates said abortion remains legal in Montana on the third anniversary of the Dobbs decision, but that doesn't mean things haven't changed. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Although abortion remains generally legal in Montana, people on the frontlines in the Treasure State said work on the ground has changed since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.
In the 2022 Dobbs opinion, the nation’s highest court overturned Roe vs. Wade, which protected the right to abortion based on medical privacy.
Since then, laws criminalizing abortion took effect in Idaho, South Dakota, Texas and elsewhere, and staff at clinics in Montana are fielding more phone calls from people out of state with questions about medical care.
“What has changed is the intense heightening of fear and confusion,” said Helen Weems, owner of All Families Healthcare in Whitefish.
The Guttmacher Institute estimated 155,000 people traveled out of state for abortion care in 2024, or 15% of all abortion patients obtaining care in states without total bans. It said the number is a decline from 2023, but still represents an increase from the pre-Dobbs baseline of 81,000 in 2020.
And providers at Blue Mountain Clinic in Missoula have seen women from other states they feared were at risk of death, even as a report released this week identified women who died preventable deaths outside Montana due to complications after abortion bans took effect.
More people in Montana also need financial support, such as gas money to get to a clinic, according to the Montana Abortion Access Program.
In recent interviews, in advance of the third anniversary of the Dobbs decision, providers and advocates in Montana reflected on the changes they have seen in the field during the course of three years.
They also argued Montanans who support reproductive freedom should remain vigilant despite protections that remain in place in the Treasure State.
“The values of Montanans, everyday Montanans, continue to be that we strongly value our privacy, and we don’t want the government interfering in any way with our ability to make medical decisions,” said Nicole Smith, with Montanans for Choice.
Three years ago, millions of people in this country lost their right to access safe and timely abortion care, said Mary Sullivan, with Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana.
“Your access to care shouldn’t depend on where you live, and that’s what we have to continue fighting for is everyone having access to essential care,” Sullivan said.

In 1999, the Montana Supreme Court opinion in Armstrong vs. State of Montana found the state Constitution protected abortion based on privacy, similar to the rationale in Roe.
Since then, the state Supreme Court has found numerous laws attempting to restrict abortion unconstitutional based on the privacy protections in the Armstrong case.
Despite those protections, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe, advocates for reproductive freedom in Montana collected signatures to place Constitutional Initiative 128 on the ballot last November, and voters approved the measure to specifically enshrine abortion protections in the state Constitution.
Earlier this month, the Montana Family Foundation announced it had sued the state of Montana over CI-128, alleging the state should have printed the entire amendment language on the ballot, and asking the amendment to be declared null and void.
The case is pending, even as the landscape for health care providers who offer abortion quietly, but significantly, shifts.
In 2024, the Montana Abortion Access Program served more clients and pledged more funding to help pay for abortions and travel than it did in its first 10 years combined, said executive director Erin Case.
The uptick started during the COVID-19 pandemic, grew after the Dobbs decision, and the need has continued to grow, she said, especially as people experience financial struggles.
“That increase has not stopped,” Case said.
Case said even though Montana is generally well served, with six clinics in the state that provide abortion care, including four operated by Planned Parenthood of Montana, access for patients in more rural areas can still be difficult.
Montana Abortion Access Program started in 2009, and it covers as little as $30 in travel support for a patient who needs to get to a clinic, she said. But in August 2024 and April 2025, the organization had record breaking demand, with 63 clients served each month.
In April, it pledged $24,549 toward the costs of abortion care and travel, the largest amount ever pledged in one month, Case said.
“The urgency for us is still there,” Case said. “There are still a lot of people accessing abortion care who need help.”
Since the Dobbs decision, women have died in the country from complications after abortion bans took effect, according to one of several reports released this week by Montanans for Choice. The report identified six documented cases whose families publicly shared stories.
It identified women in Texas and Georgia, citing reporting from The New Yorker and ProPublica. ProPublica said data is hard to come by, including because reviews are slow or even stalled.
In one case, a medical team failed to provide timely treatment for a miscarriage, and ​​the woman died of an infection in a case experts described as “horrific,” said the report from Montanans for Choice. It said one woman passing blood clots during a miscarriage bled to death in a fatality more than 12 experts found to be preventable.
Tess Fields, executive director of the Blue Mountain Clinic in Missoula, said four months ago, a young woman from Idaho called the clinic for help because of the abortion ban in Idaho.

The woman was eight weeks pregnant and scheduled an appointment a couple of weeks out to arrange for time off work and the drive of seven hours, Fields said.
Then, she called the clinic again and reported cramping, bleeding and intense pain.
The woman refused the urging of Blue Mountain staff to go to the hospital, Fields said: “This person was absolutely terrified and said, ‘I can’t do that. I can’t tell them that I am scheduled to have an abortion in Montana. What if they arrest me?’”
The woman drove seven hours straight, in pain, bleeding and alone, to the Blue Mountain Clinic, and within 15 minutes of her arrival, providers learned she was experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, Fields said.
The condition is potentially fatal, she said, and Blue Mountain transported her to a local hospital, where she received emergency surgery.
“It’s about saving lives,” Fields said. “This person was so scared … of accessing health care in her own state, that that was the situation that she was put in. And she could have died on the way here, driving alone.”
The Dobbs decision means Blue Mountain Clinic is hearing from more pregnant people who need help, and Fields said it is poised to raise $1 million this year in order to add staff, including a provider.
Fields said she’s proud of the history of the clinic, which opened nearly 50 years ago as the first in Montana and one of the first in the nation to provide abortion care. It provides the full range of family practice medicine — wellness exams, vaccines, chronic pain management, more.
“In our view, that (full range) includes abortion care,” Fields said.
She’s also proud that one of its founders, the late Judy Smith, was instrumental in the case that became Roe vs. Wade at the U.S. Supreme Court; that supporters rebuilt a reinforced clinic after an arsonist firebombed it in 1993; that some of the art on display in the new building is made of relics of the fire, such as an old phone, repurposed by clinic patients.
Sullivan, of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, said after Dobbs, opponents of abortion made “incredibly hostile attempts” to restrict it, but that isn’t the most enduring outcome she’s witnessed.
“What has changed the most is how fired up people are about their reproductive rights and just how much people do not want the government interfering in these decisions for them and their families,” Sullivan said.
She said CI-128 was one example: “The signatures turned in were a state record for any ballot issue in the state.”
She said the 2025 Montana Legislature was also the first time since the 1990s that an anti-abortion bill was defeated on the Senate floor.
Although abortion remains legal in Montana, Smith, with Montanans for Choice, said people still don’t have full reproductive freedom here.
Montanans passed CI-128, to enshrine abortion rights into the state Constitution, and it may be disputed at the Montana Supreme Court, but Smith said it only reaffirmed Roe vs. Wade.
“We all know that Roe v. Wade was never enough,” Smith said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Montana allows for care up to fetal viability, typically 23 to 25 weeks, but she said so many people need care after viability, and those people have to leave the state.
Weems, with All Families Healthcare, said medication abortion needs to be protected as well. She said more than half of all abortions in the country take place by mail, and the number in Montana, a rural state, is the same or higher.
She said since Roe was overturned, maternal and fetal deaths have increased. She sees patients from Idaho too, and she said their fear is palpable.
“They are terrified to be pregnant because being pregnant in Idaho is dangerous,” Weems said.
The Dobbs decision also has had a chilling effect on obstetrics in general, she said. Fewer people are going into obstetrics training, she said, and fewer people will be trained in abortion in the future because they are being trained in states where abortion is banned.
“It will mean fewer providers (of abortion care),” Weems said.
Despite the bulwark the 1999 Armstrong case has provided to women seeking medical care, and the resounding 58% approval of CI-128, Smith and others said people who want to ensure reproductive freedom isn’t further eroded need to remain vigilant.
In particular, Smith said, legislation to grant “fetal personhood” criminalizes women for having a miscarriage or stillbirth, has been attempted in Montana, and it could be again, despite being out of alignment with the values of Montanans, she said.
Since the Dobbs decision, she said, the atrocities women have experienced in other states could happen in Montana without fighting to protect their rights.
“We will not tolerate it,” Smith said. “We will not stand it. Abortion bans are torture, and we have a long way to go to achieve true reproductive freedom in this state and in this country, and we believe pregnant people deserve care and support, not criminalization.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4680-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 20:05:19.467533

Lawmakers on the state Senate Housing and Human Services Committee heard from housing stakeholders Tuesday about the state of Michigan’s rental landscape and legislation that aims to eliminate barriers to affordable housing.
Application fees can cost interested renters more than $100, and can be charged without any guarantee that a compatible unit will be available, eclipsing the actual cost of performing a credit and background check used to evaluate an application, Sen. Rosemary Bayer (D-Beverly Hills) told committee members.
And that’s just one of the inappropriately high fees landlords in Michigan are charging, Bayer said, outlining the changes sought under her bill, Senate Bill 372.

In addition to rental application fees being capped at $25, under Senate Bill 372, landlords would be barred from using a person’s credit score as a determining factor in denying a rental application
Landlords would have to inform tenants in writing before accepting a rental application what information will be accessed to screen the applicant’s eligibility and what findings could result in a denial of an application, under the legislation. If the landlord takes adverse action to a person’s application, the landlord would be required to give the applicant a copy of the screening report and provide an opportunity for the applicant to discuss the decision with the landlord.
Potential renters would have the opportunity to sue landlords for up to $1,000 of damages and other costs associated with bringing legal action if they violate provisions of the law.
Under Senate Bill 373, landlords would have to provide at least one rental payment option that would place an additional charge on tenants like an online payment fee or credit card convenience fee.
Unforeseen fees charged by landlords on top of rapidly increasing rents are preventing Michiganders from accessing safe and affordable housing options, Eric Hufnagel, executive director of Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness told lawmakers.
Namely, “junk fees” or hidden predatory fees are of growing concern in Michigan, Hufnagel said. “Junk fees” are often arbitrary and unpredictable, with landlords erroneously charging tenants additional fees for maintenance requests or “convenience fees” for paying rent online, even if that is the only option the landlord offers to make payments.
Senate Bill 375, also being considered by the committee, would bar landlords from charging fees that are “not reasonable” or that would add additional costs to what is already covered under a rental agreement, like a fee for garbage removal that is greater than the cost the landlord incurs for garbage removal.
“Renters deserve predictable fair housing costs that are transparent,” Hufnagel said. “As housing affordability continues to be a pressing issue in Michigan with rents rising, as of January 2025 the statewide average of rent has increased by 7.2%,… this legislation reflects a broader push to protect tenants’ rights and to promote equitable housing practices.”
Michigan was one of 21 states in 2023 where more than half of renters spent 30% or more of their income on housing, which according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development classifies them as “cost burdened” and susceptible to struggling to pay for other essentials like medical care and food.
Finding affordable housing that is safe is already hard enough without a past eviction haunting a person’s rental history, Bayer told committee members. Having an eviction or even legal record that eviction proceedings were held, regardless of outcome, can ruin a person’s ability to secure housing, she said.
The ‘scarlet ‘E’ of eviction” is a black mark on a person’s record that can prevent a person from making it through a rental screening process, regardless if the tenant committed any wrongdoing to warrant an eviction process to commence, Housing Law Attorney for the Michigan Poverty Law Program Jim Schaafsma told the committee.
Senate Bill 374 would outline a process to get excision records sealed and expunged under certain circumstances including if the person who was the subject of the eviction fulfilled the terms of the earlier judgement.
Job loss can happen to anyone, even two income households, Bayer said, and the destruction an eviction has on a person’s record is too extreme to not allow for there to be opportunities for a person to rebuild their life.
“Eviction, as we know, is one of the most traumatic things that can happen to any person or family. It can really cause them to spiral down all the way to homelessness, even when the circumstances surrounding the eviction were no fault of their own,” Bayer said.

Many potential initiatives have been tried and have failed to close the achievement gap between lower-income students and students of color with their white and more well-off peers. That makes a proven, research-backed program like debate a rare thing in education.
The post An argument for how to engage students and narrow achievement gaps: Let them debate[...]","MASSACHUSETTS HAS LONG been a leader in K-12 education, yet it has struggled to close the longstanding achievement gap between lower-income students and students of color and their white and more affluent peers. The pandemic only made things worse, as Massachusetts saw the largest widening of that gap of any state studied by researchers at the Center for Education Research Policy at Harvard and the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford. 
Effective approaches that can close persistent achievement gaps have been elusive. Yet a proven strategy to do just that exists in our backyard. What’s more, it’s one that excites and energizes young people while helping them develop skills that are crucial to success in high school and beyond. 
Debate team competition has typically been an activity more associated with students in well-off suburbs. But more than 700 students across 40 schools in Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Chelsea, Everett, and Malden participate in afterschool policy debate, where they showcase their skills at advancing an argument in competition against other teams. And there is now evidence that taking part in policy debate is not just an engaging extracurricular activity, but can help boost academic achievement among students from historically-underserved backgrounds and put them on a college-bound trajectory.   
A 2023 study, conducted by Beth Schueler from the University of Virginia and Katherine Larned from Harvard University, looked at the impact of participation in the Boston Debate League, a 20-year-old nonprofit, among Boston Public Schools students from 2008 to 2017. The researchers analyzed data from 3,515 student debaters and a control group of comparable BPS students who did not take part in debate. The study found a statistically significant correlation between student participation in BDL’s debate program and gains in English language arts achievement on MCAS as well as increases in the likelihood that students graduate from high school and enroll in post-secondary education.  
BDL debaters perform significantly better than their peers, in particular, on the set of English language arts MCAS questions that require critical thinking and analysis, gaining the equivalent of an additional two-thirds of a full year of average 9th grade learning. Ninth-grade debaters who started in the lowest performing English language arts quartile of the MCAS made the biggest gains. The study’s authors wrote that “policy debate represents a rare program with high potential to help reduce educational inequality on literacy and critical thinking skills among secondary school students.”  
The Boston Debate League, founded in 2005 and part of a network of urban debate leagues across the country, was established to make policy debate accessible to students who wouldn’t typically have opportunity to take part in such an activity: Black and brown students, students from lower-income communities, students who may speak English as a second language, and those who may be immigrants or may have an individualized educational plan. 
Through this activity, students at all levels can dive into rigorous text, work collaboratively with classmates and educators, and think critically about real world problems.  
In debate competitions, upwards of 250 young people pack into a conference-style room on a college campus or a high school cafeteria on a Friday afternoon or Saturday morning, ready to compete in a tournament. The room is buzzing as they go over last-minute notes with their coaches and teammates, perfecting their arguments for the day’s debate rounds.  
The energy is similar to that of the first big game of the season. Each tournament is the culmination of weekly afterschool debate practices where students hone their arguments, explore both the affirmative and negative sides of an argument — because they must be prepared to argue both — research their points, and find evidence to back up their claims. 
But debate isn’t limited to the podium. The same buzz of energy is present in area classrooms where educators use innovative debate-inspired practices to encourage students to build their argumentation skills and think critically.  
Through this instructional approach, students learn how to consider multiple perspectives, analyze and question evidence, consider sources and their credibility, and prepare an argument. The Boston Debate League works with nearly 250 educators each year, coaching them on how to engage about 3,000 students annually with debate-inspired practices. 
Whether it’s an English, science, history or math class, this debate-inspired approach allows students to feel empowered to express their viewpoint, backed up by evidence from the text, or to explain the reasoning behind their approach to solving a problem. This is critical thinking in action – the very skill many people say we need to do more to foster to prepare students for college and career success.  
Many potential initiatives have been tried and have failed to close the achievement gap between lower-income students and students of color with their white and more well-off peers. That makes a proven, research-backed program like debate a rare thing in education.  
The students shown by the recent study to make big strides linked to debate participation are the same ones the state is struggling to bring up to speed. Making it even more powerful is the study finding that debate participation is not just linked to a narrowing of the achievement gap but to higher rates of high school completion and post-secondary enrollment. 
Whether it is a policy debate class, an afterschool debate team, or professional development to help educators integrate debate-inspired practices into their teaching, debate-related activities shouldn’t be limited to districts that can afford the investment. They should be accessible to every student and teacher across the state.  
Debate programs like the Boston Debate League largely depend on philanthropy, while also receiving some money in fees paid by participating schools and districts and some funding through a state budget line item. The Legislature should prioritize making more funding available to less well-resourced school districts to incorporate policy debate and debate-inspired practices into their curriculum. The state should also direct funding to schools of education at public higher education institutions to incorporate debate-inspired teaching practices and training into their educator training programs for new educators. 
Scaling effective education strategies is always a challenge, but bringing debate to the much larger population of Massachusetts students and teachers who would benefit from its impact will require more public resources. 
Massachusetts recently made a big commitment of new educational funding when it launched an initiative providing free community college for all residents. Making a far more modest investment in debate programs — now backed by research showing their impact on educational outcomes among groups of students who have struggled the most — should be a winning argument.

(Provided by the Bitterroot National Forest and Inciweb)An executive order signed earlier this month by President Donald Trump would look to “consolidate” five federal wildland fire agencies into one.
The U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs and National Park Service all have departments that fight fires on their land.
Two federal departments oversee the effort — the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture. Trump directed them to consolidate their efforts within 90 days of the June 12 order. The Federal Wildland Fire Service would be under control of the U.S. Department of the Interior, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfire season is already underway across North America, with large fires burning in Canada and Alaska. Washington and Oregon have also begun to see fire seasons pick up, too. In Montana, several fires have flared, but only one has reached 2,000 acres in size this year so far.
U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, a Montana Republican, introduced legislation in February to combine wildland fire agencies in a bipartisan effort with U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat. 
“For too long, layers of senseless bureaucracy and red tape have splintered our wildfire management system, failed our brave firefighters on the ground, and let entire communities be wiped off the map by wildfire,” Sheehy said in a statement on Feb. 6. “The time is now to reshape our approach to American wildfire management and start fighting fires better, stronger, and faster.”
Sheehy, who helped found an aerial firefighting company, has been a force on legislation surrounding wildland firefighting as a freshman senator. He’s been a sponsor or cosponsor on 15 firefighting bills, including one that was recently signed by Trump that reauthorizes the sale of Department of Defense parts to repair the nation’s firefighting fleet.
Sheehy did not respond to a request for comment. However, Sheehy’s office did issue a statement thanking the president for taking action on wildfires as his repair bill was signed.
Trump’s order also cast some blame on local fire agencies, saying they “continue to disregard commonsense preventative measures.” It added that many firefighters across the country were relying on outdated equipment and were slow to respond because of “unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy.”
A fact-sheet for the order also identified how the federal government wants to modernize firefighting. It also seeks to declassify historical satellite data to help improve wildfire prediction.
“The order directs the use of available technology, including AI, data sharing, innovative mapping, and weather forecasting, to enhance state and local wildfire identification and response capabilities,” the fact-sheet said. 
According to the U.S. Forest Service, about 98% of wildfires are suppressed before they reach 100 acres. The other 2% are large and often dangerous, which Andy Stahl, the director of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, describes as acts of nature in line with a hurricane or earthquake.
Large fires weren’t ever going to be stopped, and wildland fire agencies have little room to improve, according to Stahl, who also took issue with Trump’s usage of the 2025 Los Angeles fires as the “purpose” of the order.
Those fires were driven by structures burning, adding to the intensity and scope of the inferno. A total of 16,251 homes, commercial properties, and other structures burned during those fires, according to research by UCLA.
Furthermore, Stahl noted, wildfires can’t really be fought effectively in high winds — fire breaks can quickly be jumped by embers and spot fires can turn into larger blazes. Extreme fire behavior is driven by low relative humidity, strong surface wind, unstable air, and drought, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, a government agency. None of those things can be changed by firefighters.
“The executive order is mostly political posturing for the MAGA crowd, for the firefighters, you know, and, it’s just bizarre, and it won’t change anything,” Stahl told the Daily Montanan. “Nothing in this executive order is going to move that 98% needle.”
There were 64,897 wildfires reported in 2024 according to the National Interagency Fire Center and they burned almost 9 million acres. Additionally, nearly 4,500 structures were lost to wildfires last year. In 2023, the country spent more than $3.1 billion on wildfires, which is the most recent cost estimate available.
The five-year annual average suppression cost is nearly $3 billion. As a source of comparison, the country spent more than a billion dollars on suppression just once between 1985 and 2001, though those numbers are not adjusted for inflation.
The Forest Service, which did not respond to a request for comment, covers 193 million acres of land, while the Bureau of Land Management manages 245 million acres.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Land that Sioux Falls economic development boosters had once hoped to see anchored by a $500 million slaughterhouse is now on offer as a men’s prison site.
Also a prison site option, as of Tuesday: a hundred-plus acres of ranch land just east of Box Elder, the growing city near Ellsworth Air Force Base.
Letters offering up the Pennington County ranchland and the land near what would have been Wholestone Foods in Sioux Falls were posted on Tuesday on the Project Prison Reset task force’s website. Gov. Larry Rhoden formed the group in February to study options to address the state’s swelling correctional population after lawmakers said no to the 1,500-bed, $850 million prison the governor wanted to build in southern Lincoln County.
Prison group stuck between local opposition and limited space

The task force has since rejected that Lincoln County site as an option, in spite of the state having spent about $50 million on it so far, capped the price of a new prison at $600 million, and asked Rhoden to push back the date of the planned special session of the Legislature next month at which lawmakers would be asked to sign off on a final prison plan. Rhoden agreed to the delay. 
Until Tuesday, the task force’s two remaining property options for a new prison that don’t involve land already owned by the Department of Corrections were outside of Worthing and Mitchell, respectively. Citizens and some community leaders in both cities have rallied against prison construction, however.
The task force winnowed down the options to Worthing, Mitchell and existing DOC properties in Sioux Falls and Springfield from a list of more than a dozen submissions, each sent in response to a request for information a few months ago.
The state wants at least 100 acres of land for a prison, ideally within 20 miles of its existing penitentiary workforce in Sioux Falls.
Unbuilt slaughterhouse, ranch added to options list
Tuesday’s two late-arriving options came from opposite ends of the state.
Sweetman Partners of Sioux Falls sent a letter to the task force on Tuesday to inform the group that if the state wants it, the company would be happy to negotiate a sale of 137 acres of its eastern Sioux Falls property off Interstate 229.
The land is just south of what would have been a 1,000-employee hog operation. Wholestone, part of the Iowa-based, producer-owned Pipestone Cooperative, had recently aimed to open what would have been one of the largest swine butchering operations in South Dakota in that industrial park, and the company still owns the land.


 Locations of the potential prison locations that remain in play, plus the location of the original rural Lincoln County site that’s been ruled out.
Sioux Falls voted down an effort to ban new slaughterhouses in the city on the 2022 ballot, but the project nonetheless fizzled. By mid-2023, Wholestone had partnered with an Iowa company to meet its production needs. 
Today, Sweetman Partners is in the process of selling off smaller hunks of the property just to the south of the Wholestone land. Sweetman’s managing partner said in his Tuesday letter to the Project Prison Reset task force that he’d be “willing to sell it all to the State of South Dakota.”
“If you are interested and would like to  enter into negotiations, please let me know,” Thomas Sweetman wrote.
Sweetman told South Dakota Searchlight he got a call near the end of May from someone – he couldn’t recall who – asking him if he’d sell the land to the state for a prison. He said yes, and was told to write a letter to the lieutenant governor saying as much.

Lt. Gov. Tony Venuhizen, who leads the prison task force, emailed a copy of the resulting Sweetman letter to his fellow task force members on Tuesday. He also forwarded along the pitch from the economic development coordinator for the city of Box Elder. Both letters were posted to the Project Prison Reset task force website.
The Box Elder letter touts just under 105 acres of land owned by Gikling Ranch LLC as a workable prison option. The city of Box Elder would service the site for water and utilities, the document says, and the state could take advantage of the area’s large and growing workforce. 
Box Elder has grown rapidly in recent years to meet the Air Force’s anticipated needs as it expands the base to host B-21 bombers. 
“The city offers a pro-growth climate, excellent access to training and education resources, and a collaborative approach to public-private partnerships,” the letter from Box Elder’s Sean Overeynder wrote.
Any sale of the land, he said, “is subject to appropriate due diligence and additional discussion with the City of Box Elder,” and final approval would need to come from the city council.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The Trump administration is planning to make it easier for employers to hire temporary migrant workers, U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told attendees Tuesday afternoon at the Western Governors’ Association annual meeting in Santa Fe.
Chavez-DeRemer said due to the backlog of temporary work visa applications, she is establishing “an emergency agency” within her office to process the work permits “on the spot.”
The move comes as the administration resumes immigration raids at farms, restaurants and hotels, despite having previously said those would decrease due to concerns about worker shortages.
Chavez-DeRemer said she will be working with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State and the Department of Agriculture “to understand the exact needs,” because as it stands, a work visa application must go through all three agencies.
“That’s where the hangup happened,” she said. “We’re going to do one dedicated, one-stop shop as I call it … and have a live dashboard to see exactly when those permits will be done.”
Chavez-DeRemer said she is often asked if visa applications can be done more quickly and cost less.
“Labor costs are always the highest in any business, and our farmers and ranchers know that food security is national security,” Chavez-DeRemer said.
Chavez-DeRemer told the governors the work visas for specialty occupations; temporary agricultural workers and temporary workers in industries like hospitality, landscaping or construction “are very important to a lot of your respective states and our rural communities.”
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat and the association’s outgoing chair, said the temporary work visas are critical to the agriculture sector. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said most western U.S. states have significant agriculture industries that rely on migrant workers.
“I would love for Americans to want to do those jobs,” Cox said. “None of the Americans I know want to do some of these jobs.”

Cox expressed approval of Trump’s immigration agenda so far and asked Chavez-DeRemer for more information about changes to the visa system.
“I think we’ve all agreed that we need to stop illegal immigration and fix legal immigration, and get that piece right, and this sounds like a huge step forward in fixing that second piece,” Cox said. “I appreciate that the president is fixing the first piece — and we feel much better about where we are there — but that second piece of streamlining those visas, getting workers in here and doing that could be very key.”
The Department of Labor on Friday stopped enforcing a Biden-era rule that protected union organizing activities among temporary farmworkers. Chavez-DeRemer said the rule harmed farm employers and made it harder for them to hire people.
Chavez-DeRemer said the work visa changes will “come across fairly rapidly.”
“They want a solution, and they wanted it yesterday, and now we’re finally going to lean in,” she said.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican, said the law around H2A visas, which permit people to do temporary or seasonal agricultural work, hasn’t changed since he was elected in 2018.
“There’s not been a single law passed but it’s a lot harder to get an H2A worker in 2024 than it was in 2018,” Armstrong said.
Later, Chavez-DeRemer said her department will work with Congress “on the longer-term issues of immigration reform as it needs to be addressed.”

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Several governors of Western states on Tuesday endorsed formalizing a partnership to help each other deal with the aftermath of increasingly devastating wildfires, citing the long-term effects of post-fire flooding and also uncertainty about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s future. 
Governors from New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado attended a panel discussion on the topic of post-fire flooding at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe. The governors questioned experts — including state emergency response officials and a government landslide scientist — at a discussion called “Flood After Fire – Enhancing Safety in Post-Fire Landscapes.”
The governors described the phenomenon as increasingly urgent due to wildfires burning hotter and larger across the West. High-severity wildfires can change soil composition, converting even modest rainstorms that fall on burn scars into potential floods or debris flows. 
In New Mexico, for example, post-fire flooding has impeded the recovery from the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, both for the City of Las Vegas as it tries to rebuild its water treatment facility and for smaller communities in and around the 534-square-mile burn scar. Other Western governors, including Spencer Cox of Utah, said they’re increasingly concerned about flooding after fires. That was the case when Cox came across the aftermath of a fire that burned this week.

“The first thing I thought when I drove into that community had nothing to do with the fire or the homes burned,” he said. “What I realized was, for the next five or six years, things are going to be pretty awful for those people because of the mudslides and the runoff, the sediment that comes down.”
The conversation occurred as at least six wildfires burn across New Mexico, and as burn scar areas in northern and southern New Mexico experience severe flooding or are warned to be on high-alert for it.
While no FEMA official sat on the panel, the agency’s past performance with post-fire flooding and its future loomed over the meeting. Participants mentioned the agency’s name more than 10 times, and speakers noted the challenges they’d face if the agency is dismantled, as called for briefly by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
While New Mexico’s United States Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján say the agency should still exist, they recently called on FEMA to change the way it deals with post-fire flooding. The agency has “repeatedly struggled to respond effectively” to second-order effects from wildfires, including “cascading disasters such as landslides, flooding and water system failures that compound damage and slow recovery,” the senators wrote.
NM’s U.S. senators to Noem: Reform FEMA. Don’t scrap it entirely.

Collin Haffey, a Washington post-fire recovery leader who worked for New Mexico Forestry Division during the 2022 wildfires here, spoke on the panel and said there’s a “tremendous amount of uncertainty” about the federal government’s role in wildfire recovery going forward.
“If I’m trying to build my portion of the railroad track to meet them, I don’t know how far to go,” he said. “And I think that that lack of communication down to the local level is putting lives and recovery at risk.”
So he called on the WGA to create a formal agreement between Western states, one that could help states help each other deal with the aftermath of devastating wildfires amid uncertainty about what type of aid could come from the federal government.
“We have these peer-to-peer networks because I have their cell phone numbers,” Haffey said. “But that’s not necessarily the best.”
In response, Cox, who on Tuesday was named the new WGA chair, said he would spearhead an effort to create a regional partnership. 
“Even if we weren’t, you know, seeing FEMA reform and changes happening there, we should have been doing this anyway,” he said. “And so let’s do it anyway.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9972-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 20:05:19.467533

Reversal of Clinton-era rule opens up roadbuilding and commercial logging on tens of millions of acres nationally that have been managed with a high level of environmental protection for the past quarter century.
The post Trump’s ag boss is cutting 3.3M ‘roadless’ acres from 9 national forests in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration is ending an environmental protection policy that opens up nearly 59 million acres of federal land in the United States — a Wyoming-sized expanse — to roadbuilding and timber harvest.
U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday she was rescinding the heavily litigated 2001 Roadless Rule. The pronouncement came while state executives met in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for the Western Governors’ Association conference.
“Time and again, this Clinton-era policy has proven faulty and misguided,” Rollins said in her keynote address to Gov. Mark Gordon and others. “That’s why I’m excited to announce today, here with you for the first time, our intent to repeal the disastrous roadless rule.”

The rescission was another “aggressive” move, the native Texan told the governors, to help achieve President Donald Trump’s agenda of increasing American logging. In the last six months, the administration has both initiated an executive order and a more-specific secretarial order intended to stimulate commercial federal timber harvesting — though the industry faces major headwinds that may prove insurmountable, including in parts of Wyoming.
Rollins’ repeal will directly affect the administrative status of 3.26 million acres of inventoried roadless area in Wyoming. 
Impacted forestland within the state ranges from a few small tracts of roadless area bordering Flaming Gorge Reservoir on the Ashley National Forest to 1.43 million acres of the Bridger-Teton National Forest that’s adjoining towns like Alpine, Star Valley Ranch, Jackson and Pinedale and treading far into the backcountry. 
Some 3.3 million acres of nine national forests have been classified as roadless areas for the past 24 years. (U.S. Forest Service)

Some members of those communities are eager for the change. 
The week before Rollins’ announcement, the Wyoming Legislature’s Select Federal Natural Resource Management Committee met in Pinedale and discussed roadless areas. 
“If there’s a prime target, where you can actually access some of the stuff in roadless [areas], it’s probably the Greys River,” Lincoln County Commissioner Kent Connelly told the state lawmakers. 
The lack of logging in the roadless-designated Salt River and Wyoming ranges, he said, puts Star Valley communities at risk from wildfire. 
“Alpine is totally in trouble if we catch the Greys River on fire,” Connelly said. “There’s no way to defend it. Or Star Valley Ranch. That’s all there is to it. You’re going to have to watch it burn.” 
Nearly 40% of the 3.6-million-acre Bridger-Teton National Forest has been managed as a roadless area, marked in brown in this map, for the past quarter century. The designation is going away under the second Trump administration. (U.S. Forest Service)

Nationally, nearly half of all inventoried roadless areas — some 28 million acres — are considered high or very high risk for wildfire, Rollins said. Since Clinton imposed the rule in 2001, more than 8 million acres of roadless areas have burned, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a statement supporting the rescission. 
Roadless areas in Wyoming and beyond have their benefits, especially ecologically. Even adaptable species like elk eschew roaded habitat, research has found, and wilderness-like roadless regions on the landscape can prove surprisingly rare. 
The end of the roadless rule delivers a “major blow” to the state’s values, Wyoming Wilderness Association staffer Peggie dePasquale told WyoFile in an emailed statement.
“The Roadless Rule has been a keystone in maintaining beloved wild landscapes across Wyoming for almost 25 years,” dePasquale said. “Clean water, clean air, healthy wildlife populations and opportunity to escape into pristine landscapes that aren’t crisscrossed by roads, are all characteristics that define Wyoming, and are all characteristics we stand to lose with the rescission of this long standing and critical rule.”

Hook-and-bullet advocacy groups have also come out in opposition to Rollins’ roadless rule rescission. National forests already have twice as many miles of roads as the entire U.S. National Highway System, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers lobbyist Kaden McArthur wrote in an emailed statement. 
“Repealing the Roadless Rule isn’t about improving forest management—it’s about expanding a development network that threatens intact landscapes hunters, anglers, and wildlife can’t afford to lose,” McArthur wrote.
In early June, U.S. Rep. Andrea Salinas, an Oregon Democrat, reintroduced the Roadless Area Conservation Act, legislation that sought to codify inventoried roadless areas in the National Forest System so that they could only be rescinded by an act of Congress. 
Observers had been anticipating changes to the roadless areas. 
“It’s a Forest Service rule, and the Forest Service can take a look at changing their rules,” Wyoming State Forester Kelly Norris told members of the Wyoming Legislature’s Federal Natural Resource Management Committee last week. 
Elimination of roadless areas in Wyoming will clear up some inconsistencies in the books, according to Norris. Several national forests located inside the Equality State operate under plans that predate the 2001 Roadless Rule, including the Bridger-Teton, Bighorn and Medicine Bow-Routt. As a result, their guiding land-use plans are at odds with roadless areas that were layered on top, she said.
“There are over 300 miles of roads in roadless [areas] in the Bighorn National Forest,” Norris told WyoFile. “There’s been talk of doing corrections for years.”

The settlement would give Dawn Bishop McLin her job back as a tenured professor. 
McLin’s case is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the state’s college governing board and the historically Black university. Two others have cited gender discrimination when it comes to the board’s presidential search and its selection process. 
The proposed agreement, which is still being hammered out by attorneys, would return McLin to her position as psychology professor. It would also restore the roughly $38,000 in research grants she lost after her termination, as well as $10,000 in pay for summer school courses she would have taught this semester, all totaling $48,000. 
IHL attorney Pope Mallette also requested a motion for the settlement agreement to be closed to the public, which prompted U.S. District Judge  Henry Wingate to question the move by the taxpayer-funded governing board. 
“The court does not seal public money,” Wingate said in response to Mallette’s request. 
The parties spent much of the morning in separate rooms discussing the settlement and hashing out attorney fees. 
Last year a faculty panel reviewed the university’s basis for McLin’s termination and recommended she be reinstated to her job “as a tenured faculty member fully restored,” the original court filing states. 
The exact circumstances of her termination weren’t released, but members of the faculty senate executive committee have said McLin was apparently placed on leave without any written warning and accused of harassment, malfeasance and “contumacious conduct,” a term stemming from IHL policies that means insubordination. 
Marcus Thompson, who has since resigned as Jackson State University president, did not respond to the panel’s recommendation, putting McLin in a state of limbo, ultimately forcing her to resign. 
McLin, who was elected as JSU’s faculty senate president in 2020, received support from the American Association of University Professors, a national organization that backs academic freedom, and fellow colleagues following her termination. Thompson ignored multiple letters from the professional organization.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24093257/3X0A5054.jpg,,,2025-06-24 19:07:33.878042

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)It’s halfway done.
The Maryland State Board of Education unanimously approved a memorandum of understanding Tuesday with the Blueprint Accountability and Implementation Board on their respective roles and responsibilities when it comes to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
The AIB, scheduled to meet Thursday, must also approve the memo.
The memo comes after more than three years into the implementation of the sweeping 10-year Blueprint implementation. It aims to streamline the process and eliminate constant frustration from local school systems due to the lack of clarity and final guidance by responding to both agencies.
The memo calls for the two boards to meet at least quarterly “to discuss progress, challenges, and strategies related to Blueprint implementation.” Their last joint meeting was Jan. 28. It also calls on the Blueprint board to share recommendations and evaluations with the Board of Education and for both agencies to “maintain open communication channels.”
The seven-member AIB board and its staff oversee the 10-year plan, while the state board approves any Blueprint documents submitted by the state’s 24 school systems, and other state agencies that craft elements of the Blueprint.
The Blueprint law also requires the state Department of Education to provide technical assistance and lend expertise on education policy.
State Superintendent Carey Wright acknowledged there has been “some confusion” from local school leaders, parents and other stakeholders on who was in charge and who to talk to about certain parts of the Blueprint implementation.
“I think what we’ve landed on is a good place to start,” Wright said Tuesday. “This is much clearer and more carefully defined in terms of who owns what, where the Blueprint is concerned.”

A color-coded chart highlights the roles and responsibilities based on the five Blueprint pillars, or priorities: early childhood education, high quality and diverse teachers and leaders, college and career readiness, more resources for students in need and governance and accountability.
Most of the roles are already being followed, per state law, such as the AIB taking the lead to ensure all 24 school systems offer starting teacher pay of $60,000 a year by July 1, 2026. The state board will continue to seek ways to improve educator pay.
In terms of early childhood education, the state board will continue seeking ways to expand full-day prekindergarten, assess student readiness for kindergarteners and expand pre-K services in public schools and child care providers as part of the “mixed-delivery system.”
The AIB will examine the racial, ethnic, disability-status and income makeup of full-day pre-K students and assess whether the mix of public and private prekindergarten providers “is effectively meeting the needs of families.”
The state board will lead on a few other Blueprint responsibilities, with the AIB consulting, such as establishing high school curricula, contracting with a public or private entity for a college and career readiness study and implementing a financial management and student data system.
Board member Nick Greer, who attended the meeting virtually, asked why the AIB will lead in monitoring and reviewing the performance of teacher preparation programs, rather than doing that jointly with the department. Alex Reese, chief of staff with the department, said that’s based on state law, but that “there’s nothing preventing us from picking up the phone and touching base [with the AIB] and then connecting on various pieces of the work.”
Paul Lemle, president of the Maryland State Educators Association, said he hopes having an agreement between the state board and AIB makes the Blueprint implementation run smoother.
“It’s really the goal of the Blueprint that our schools are better. So, if the process is a problem, we want to fix that,” he said in a brief interview during a break in the meeting. “We hope this kind of confusion is going to be resolved.”

Recent testing has confirmed the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furans in fish at levels that are unsafe for consumption by tribal peoples, according to a press release sent Tuesday.
“This is a precaution rooted in science and our responsibility to protect tribal health and well-being. We urge our people to stay informed and make safe choices,” said Tom McDonald, CSKT Council Vice-Chairman.
CSKT officials also advise members to avoid consuming rainbow trout and northern pike harvested from the Bitterroot River and the upper Clark Fork River above the Bitterroot River to Rock Creek, and, to avoid consuming rainbow trout from the Blackfoot River.
The press release said that PCBs, dioxins, and furans build up in fish tissue over time through water, sediment and the aquatic food web. These contaminants pose a health risk to all fish consumers, and an even greater health risk to the most sensitive members of the tribal population including women of child bearing age, pregnant nursing women, and young children. 
These contaminants have been linked to negative health effects in the immune, and nervous systems and may be associated with birth defects. Dietary exposure to PCBs is linked to development problems in children whose mothers were exposed to PCBs before becoming pregnant. PCBs and dioxins are classified as probable and definite human carcinogens, respectively. Dietary practices are the most important source of exposure to PCBs, dioxins and furans.
CSKT is aware that avoiding the consumption of fish from these waterbodies reduces opportunities for tribal members exercising off-reservation fishing rights. The tribes will continue to work to maintain the rivers and fisheries within CSKT aboriginal territory where they are healthy, and restore the rivers and fisheries where they are harmed.
This advisory is indefinite and will remain in place until further notice.

An Indiana-based gardening retailer has submitted a $9 million bid to purchase Gardener’s Supply Company, a popular employee-owned Vermont business that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday. 
Gardens Alive, Inc., is currently the sole bidder ahead of a potential auction on July 18, according to court documents. The auction will only take place if additional bidders emerge. 
Gardener’s Supply, known for its wide range of quality gardening products, disclosed in its bankruptcy filing last week that it owes more than $4.5 million to 30 creditors, including two international companies and four based in Vermont. These debts, which are not backed by collateral, have left some small suppliers questioning whether they will ever recoup the money they’re owed. 
Among them is River Berry Farm in Fairfax that sold Gardener’s Supply vegetable and herb transplants this season. Co-owner David Marchant said the bankruptcy came as a surprise — and with it, a financial blow. Gardener’s Supply owes the farm about $64,000, or about 10% of the business’s gross profit for the year, he said.
“It’s a significant hit. It’s not gonna put us out of business, but it’s gonna certainly drastically change the outcome of the year for us and our employees,” he said. 
“I know the buyer who’s bought from us real well and I wish we had gotten hints earlier,” Marchant added. “It’s too bad they didn’t let everybody know that they were in trouble.”Hannah Decker, co-owner of Fairfax Perennial Farm Inc., which has done business with Gardener’s Supply for 17 years and sells to four of its locations, is “cautiously optimistic” she will receive the $50,000 she is owed, which she estimates is almost a quarter of the farm’s yearly business.

“The timing of this really sucks …  June is for perennials,” she said. “If I don’t have their business going forward with those locations, that’s a quarter of my business right there.”Gardener’s Supply, founded in 1983, has long been considered a staple Vermont brand. Its employee-ownership model and 20-year streak winning Seven Days’ “Best garden center award” have made it a fixture in the state’s business community.
But in recent years, the company struggled to recover from what it described as the “post-COVID downturn in business,” according to a statement from a company spokesperson. Rising shipping costs, increased competition, tariffs and steep marketing costs were cited as contributing factors.
The company has “partnered with external professionals to strategically restructure its operations,” the spokesperson wrote. “… As a result, AGR [America’s Gardening Resource] has made the decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of a planned move to facilitate a transaction with a potential buyer.” 
Gardener’s Supply is being represented in the filing by Patrick J. Reilly, who previously represented Tupperware in its bankruptcy filing and subsequent sale. The bankruptcy announcement was first reported by WCAX. 
Julie Elmore, a customer who has been shopping at Gardener’s Supply since it opened, said she has valued the company’s dependability.
“They’ve really got an excellent reputation. I know people all over that love to order stuff from Gardener’s Supply cause they have good quality, they have good return policies. … I really respect companies that take care of their workers and that have employees who have ownership in it,” she said.
Morgan Brown, a manager at Gardener’s Williston location, said news of the bankruptcy was sad but that employees were sticking together.
“I would say this is the most Vermont place I’ve ever worked,” she said. “Everybody’s kind of taking [the bankruptcy] together. We’re a community business, everybody knows each other. We’re all very close, so we’re kind of just leaning on our coworkers to make everything, to keep going, we’re business as usual and we’re happy to be here,” she said.

Congress first enacted the U.S Forest Service’s “Secure Rural Schools and Self-Determination Program,” in 2000 to help fund counties comprising large swaths of public, tax-exempt forest land that previously received revenue from timber sales. The program expired in 2023, and a measure to extend the program did not pass muster in the House of Representatives late last year during budget negotiations.
But the newest bill passed unanimously by the Senate on June 18, extends the funding program through 2026.
Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, both Republicans introduced the bill along with a bipartisan group of senators mostly from western states in February.
“Many of our rural counties rely on the SRS Program to support schools, road maintenance, and more. I’m glad to see my bipartisan bill to reauthorize SRS pass the Senate, and I’ll always fight to support education programs and critical infrastructure projects in our rural communities,” Daines said in a press release.
The SRS funding formula is based on economic activity, timber harvest levels and other considerations that vary by county. The payments go toward rural schools, road maintenance and other programs that serve the counties.
In Montana, 32 counties received $16 million in 2023, according to U.S. Forest Service data.
Counties in the northwest part of the state received the most money with Lincoln County receiving $4 million, Sanders receiving $1.6 million and Flathead earning $1.2 million.

The Nebraska delegation once again emphasized that Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon, as Trump — as well the delegation — touted the U.S. strikes as a success, because Iran’s nuclear sites are “completely and fully obliterated.” The Trump administration has confirmed the existence of a classified U.S. report saying that Iran’s nuclear program was set back only a few months by the bombings and missile strikes, and called the assessment that was shared first in a CNN report “flat-out wrong.”

When asked about the leak, Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general, had a simple statement: “Iran can never get a nuclear weapon.” 
Congressional briefings on the strikes were postponed on Tuesday. National Democrats and some Republicans have questioned Trump’s authority to take military action without congressional approval. Others have questioned the success of the strikes. 
“There’s zero evidence that I’ve seen that the nuclear program was completely and totally obliterated as Donald Trump has claimed,” U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during a news conference Monday in Washington. 
Jeffries strongly opposed Trump joining the war between Iran and Israel without first securing the support of Congress. But he sidestepped questions about whether the decision was an impeachable offense or whether he would support a bipartisan resolution to limit the president’s power for additional military action against Iran.

House Speaker Mike Johnson argued Tuesday that the War Powers Act, the 1973 federal law requiring congressional authority to wage war, is unconstitutional. He said the Iran-specific proposal would fail in the House.
Bacon said that additional U.S. actions might be needed if the strikes were ineffective. 
“I don’t think [Trump] wants to do this again unless there’s evidence that these strikes were not effective,” Bacon told reporters in a Wednesday press call. “Then maybe you’ll have to reconsider.”
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb, said after the strikes that Trump ‘took the necessary steps to keep a nuclear weapon out of Iran’s reach.” Fischer also released a statement that Iran must end its nuclear enrichment program and return to the negotiating table. 
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts said the strikes “mean Iran is further from possessing a nuclear weapon.” Republican U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, who represents Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd District, said Trump “acted decisively.”

GOP U.S. Rep Mike Flood, who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st District, said the strikes  “will not only help keep America safe but can provide peace and stability around the world.” Flood later told the ABC Affiliate KETV that ‘strikes needed to happen.’
After Iran’s choreographed attack on an American-operated air base in Qatar, seen by some as an off-ramp to the current ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Earlier this month, Israel launched an attack on Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, with aerial attacks on Tehran targeting its nuclear and military infrastructure. 
While the delegation members said they hadn’t yet been briefed, they are following Trump’s lead on messaging about the conflict. The delegation had already hinted that they planned to support whatever Trump did.

Brett Guthrie of Bowling Green.
Guthrie had used his clout as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to protect a Medicaid funding stream that Kentucky hospitals say is critical to their survival.

That funding stream now is at risk in the U.S. Senate, which is proposing even steeper cuts than the House to the federal-state program that pays for 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care.
If proposals from the Senate Finance Committee become law, “you’ll have hospitals closed, services eliminated and 20,000 jobs eliminated” in Kentucky, warns Nancy Galvagni, president and CEO of the Kentucky Hospital Association. 
“We’re encouraging our senators to support the House language on state directed payments,” Galvagni said Tuesday in an interview.
While Republican senators from some states are voicing worries similar to those of Kentucky hospitals, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell had a different message for Senate Republicans in a closed meeting Tuesday, reports Punchbowl News.
“I know a lot of us are hearing from people back home about Medicaid. But they’ll get over it,” McConnell was reported as saying.
Punchbowl reports that during the closed meeting, Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, raised concerns about Senate-proposed changes to the provider tax that helps support hospitals caring for large numbers of Medicaid patients. Tillis warned that provisions in the mega-bill that Republican leaders hope to approve by July 4 could result in GOP electoral losses similar to those suffered by Democrats after passage of Obamacare.
A spokesperson for McConnell, the former Senate Republican leader, told the Lantern: “Senator McConnell was speaking about the people who are abusing Medicaid — the able-bodied Americans who should be working — and the need to withstand Democrats’ scare tactics when it comes to Medicaid. Senator McConnell was urging his fellow members to highlight that message to our constituents and remind them that we should all be against waste, fraud, and abuse while working to protect our rural hospitals and have safety nets in place for people that need it.”
Sen. Rand Paul’s office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
35 Kentucky hospitals considered at risk of closing
At issue is a tax that Kentucky and other states collect from health care providers and use to supplement Medicaid payments. The goal is to boost what hospitals are paid for treating low-income Medicaid patients closer to what commercial insurers would pay for the same services.

These state-directed payments pumped $4.5 billion into Kentucky hospitals in fiscal year 2024 and are expected to reach $5.5 billion by 2026. That’s a quarter of the entire Kentucky Medicaid budget.
Even with that supplemental support, many Kentucky hospitals are operating on perilously thin margins and, without it, they would lose money, Galvagni told the Lantern Tuesday. 
The hospital association commissioned a study that found Kentucky hospitals on average are operating on a 2% margin that would drop into negative numbers —  negative 7.4% — if what’s proposed in the Senate is approved, she said.
Researchers at the University of North Carolina recently analyzed hospitals’ operating margins and their dependence on Medicaid payments and identified 338 hospitals that would be most at risk of shutting down as a result of the Medicaid cuts Congress is considering.
Thirty-five of the hospitals identified as most at risk of closing are in Kentucky — more than any other state.
The House plan protects the status quo in Kentucky by freezing state provider taxes at current levels and grandfathering in existing plans for supplementing Medicaid reimbursements through state directed payments. Kentucky has three state directed payments plans — one for the state’s two teaching hospitals at the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville, one for all the other hospitals and a small plan for ambulance services.
The Kentucky plans, approved by the first Trump administration in 2020, tie supplemental funding for hospitals to quality measures  intended to improve care. Galvagni said the financial incentives are driving improvements including reductions in infection rates, readmissions and opioid prescribing.
Gaming the system?
But the current Trump administration accuses its predecessors in the Biden administration of allowing states and health care providers to “game the system” via provider taxes to tap additional federal funds to boost Medicaid payments.
Medicaid covers people who have low incomes or disabilities including working people who can’t afford or don’t have access to employer-provided health insurance. It is funded jointly by states and the federal government with most of the money coming from Washington. 
Dr. Mehmet Oz, Trump’s Medicare and Medicaid administrator, described provider taxes and state directed payments as “legalized money laundering” in a recent Capitol briefing, reports The Hill. 
A June 6 White House memorandum says: “These State Directed Payments have rapidly accelerated, quadrupling in magnitude over the last 4 years and reaching $110 billion in 2024 alone,” threatening “the Federal Treasury and Medicaid’s long-term stability.”
The memo orders Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid, including by ensuring Medicaid payments rates are not higher than Medicare, to the extent permitted by applicable law.” 
The Senate proposal would reduce Medicaid’s state directed payments to hospitals by 10% each year until they reach the allowable Medicare-related payment limit.
Both Medicaid and Medicare rates are low in Kentucky
Galvagni said pegging the Medicaid supplement to Medicare rates would be “extremely damaging to Kentucky” and put many Kentucky hospitals into an even more unsustainable financial position because Medicare rates in Kentucky are almost as low as Medicaid rates. “You can’t pay the hospitals less than what it costs to deliver services,” Galvagni said, and not expect some to close and others to reduce services.
Medicare is a federally funded program that mainly covers people age 65 and over.
Galvagni also disputed suggestions that Kentucky is abusing the provider tax. All hospitals pay the same rate, she said, and the amount of tax they pay is not related to the amount of money they receive from Medicaid.
In the Senate, Republicans Jim Justice of West Virginia and Josh Hawley of Missouri have publicly voiced surprise and alarm at the cuts to provider taxes and Medicaid payments proposed by the Finance Committee.
Provisions in the House bill would cause an estimated 277,000 Kentuckians to lose their Medicaid coverage, according to KFF, which says that number could go as high as 346,000. 
Republicans in Congress also are expected to let tax credits expire that help Americans afford health insurance in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Without the tax credits the number of uninsured Kentuckians is projected to rise by 21%, according to The Urban Institute.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Attorney General Marty Jackley announced a flurry of criminal charges Tuesday in a series of incidents that have played out since February on the grounds of the South Dakota State Penitentiary.
Two people stand accused of providing the drugs that killed two of the four inmates who’ve overdosed this year in South Dakota prisons.
The charges in the overdose deaths of 20-year-old Anthony Richards and 39-year-old Jason Garreau were unsealed Tuesday. 
Legislative group studies SD’s high incarceration rate, overrepresentation of Indigenous prisoners

An inmate allegedly supplied the synthetic marijuana that killed Richards in February at the penitentiary’s Jameson Annex. The methamphetamine and cocaine that killed Garreau in the penitentiary in May was allegedly delivered hand-to-hand by an on-site visitor who lives in Sioux Falls.
There are two other suspected prison overdose deaths under investigation, Attorney General Marty Jackley said Tuesday at the Law Enforcement Center in Sioux Falls. 
Charges may come soon in those cases, which involved the May 18 death of 24-year-old Joshua Arrow and the June 10 death of 42-year-old Nicholas Skorka.
Jackley said the state’s still awaiting toxicology results in those cases. 
Fighting: Nine gangs involved 
Also unsealed Tuesday were felony assault and rioting indictments for 24 inmates reportedly involved in a 40-man gang skirmish at the Jameson Annex on May 27 that injured 14 and sent four to the hospital. 
There were nine gangs involved in that fight, Jackley said. The violence was “coordinated” by the gangs, he said, but he declined to say if any of the eight inmate victims who are named in the indictments were targeted specifically.
Two of the people whose names are listed as assault victims were themselves charged for felony rioting, defined under South Dakota law as an incident in which three or more people break things or hurt others on purpose. 
“I’m going to suggest to you that of the 24 indicted, they might all be taking the position that they’re victims,” Jackley said, noting that the Division of Criminal Investigation concluded that only eight of those involved could legally be classified as such.
The number of gangs involved – nine – is “probably more than I’m normally involved with in a particular investigation,” Jackley said. But he also said he recognizes that “there is gang prevalence at the penitentiary.”
Fallout: visits suspended, investigations ongoing 
The charges relate to some, but not all, of the recent high-profile prison grounds incidents. 
An inmate broke the nose of a female correctional officer in late March at the penitentiary.
Another, unrelated bout of violence at the Jameson Annex between inmates came hours later. On May 7, a male correctional officer was injured by an inmate at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield. 
None of those incidents has drawn charges. 
Fight breaks out at penitentiary one month after similar violence that injured officer

Several investigations have commenced this year into situations like those, Jackley said, as well as into a prison drug ring the Department of Corrections announced it had broken up.
A late May press release on that investigation said criminal charges would follow “if warranted.”
The attorney general declined to say Tuesday if more charges were imminent in any of those situations.
“Like all investigations, you may reach a point where you’re prepared because there’s probable cause and a reasonable likelihood that a jury would convict, where you move forward, but those investigations are not at that charging decision stage,” Jackley said.
He did suggest that autopsy results in the overdose deaths of Arrow and Skorka would be necessary to make the call in those specific cases. After Tuesday’s press conference, Jackley spokesman Tony Mangan told South Dakota Searchlight that the state is waiting for final reports in the officer assault cases. 
The Department of Corrections, meanwhile, suspended in-person visits in Sioux Falls in response to the drug ring investigation.
That decision has led to some consternation among inmate families, some of whom planned to hold the latest in a series of protests against the DOC Tuesday evening.
The charges and investigations this year have taken place as state officials consider sites for a new men’s prison to replace the oldest parts of the penitentiary. 
The first meeting of the Project Prison Reset task force came days after the late March assaults. Penitentiary and Jameson Annex inmates were on a security lockdown when the task force members toured the grounds for that April 2 meeting.
The officer in Durfee was attacked a week and a day after the group met in Springfield.
The next task force meeting is scheduled for July 8 in Sioux Falls.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a 16-state coalition filing an amicus brief Tuesday supporting the Trump administration’s efforts to cut some funding for Harvard University over reported claims of antisemitism on campus.
Bird, alongside 15 other attorneys general, filed the brief Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by Harvard University challenging the move to strip billions in federal funding from the institution. In April, President Donald Trump’s administration paused $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $50 million in multi-year contracts for Harvard.
While the funding cut follows reports of instances of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment on campus, the decision came after the administration demanded Harvard end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, cooperate with immigration authorities and adopt merit-based admission standards or risk losing $9 billion in research funding — demands rejected by the university.
The federal lawsuit claims the federal government’s decision to slash funding for the university is being used as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard,” and argues the research funding being impacted by the cuts is unrelated to concerns about antisemitism. Attorneys for the university have also stated the funding cut is a violation of the First Amendment, as the government’s demands include potential restrictions on material that can be taught by Harvard faculty.
But in the amicus brief filed Tuesday, Bird and the other attorneys general said the claim that the Trump administration is violating the First Amendment is invalid. The filing points to a previous federal decision to strip tax-exempt status from Bob Jones University, affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983, because the institution was in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws by excluding Black applicants as students unless they were married.
The brief cites the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Bias report filed in April by Harvard University as evidence that there were repeated instances of antisemitism and an “alienating and hostile atmosphere” experienced by Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas against Israel.
“Harvard has failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students on its campus since at least October 7, 2023,” the brief states. “… Harvard invokes the First Amendment to distract from its failure to protect Jewish students in violation of Title IV, which the federal government cited as its reason for freezing funding. But the bottom line is that the First Amendment does not allow institutions to violate Title VI. Universities that accept federal funding must live up to their obligations to protect Jewish students, just like they protect students of other nationalities, ethnicities, and religions.”
Bird was joined in the brief by the attorneys general for Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.
In a news release, Bird said she and the other state officials “stand firmly with the Trump Administration and against antisemitism,” adding, “but Harvard does not.”
“When President Trump acted to fix the rampant antisemitism on Harvard’s campus by restricting federal funding, Harvard sued,” Bird said in a statement. “Harvard itself admits that antisemitism both exists and is a problem on its campus but is unwilling to address the issue. Jewish students deserve equal protection and access to education which is why I led a 16-state coalition to support President Trump’s actions.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/birdnewsconf5.31-scaled-e1717192095129-1024x729.jpg,,,2025-06-24 19:07:33.878042

Jim Pillen announced that he had picked the Columbus, Nebraska, native to be next director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After serving just two years as the state’s top economic developer, K.C. Belitz is exiting as director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.
Gov. Jim Pillen announced the resignation late Tuesday, without detailing why. Belitz did not return a reporter’s phone call. His final day with the state is July 18.
Belitz has overseen the review and award of hundreds of millions of dollars in grants through state and local programs aimed at revitalizing key areas of Nebraska, including the often tumultuous North and South Omaha recovery grant program, as well as for smaller rural communities.
Formerly a longtime head of the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce, Belitz, 56, has often said his focus was on how to attract people as much as businesses to his home state that struggled to fill open jobs.
“K.C. is a committed public servant, whose entire career has been about growing local communities and growing Nebraska,” said Pillen, whose hometown also is Columbus. “Over the past two years, he has been a positive champion for bringing new business to the state and fostering relationships that will allow Nebraska to continue attracting companies involved in the bioeconomy, manufacturing, technology and other industries. I appreciate all that K.C. has done as director of DED and wish him the very best in all future endeavors.”
Belitz, in a statement, said it was a pleasure to serve Pillen and Nebraskans as DED director. He replaced Tony Goins, who resigned from his $215,000-a-year-job amid questions about potential conflicts of interest.
Of his DED post, Belitz described it as “immensely satisfying.”
“It has afforded me the chance to meet stakeholders across Nebraska who care deeply about their communities, making investments and creating opportunities so that families can raise their kids, have great careers, and thrive in their home state,” he said. 
The Pillen statement said an announcement on an interim DED leader is to be made later.

The governor of Rhode Island, a handful of state scientists, and a flock of reporters walked into an unfinished building in Providence Tuesday.
Donning hard hats, fluorescent vests, and safety glasses, and corralled by construction workers, the group congregated in the 90-degrees heat to tour Rhode Island’s new public health laboratory — an approximately $98 million project three years in the making, and one that state officials say is finally nearing completion.
Gov. Dan McKee invited the press to see the somewhat furnished, but not finished, space that will be home to the Rhode Island State Health Laboratories, which is part of the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH). 
It’s likely the 80,000-square foot lab space will be finished before the end of summer. About 100 people are expected to use the lab space to monitor a range of nearly invisible threats, from infectious germs to milkborne pathogens to seawater pollutants. 
Currently, the health lab is housed in a nondescript administrative building on Orms Street, near the State House. Dr. Louis Marchetti, who leads the state’s Center for Clinical Toxicology and Laboratory Support, joked with reporters that the current facility is “one microwave away from a blackout.”
Still, Marchetti said: “People are really unaware of the technologies that exist within the state lab. While our current building might be old, our instrumentation is not.”
The new health lab is about 20% to 30% bigger than the current space and will have areas for the public to drop off samples for testing, and improved access controls for staff as well as law enforcement who come in to work on forensic samples. 
An organic chemistry lab will provide space to analyze PFAS, or the plastics known as forever chemicals. Microbiology space will give insight into the safety of beach water or the health of shellfish beds. Rabies, mosquitoes and meningitis are all within the laboratories’ purview. 
The building will also be home to Rhode Island’s only Biosafety Level 3 lab — the highest level of containment afforded only the most dangerous pathogens — although officials stressed that the state will only test local samples, and won’t import hazardous materials. The labs, Marchetti stressed, are not so much about research as they are public health. 
State surveillance of infectious diseases has pushed itself to the front of officials’ minds in the post-COVID-19 era. Dr. Glen Gallagher, the director of the State Health Laboratories and the tour’s leader, said the pandemic taught state health officials the importance of being able to pivot. That’s why the new facility includes a flex lab that can accommodate surge testing.

There’s also space for wastewater surveillance, another trend in epidemiology that became something of a household term during the COVID era. Currently, wastewater testing is “squished” alongside other lab activities, said Dr. Richard Huard, who leads RIDOH’s Center for Biological Science Laboratories.
“Everybody goes to the bathroom and takes a shower,” Huard said. “Think of everything that goes into wastewater, from your laundry machine, your shower, your sinks.”
Yet the state’s wastewater-testing tech is so sensitive, Huard said, that it can detect “a little bit of a viral DNA” even in massive volumes of wastewater. This sewer runoff helps state scientists track outbreaks of pathogens like COVID-19 and flu. It also lets the health department warn local hospitals that a new wave or this or that virus may be emerging in the state. 
But Huard noted that one category dominates the lab’s day-to-day operations: sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A recent state report found that STIs seem to have returned from their period of hibernation during the pandemic — a time when people were having less sex, and with fewer people, according to public health researchers.
Huard said part of the state’s goal is to return testing results quickly enough to interrupt the spread of these infections, namely chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV and syphilis, which are the tests most commonly processed by the state laboratories.
“They’re important tests, because once a patient gets a diagnosis and is put on treatment, that’s how you break the chain of transmission,” Huard said.
Prominently planted at the edge of the Jewelry District, a few minutes’ walk from many of the city’s nightclubs and theaters, the building itself is jewellike, encased in terracotta cladding and adorned with slender windows with “playful spacing,” in the words of one design planning document. 
Behind the facade, the interior looks modern and airy, with the sterile white of lab spaces emphasized by the light coming in from the elongated windows — something Gallagher appreciated, along with the accompanying city views.
“You can see the space is really open. There’s a lot of windows. So this is really a real improvement,” Gallagher said in the area that will eventually become the STI testing room. 
The project was primarily funded by a grant worth $82 million from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Asked by reporters if Gallagher thought the construction funding was endangered under President Donald Trump’s administration, Gallagher said the grant money was secure and has largely been spent.
And it was likely money well spent, as suggested by Gallagher’s answer when asked why Rhode Islanders should care about the building.
“The work that happens here really touches every component of their lives, whether they know it or not,” he told reporters.

“It is very unclear what the world after federal funding looks like for public media,” Vermont Public CEO Vijay Singh said this week.

Vermont’s joint NPR and PBS station, Vermont Public, stands to lose about 10% of its annual funding if Congress signs off on President Donald Trump’s request to claw back funding the federal government provides for public media stations across the country. The measure passed the House earlier this month, and is now being considered in the Senate, where a hearing on the proposal is scheduled for Wednesday morning. 
For Vermont Public, the potential funding cut — which would set the station back about $2 million a year — is unlikely to pose an existential threat, according to CEO Vijay Singh. The station relies less heavily on federal funding, he said, than many others around the country do. He added that Vermont Public’s leadership has done some initial “contingency planning,” though declined to specify, noting much was still up in the air.
Congress has until July 18 to make a decision on the president’s request.
Trump and his Republican allies in Congress backing the funding cut have framed it as an effort to divorce taxpayer money from news outlets they claim are biased. That criticism has led Singh and other public media leaders to make urgent appeals about the nature of their work in recent months — and landed the news stations in their own headlines. 
Meanwhile, Singh said the proposed cuts have created significant uncertainty over whether public media in the U.S., which today operates as a closely-linked network of local stations sharing content and broadcast infrastructure, can continue in that form. 
“It is very unclear what the world, after federal funding, looks like for public media,” he said in an interview Monday afternoon at Vermont Public’s studios in Colchester. 
Like other public media stations, Vermont Public funds its programming in part with money appropriated by Congress to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a nonprofit run independently from the federal government, which then distributes the money to individual outlets — as well as to NPR and PBS at the national level.

At the beginning of June, Trump asked lawmakers to claw back about $1 billion in funding they have already appropriated to support public media stations across the country over the next two years. Through that process, formally known as a “recission” request, the White House also asked lawmakers to pull back more than $8 billion for foreign aid programs that address global public health and hunger relief.
Conservative activists have been pushing to eliminate federal funding for public media stations for decades. Previous Republican presidents, including Trump, during his first term, have tried to do so, though so far, none have convinced Congress to go along.
This year’s measure passed narrowly through the House, largely along party lines, with most — though not all — Republicans in support. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement earlier this year that NPR and PBS have “consistently and knowingly betrayed the public trust” and “routinely ignore facts to advance a far left agenda.” 
Singh acknowledged “a lot of people have that preconceived notion” that public media, especially at the national level, has a liberal bias. Vermont Public airs many nationally-syndicated NPR and PBS programs, though it also produces its own programs that focus on news and culture in Vermont and neighboring regions.
He said that notion largely stems from the stations’ charge to represent viewpoints that do not always make it into traditional, commercial media stories — meaning the stations’ content will, by design, avoid promoting any one set of views.
“We are not here to reinforce worldviews, and realistically, that’s how a lot of commercial media operates,” Singh said. Public media, he contended, is “going to challenge your worldview. And that is, I think, sometimes where the feedback that we get comes from.”
Vermont Public leans less on federal funding than many other public media stations around the country, particularly among rural states, Singh said. According to data from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, almost half of all rural stations rely on the feds for at least 25% of their revenue, while about 35 stations — many of them on Native American reservations — rely on the government for at least half of their revenue. 
Just shy of 60% of Vermont Public’s revenue comes from individual donations and business sponsorships, according to the station’s latest annual report. In addition to that revenue and federal support, the report states, the station funds about 25% of its yearly operational costs with income from a substantial investment fund. 
Much of that fund comes from the 2017 sale of a Vermont PBS broadcast license to the federal government, which totaled about $55 million. The public television station merged with Vermont Public Radio in 2021 under the combined name Vermont Public. 
According to Singh, the investment fund provides a “cushion” that keeps Vermont Public from operating at a deficit, so the station’s leaders would be hesitant to dip into the fund further to support its operations in the event the station loses its federal funding. 
Rather than turn to its investments, he said the station would likely launch a public fundraising campaign to make up the $2 million gap, if needed. 
Singh said Vermont Public has been in regular contact with the state’s congressional delegation about the impacts of a potential funding cut. One of Vermont’s U.S. senators, Democrat Peter Welch, spoke against the rescission proposal on the Senate floor earlier this month, pointing to how, among other roles, public radio stations can be the only source of information available during a natural disaster.
Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark, also a Democrat, has signed onto a memo filed in support of two federal lawsuits challenging the proposed public media cuts. The amicus brief argues funding losses could curtail the spread of emergency information across the country, among other points. The suits were brought by NPR and PBS, as well as local stations in Colorado and Minnesota. 
Public media stations provide “a source of local news at a time when we have news deserts all around the country, and the pressure on our local newspapers, on our local broadcasters, on our local radio stations is enormous,” Welch said on the Senate floor. “We need public broadcasting.”

A bill that would require tech companies to compensate Oregon newsrooms like these failed to pass the Oregon Senate on Tuesday. (Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A novel proposal that would mandate tech companies to pay local journalism outlets for using their news content failed to gain steam in its first floor vote in the Oregon Senate on Tuesday, effectively killing its chance to pass this year.
Lawmakers on Tuesday voted 15-14 against Senate Bill 686, introduced in January, which aims to regulate tech companies and social media platforms like Google and Meta that aggregate, publish and use news content for their feeds or algorithms to provide information to users. Four Democrats were in opposition.
“Does anybody honestly believe these companies are going to just write the check and keep doing business as usual here?” Sen. Mark Meek, D-Gladstone, asked his colleagues Tuesday before voting against the legislation. “No, they will stop sharing news content in Oregon all together, just like they did in Canada.”
The effort at enacting the nation’s most stringent rules regulating journalism content and reproduction has also met a mounting resistance from tech companies. Meta, for instance, has threatened to remove Oregon news from their platforms altogether if the bill passes, echoing its position in Canada where a similar law was passed in 2023.
The vote against the bill was followed by a motion by Sen. Kayse Jama, D-Portland, to send the bill back to the Senate Committee on Rules, where it was previously amended on June 11 in the face of legal concerns over regulation of private markets and the First Amendment.
But it’s unlikely that the bill will be revived, amended and passed out of committee and both chambers by Sunday, when Oregon’s legislative session ends. And the bill’s author, Sen. Khanh Phạm, D-Portland, told the Capital Chronicle that she will be reintroducing the bill next session.
The original version of the legislation had three avenues for platforms to satisfy the legislation’s regulations: pay each accessed provider an unspecified amount, enter into an arbitration process, or donate to a university-backed public media board. The new bill preserves those pathways but heightens the protections news outlets have if their content is used without an agreement with an online platform.
Under the legislation, companies like Apple, Google and Meta could pay tens of millions of dollars into a state fund that would support news outlets throughout the state, based on their size and the number of journalists they employ. Firms like Google, Instagram and Facebook could pay into a central fund that is doled out to different newsrooms based on size, paying $104 million annually if they have six billion or more monthly active users worldwide, or $18 million annually if they have fewer than six billion worldwide users.
One-tenth of that money would go to the Oregon Civic Information Consortium, a proposed board under the purview of the University of Oregon that would help train future journalists, offer grants to newsrooms and ensure funding for news deserts such as rural communities. The rest of the funding would go to newsrooms based on the number of employees and journalists they have; 70% of the funds must be spent on journalists and support staff by providers.
“We trust the people who work in this industry and whose vocation depends on freedom of the press to guide us on what they need,” Phạm said on the Senate floor, referencing the more than 50 Oregon newsrooms that have voiced support for the bill.  “Now they need a fighting chance in an unfair market.”
The bill was amended in a June committee hearing, however, to address legal concerns about violating the First Amendment and regulating the free market, though lawmakers anticipate the untested measure would face a legal challenge anyway. The new version shifted the focus away from cracking down on social media and tech platforms, aiming instead to empower news outlets to create agreements with platforms for payment or face legal consequences.
Sen. Daniel Bonham, R-The Dalles, warned his colleagues that the bill could unintentionally incentivize platforms to establish agreements with politically-biased media. He was also unsure if the bill would survive under legal scrutiny.
Under the new version of the legislation, online platforms could face lawsuits for damages from newsrooms if the companies accessed their content without a written agreement. The proposal would establish an arbitration process to decide what proportion of ad revenue a platform should dole out to newsrooms. The reworked bill also classifies the access and use of such content through aggregation, publishing and distribution without a formal agreement with an outlet as an unfair trade practice.
Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Ashland, told his colleagues there was no avoiding the uncertainty the bill would pose in the courts. But, he asked, “Can you think of a significant law in the past that tries to solve a significant problem that hasn’t been litigated?”
Aside from Meek, the three other Democrats who voted in opposition to the bill were Sens. Kayse Jama, D-Portland, Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene and Janeen Sollman, D-Hillsboro.  Jama reversed his position in order to be part of the prevailing majority against the bill, allowing him to call for the bill to be reconsidered and sent to committee. The one Republican who had expressed support for the legislation, Sen. Dick Anderson, R-Lincoln City, also voted against the bill.

,California,2025-06-24 22:21:06+00:00,CalMatters,Trump cancelled millions in California research grants. Judges want to restore them,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/06/health-research-california/,"The science grants are a core aspect of university operations and science development in the U.S. At the University of California alone, National Institutes of Health funding brought in $2.6 billion last year.","In summary
The science grants are a core aspect of university operations and science development in the U.S. At the University of California alone, National Institutes of Health funding brought in $2.6 billion last year. 


Federal judges handed California researchers temporary victories in their quest to retrieve what’s likely tens of millions of dollars in federal grants the Trump administration cancelled this year.
The judges issued the rulings in three cases Monday. In one case, more than 800 science research grants, including about 430 in California, need to be restored after a federal Massachusetts judge ruled the Trump administration’s cancellation of the grants was “illegal” as well as “arbitrary and capricious.” The list could grow as the trial advances. The judge said last week that he had “never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable” in his 40 years on the bench. A similar case filed by a national coalition of health researchers and graduate students affects a few dozen California research grants and hundreds of others across the country. Both cases were heard by William Young, a President Ronald Reagan appointee, and largely concern the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research.
In his statement last week, Young was referring to the legion of cancelled grants that investigated racial health disparities and funded health research into women and the LGBTQ+ community. The cancelled grants have also included research into dementia, aging, vaccines and a wide constellation of health science discovery. Congress had already allocated the funds to the National Institutes of Health and these grants were approved by committees of scientists in a highly competitive process.
The agency began cancelling the grants after President Donald Trump issued several executive orders seeking to cut federal support for programs that relate to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. A key focus for the health science agency was expanding the pool of diverse scholars and research concerning women and minorities. Those priorities were established by Congress.
The cancelled grants affect not just established research scientists. The cuts include programs for graduate students whose income and education are dependent on research grants to support their work and for promising undergraduate students who receive financial stipends to work in labs and hone their research skills to eventually apply for doctoral programs. The science grants are a core aspect of university operations and science development in the U.S. At the University of California, National Institutes of Health funding brought in $2.6 billion last year. Cancelled grants also ended training programs for students at California State University.Several cancelled grants have already been restored since states sued the federal government, including a large study at UC Davis investigating the causes of dementia.
When money will be returned is unknown
“It is our expectation and we believe the court’s expectation that funding will be restored,” said Joanne Adams, a spokesperson for California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who was among 16 state attorneys general to sue the Trump administration over the terminated grants.
Within hours of the ruling, lawyers for the Trump administration requested that the judge put a pause on his order for 14 days. They also filed an appeal with the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. Young rejected the pause request this morning.This is a case “concerning health research already bought and paid for by the Congress of the United States through funds appropriated for expenditure and properly allocated during this fiscal year,” Young wrote in his rejection of the pause. “Even a day’s delay further destroys the unmistakable legislative purpose from its accomplishment.”“We appreciate the court’s ruling,” said Stett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the University of California. “The longstanding partnership between the NIH and the University of California has allowed UC to develop breakthroughs that get us closer to curing cancer, and new technologies that can detect and combat life-threatening illnesses like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s faster than ever before.“When researchers will receive their funding again is unclear. “My best guess is it will be after all stays and appeals are resolved,” said Shalini Goel Agarwal, according to Axios. He’s special counsel at Protect Democracy and an attorney for the researchers and groups who sued the federal government.Extended funding delays may damage some research projects, professors wrote to the court. “Once cancelled, most research projects cannot immediately resume. Many of these projects entail longitudinal studies,” wrote a senior research official at UC San Francisco, Harold R. Collard. “When scientific studies stop in full swing, their partial results often lose validity.”
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for Health and Human Services, the department that includes the National Institutes of Health, said the department “stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people,” according to Axios.
UC researchers may get science, environmental grants back
And in a third case, a federal district court judge in California ordered the federal government to “reinstate” numerous University of California grants that were cancelled by three agencies: The National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Endowment for the Humanities.Six UC scholars filed the suit this month after their respective grants were “terminated without explanation,” as the judge on the case, Rita F. Lin, put it.One of the plaintiffs, Dr. Neeta Thakur, “studies how genes in different racial and ethnic groups affect lung disease” and was awarded a federal grant to study the health risks caused by wildfire smoke “in communities of color and low income communities,” the judge said.In a preliminary injunction, Lin ordered that the grants from those three agencies be restored if they were cancelled with a termination form that used vague or generic language about the project not meeting agency priorities or for running afoul of Trump’s bans on DEI funding.Trump administration officials “have admitted that grants were flagged for termination for researching blacklisted topics, based on keyword searches or titles,” Lin wrote.Lin scheduled a meeting July 2 so that Trump administration lawyers can tell her what they have done to comply with the court order. Trump administration lawyers could seek an appeal with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to try to halt Lin’s preliminary injunction.The cases in Massachusetts and California are “nicely complementary, and we have decisions in plaintiffs’ favor in both cases at just about the same time,” said Claudia Polsky, a lawyer for the six UC scholars. She’s also a law professor at UC Berkeley, but isn’t representing the university in this case.Polsky said that cancelled grants from other agencies could also be reinstated as the trial progresses. She’s unsure how many grants would ultimately be restored by Lin’s order Monday, but it likely affects millions of dollars in research.And in another development, California and 21 other states led by Democrats filed a lawsuit today targeting a main tool that the Trump administration has used to terminate about $10 billion in grants across federal agencies. Federal regulations say an agency can cancel an award if it “no longer effectuates . . . agency priorities” — the language the Trump administration is using in its grant termination letters. 
But today’s suit argues that the federal agency behind those regulations wrote in 2020 that federal agencies “are not able to terminate grants arbitrarily.” Lawyers for the states want the judge to halt the Trump administration’s use of that regulatory clause in terminating grants.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050625_CSU-San-Marcos_AH_CM_47.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-24 19:07:33.878042

Compassion Center, withdrew earlier in the year. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The state’s Cannabis Control Commission is looking to license a new compassion center in northern Rhode Island after plans for one in Woonsocket were scrapped.
The three-member commission have reopened applications for candidates who qualified to open the medical marijuana dispensaries in the original 2021 license application process, with submissions due Sept. 18. The license is reserved for a business that opens in Zone 1, which includes Burrillville, Cumberland, Glocester, North Smithfield and Woonsocket. Smithfield is excluded, as voters in 2022 narrowly rejected allowing retail cannabis shops in town.
R.M.I. Compassion Center Inc. won the Zone 1 license in the fall 2021 lottery, with plans to open at Walnut Hill Plaza in Woonsocket by last summer, according to its website. R.M.I quickly faced pushback from local zoning officials, resulting in a court battle that R.M.I ultimately won.
But the center never opened and R.M.I. withdrew its application in January after failing to meet the state’s licensing requirements in September 2024, according to a consent order from the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation.
Paul Isikwe, who is listed on state documents as the president of the business, did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Four other applicants qualified for the 2021 lottery: Livity Compassion Center, Medici Compassionate Care Center Inc., New Leaf Compassion Center Inc., and Pinnacle Compassion Center Inc. To receive the license now, they must meet new regulatory requirements, including proof of zoning approval, operational readiness, and adherence to safety standards.
None of the four had reapplied as of Tuesday, Charon Rose, a commission spokesperson said in an email, and a Medici director told Rhode Island Current it would not try again. 
“It takes a lot of work — we’d have to get property again and redo everything,” said Christopher Roy. “And the other problem is the fees — it just makes it impossible to do business.” 
“The office is actively conducting outreach and establishing communication with previously qualified applicants to support their understanding of the process and timeline,” Rose said. “We remain available to answer any questions and are committed to ensuring a smooth and transparent process as we move forward.”
Prospective dispensary owners must pay a $10,000 application fee, but Rose said previously qualified applicants would not have to pay again. Once approved, compassion centers must pay an annual licensing fee of $500,000. If an applicant wants to sell recreational cannabis under a hybrid license, allowed as of 2022, that requires an additional $30,000.
A Zone 1 compassion center would bring the state’s total to eight. The first quarter of 2025 saw nearly $2.9 million in revenue go into the state’s coffers.
Regulators are still working on opening applications for the 24 new retail licenses allowed under the 2022 law that legalized recreational sales.

Ben & Jerry’s leadership wanted to put out a social media post last week in support of migrant community members detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Vermont, but London-based parent company Unilever denied them, according to sources familiar with the matter. 
“The recent detention and deportation of migrant farmworkers in our home state isn’t just a threat to individuals – it’s a threat to the fabric of our communities and our human rights,” the post, crafted by the ice cream making behemoth’s independent board, read. 
The post, which VTDigger viewed, named two individuals recently detained by ICE, Jose Ignacio “Nacho” De La Cruz, 29, and his stepdaughter, Heidi Perez, 18, a recent high school graduate.

Both are prominent leaders with Migrant Justice, a Burlington-based migrant advocacy organization. De La Cruz, a former dairy worker turned construction worker, helped launch the group’s Milk With Dignity campaign, which seeks to provide worker rights and a better life on dairy farms. Ben & Jerry’s was the first major company to join the campaign and agree to purchase milk only from farms that meet the standards of the program. The participating farms the company sources from represent about a fifth of Vermont’s dairy industry. 
“We stand with Migrant Justice and call for transparency, accountability, and the protection of constitutional rights for all,” the proposed post read. “Join us and urge the release of Nacho and Heidi so they can return to their families and community in Vermont.”
The post then linked to a Migrant Justice web page that included an Action Network petition demanding the release of De La Cruz and Perez. VTDigger is not naming the sources who shared the post due to their concerns about retaliation. 
De La Cruz and Perez were driving home to Chittenden County from delivering food to migrant farmworkers in Franklin County when they were pulled over by U.S. Customs and Border Protection due to “suspicious border activity,” according to a CBP spokesperson. De La Cruz’s window was smashed and they were detained.

De La Cruz is currently held in the Northwest State Correctional Facility in Swanton and Perez is being held at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, according to the state prisoner locator. They are both citizens of Mexico without legal immigration status in the U.S.
Unilever did not respond to multiple requests for comment by the time of publication on Tuesday. 
The Vermont-based ice cream maker has long aligned with progressive causes, including the Black Lives Matter movement and Palestinian rights campaigns in recent years. The company does so under an independent board that was established when Ben & Jerry’s was acquired by Unilever in 2000 to maintain the brand’s social mission.
But disputes between the brand and Unilever have ramped up since the election of President Donald Trump last year. 
In November, Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in U.S. District Court in New York, claiming the parent company shut down statements to support Palestinian rights. In January, they alleged Unilever barred them from criticizing President Trump in a social media post on the day of his inauguration. 
In March, after Unilever fired CEO David Stever, Ben & Jerry’s again sued Unilever, alleging Stever was fired for his commitment to the social mission and without properly consulting the brand’s independent board, according to court filings. 
Stever had been with the company since 1987 and moved into the role of CEO in 2023. The complaint stated that the motive for removing Stever was “his commitment to Ben & Jerry’s Social Mission and Essential Brand Integrity … rather than any genuine concerns regarding his performance history.”
The dispute comes as the arrests of Vermont’s migrant residents have ramped up under the second Trump administration, including detainment of nine farm workers in April and the deportation of four. In May, four landscape workers and ten construction workers were also detained by Border Patrol agents in northern Vermont.

The lawsuit, first reported Tuesday by the Washington Post, targets the leadership of the Virginia Military Institute, the University of Virginia and George Mason University. It asks the court to bar the contested board members from continuing to serve and declare that any board member who permits them to remain is violating their legal duties.
The dispute stems from a June 9 vote by the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, which rejected eight of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointments — including former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and former state commerce and trade secretary Caren Merrick.
At the center of the clash is a standoff between Attorney General Jason Miyares and Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who issued duelling letters to university rectors interpreting the fallout.
Miyares argued the appointees may continue to serve until the General Assembly reconvenes in January. Surovell, however, maintains that their terms ended immediately with the Senate’s vote.
The legal challenge underscores a broader power struggle between the Republican governor and the Democratic-controlled Senate over influence on public university boards. Democrats say Youngkin is stacking boards with ideologues to reshape policy.
Miyares said Tuesday evening that the board members in question had been lawfully appointed. 
“I think it is very unfortunate to see certain individuals in the state Senate that want to try to politicize the governance of these boards and just somehow remove these people. I think they’re wrong in the law,” he said.
Youngkin said that his administration has been working to combat illegal discrimination at Virginia’s universities and schools. He called the lawsuit an example of Democrats promoting the latter.
“The fact that they are challenging my appointees is not only meritless, but it’s a waste of time,” Youngkin said. “It’s a waste of money and it’s a waste of people’s efforts. The commonwealth is doing incredibly well, and I would just encourage my Democrat friends to work productively on real things versus wasting everybody’s time on this meritless effort when, in fact, we’re going to all be together in making sure there’s no discrimination on our university campuses.”
However, Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, pushed back against Youngkin’s assertion. 
“We will not tolerate Governor Youngkin violating our constitution to keep extremists on university boards. The Senate has acted and our decision is final,” Lucas posted on X, formerly Twitter.
Surovell added that he was “proud” to stand with Lucas in defending the rule of law of Virginia.
“If Donald Trump and his allies want to burn it down at the federal level, we’ll make sure it still stands strong here in the commonwealth,” Surovell posted on X.
Following the June 9 meeting, Surovell reminded the heads of Virginia’s public universities in a letter that same day that state code requires all governing board members to be confirmed by the General Assembly. He wrote that lawmakers “will not confirm individuals who do not possess the judgment, character, or willingness to follow the principles” outlined in the letter.
Those principles include an understanding of fiduciary duties, a commitment to independent institutional governance, and a pledge to avoid excessive partisan inclinations.
During the meeting, two Republican committee members defended the governor’s appointees, but it wasn’t enough to sway the Democratic-controlled panel, which voted to reject them. 
Republican lawmakers also raised concerns about why a joint subcommittee — composed of Senate and House Privileges and Elections committees members — had not met to review the appointees’ statements and economic interests, as required by state code. The committee’s attorney said he was not aware of whether the subcommittee was currently active. 
In a June 10 letter to Secretary of the Commonwealth Kelly Gee, who manages gubernatorial appointments, Senate Clerk Susan Clarke Schaar confirmed that the committee’s action is “effective immediately.”
Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, who does not serve on the committee, predicted Tuesday that the lawsuit would be dismissed because, in his view, the General Assembly had not formally rejected the appointments. 
“The lawsuit filed by Senate Dems is a pure political stunt,” Obenshain wrote. “Despite an earlier letter she sent ‘at the direction’ of Senate Dems, the Senate Clerk agrees: the General Assembly has not refused to confirm the Governor’s appointments. It’s an easy call — dismissed with prejudice.”
Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, voiced support for the lawsuit, saying it was necessary to uphold the state constitution and prevent overreach by the executive branch. 
“This lawsuit is an essential and necessary defense of our constitution, our legislative authority, and the institutional checks and balances that protect Virginia’s democracy,” Hashmi said in a statement. “The governor and attorney general’s actions not only flout the clear mandates of the Virginia Constitution, but they also disregard the will of the Senate and undermine the General Assembly’s critical role in overseeing appointments to our public university boards.”
Last Friday, the governor announced a slate of new appointments to governing boards at several Virginia colleges and universities. None of the previously rejected nominees were included.
The Senate committee responsible for reviewing appointments has not yet scheduled its next meeting.

(Contributed/Northern Plains UAS Test Site)Drones are helping residents of storm-damaged areas in eastern North Dakota find personal items scattered during tornadoes and straight-line winds.
Enderlin native Sadie Rudolph posted on social media Monday calling on drone operators to help search for items taken away by the series of storms that rolled across North Dakota on Friday. In less than 24 hours, the post was shared more than 180 times with many people reaching out to add lost items to the list and to see how they could help.
“We’ve got a lot of people looking for things that have been scattered for miles,” said Rudolph, who now lives in West Fargo. 


How to help
The North Dakota Community Foundation has set up a storm relief fund. Financial donations will be provided to impacted communities and homeowners to assist with disaster recovery and unmet needs.


Rudolph said someone reached out to her on social media to report that a letter with an Enderlin address was found more than 90 miles away in Ulen, Minnesota.
“The sheer craziness of how far the storm took this stuff, it’s just mind-boggling,” she said. 
The Northern Plains UAS Test Site based in Grand Forks responded to the call for help. Three drones and pilots were searching for property in the Enderlin and Sheldon areas on Tuesday, said Victor Meza, marketing manager. 
A severe storm that produced multiple tornadoes, hail and high winds hit North Dakota over the weekend, claiming three lives in Enderlin. 
Residents asked drone pilots for help locating missing saddles, generators, tools, utility vehicles, a horse trailer and a pickup truck, among other items, that vanished during the storms.
“It’s not just clothes or things like that, but mainly trying to find bigger items that are still missing,” Meza said.

This is the first time drones from the Northern Plains UAS Test Site are being used to search for items after a tornado, Meza said. The Grand Forks test site is one of seven approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to research how to safely integrate unmanned aerial systems into the national airspace.
The organization previously helped Grand Forks with aerial flooding observations. Drones also were used by energy companies after the 2024 Christmas ice storm to locate downed power lines faster than personnel on foot, he said.
“Manpower can be expensive and it can be exhausting,” Meza said. Swamps and bogs can be difficult to search on the ground, but drones provide a much easier way to search those areas completely, he said. Meza added it also allows search personnel to be diverted to other areas with higher needs.
“If we can save five to 10 people from going in one direction … it expands the search even more,” Meza said.

Drone teams can deploy within about 10 minutes of arriving at a scene, he said. After searching on Tuesday morning, Meza said they had not found many of the larger items, but they are finding a lot of large pieces of debris and metal poles in the fields that will need to be moved before fields can be harvested.
The drones being flown in Enderlin are using Vantis, North Dakota’s statewide uncrewed aircraft system that allows drones to be flown beyond the visual line of sight. The network, which has received state funding, allows the drones to monitor air traffic in the area and extends their range.
“This is more than technology; it’s neighbors helping neighbors, and we’re honored to be part of that,” said Erin Roesler, deputy executive director for Northern Plains UAS Test Site.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The overrepresentation of Native Americans in state prisons, a lack of rehabilitation programming, and a need for more intervention to keep people out of prison are the biggest issues flagged by members of South Dakota’s legislative recidivism and rehabilitation committee.
The group held its first meeting Monday at the University of South Dakota’s Sioux Falls campus. The committee is tasked with analyzing the makeup of the prison population, comparing incarceration rates and sentencing laws in similar states, and identifying barriers to inmates’ reintegration into society. 
South Dakota has the nation’s 15th-highest incarceration rate, according to The Sentencing Project. Forty-three percent of adult offenders in South Dakota return to prison within three years of release, according to 2023 statistics from the state Department of Corrections.
Some lawmakers who voted in February against funding to build an $825 million men’s prison said the state should be investing more into rehabilitation programs to reduce its prison population.
Lawmakers on the recidivism and rehabilitation committee may propose bills and funding recommendations during the next legislative session. Some members of the committee also sit on the governor’s Project Prison Reset committee, which is searching for a location to build a new prison at a cost up to $600 million.
Mitchell Republican Rep. Jeff Bathke is the former director of substance abuse programs for the state Department of Corrections and a member of the recidivism and rehabilitation committee. He hopes the group will dig further into rehabilitation and behavioral health programming to understand existing programs and their efficacy.

“Right now, we’re just a warehouse. We warehouse people,” Bathke told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting. “Then they come back because we did nothing as a community to help them.”
The first meeting supported his belief that the state should hire a consultant to better evaluate the prison system and make recommendations to policy and programming. The state has hired a consultant to study prison construction needs, and that consultant said strict sentencing laws are among the factors driving prison population growth.
“This is a severely damaged system,” Bathke said. “But it can be great. It can be the best program in the nation, with some changes.”
Indigenous overrepresentation
Native Americans account for nearly 40% of the state’s prison inmates. They account for about 9% of the state’s overall population, according to a presentation from the Legislative Research Council.
That statistic is “alarming,” said Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, during the meeting. Sioux Falls Republican Rep. Greg Jamison, who co-chairs the committee, told lawmakers he believes the overrepresentation is one of the “biggest issues” facing the committee.

The disparity of Native Americans in the prison system has persisted for decades. Bathke added that offenders sentenced in federal court after crimes on tribal land aren’t accounted for in the state data.
“It is way worse than what these numbers actually show,” Bathke said.

South Dakota’s disparity is higher than similar states analyzed by the committee: Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming. Legislative staff compared the states’ prison populations because they share economic and demographic similarities.
Jamison said he hopes to connect with tribal leaders this summer to hear their suggestions for addressing the problem. 
South Dakota also has the third highest female incarceration rate in the nation, according to The Sentencing Project. Nearly two-thirds of incarcerated women in the state are Native American, and about half of their worst offenses are drug-related.
North Dakota has the lowest prison population in the four-state comparison presented to the committee, at under 2,000 inmates, along with the lowest incarceration rate and lowest female incarceration rate.
“We’re going to have to dig into North Dakota a bit,” Jamison said.
‘Rehabilitation is important, and we are failing’
Several lawmakers and members of the public raised concerns about rehabilitation programming — both the quality of programs and the number of programs available to inmates. A Department of Corrections employee was not on hand to answer lawmaker questions.
Leaders of a company that trained and employed maximum security inmates at the state penitentiary for two decades said they were pushed out of the prison system by administrators last year, although administrators said the company left voluntarily to avoid adhering to newer, stricter security protocols. Gov. Larry Rhoden announced this week his administration will use economic development dollars from the state’s Future Fund to start a diesel mechanic training program in the metal shop’s former space.

Linsey Sapp, whose husband is incarcerated, told lawmakers during public comment that the lack of classes and programming is a serious concern, especially if inmates are spending “23 hours a day” in their cells. 
“Rehabilitation is important, and we are failing,” she said.
Tracii Barse, a Native American business owner who introduced himself as a seven-time felon to lawmakers, said mentorship during and after a prison sentence is necessary to successfully reintegrate inmates into society.
He suggested policy changes to allow ex-inmates to come into the prison to teach classes or mentor current inmates. While there are several volunteers who mentor, former prisoners better understand inmates’ history and challenges, he said.
Barse finds it ironic that he’s allowed to enter a school to mentor children, despite his background, but he can’t use that same experience and connection to help inmates.
Intervention and understanding reoffending
Sen. Tamara Grove, R-Lower Brule, encouraged lawmakers on the committee to explore the path that leads a person to prison and reasons why people reoffend. In better understanding those areas, the state can intervene, deter and help people while they’re in their home, she added.

Doing so would be cheaper, healthier, and keep a community intact — especially given the number of Native Americans removed from their communities due to incarceration, Grove said.
Grove, along with Sen. Kevin Jensen, R-Canton, discussed the possibility of removing a person’s felony conviction from their record for certain crimes after an amount of time or after rehabilitation, to help with reintegration and recidivism. Felons are not allowed to live in certain neighborhoods, can’t have some jobs and can’t own a gun.
“I think, at some point, it has to be where the person has paid for their crime and they move back to wholeness in whatever way that looks,” Grove said. “I think that’s a really big part of re-entry.”
The committee’s next meeting will be held in July in the Rapid City area.

The Republican-led state Senate passed both measures earlier this year. Senate Bill 227 targets K-12 education, while Senate Bill 558 focuses on public colleges and universities. The bills would prohibit what sponsors describe as “divisive concepts” from being taught in the classroom.
During a debate in the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday morning, where the bills were first heard before moving to the Rules Committee, Republicans argued the legislation prevents teaching that one race is superior to another. Opponents, however, contend the bills will chill academic freedom and honest discussions about historical oppression.
Tamika Walker Kelly, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, said Senate Bill 227 “sends a painful message that valuing diversity, equity and inclusion is somehow wrong, that standing up for every child and teaching every student that they matter is wrong.”
The ACLU of North Carolina warned the bills raise constitutional concerns and could lead to self-censorship among educators.
“These bills will censor curricula on race, gender and the lived experiences of marginalized groups in the classroom,” said Reighlah Collins, Policy Counsel for the ACLU of North Carolina, during a public comment portion of the committee hearing.
Part of a broader anti-DEI campaign
The push against DEI in schools is part of a broader attack on the concepts by Republican lawmakers in the state and across the country. Another bill, House Bill 171 (“Equality in State Agencies/Prohibition on DEI”) would ban state agencies from promoting, supporting, funding, implementing or maintaining workplace DEI, including in hirings, dedicated staff positions and offering or requiring DEI training. 
The bill passed the House along party lines in April, and the Senate currently considering a newer version of the bill.
Both Senate Bill 227 and 558 now move to the House floor for a vote.
To overcome a potential veto from Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, House Republicans would need at least one Democrat to vote with them.

Ned Lamont has turned to repairing relationships frayed by his vetoes of priorities of Democrats and party legislative leaders.,"Gov. Ned Lamont has turned to repairing relationships frayed by his vetoes of an omnibus housing bill and a measure that would have provided jobless benefits for strikers, both priorities of various elements of the Democratic coalition and its party’s legislative leaders.
Lamont’s veto of the housing bill came without a courtesy call to House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, one of the bill’s key sponsors and a man with whom the governor’s administration now must negotiate to save portions of the most significant housing bill to reach the governor’s desk.
A call to Rojas was one of the first Lamont made after the veto Monday. Another went to Ed Hawthorne, the president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, the labor federation that worked successfully with the Democratic governor on a significant list of first-term labor victories.
The challenge now facing Lamont became clear in two very different conversations: one with a legislative leader who sees and is ready to grasp the building blocks of a housing deal; the other with a union man who sees Lamont unfeeling about workers and immovable on an issue that has come to the fore for labor.
“I was very frank with him,” Hawthorne said in an interview Tuesday. “The state elected Democrats, and Democrats put two bills on his desk that would have made a difference to working people. And he sided with Republicans.”
Lamont cast himself as a labor ally, a Democrat horrified at the Trump administration’s efforts to cripple the influence of public sector unions in the federal workforce and its removal of labor-friendly members of the National Labor Relations Board.
“I think about labor rights, and I think about what the Trump administration is doing to the NLRB and the rights of our workers to organize, rights of our workers to stand up to themselves. We’re trying to do everything we can,” Lamont said Tuesday at a public event at the state Capitol.
In his veto message the previous day about Senate Bill 8, which would have provided jobless benefits to strikers in Connecticut, the governor enumerated the first-term victories he helped deliver for the labor movement.
They included a higher minimum wage, a nearly universal mandate for paid sick time, paid family and medical leave coverage, expanded collective bargaining rights for public employees, and protections for workers who leave captive audience meetings. 
“Connecticut workers are the backbone of our economy,” Lamont wrote in his message. “I strongly support their right to organize, advocate for better conditions, and be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace.”
Hawthorne acknowledged the governor did those things, but he noted that federal labor law largely preempts states from enhancing the standing of unions to organize workers or negotiate contracts. One notable exception, Hawthorne said, is a state’s ability to remove the prohibition on striking workers collecting unemployment.
“When we asked him to sit down to talk about the [strikers’] bill, the response was, ‘Think of something else,’” Hawthorne said. “But everything else was preempted by federal law.”
The governor, who was elected in 2018, reelected in 2022 and is considering running again in 2026, also has a what-have-you-done-lately problem with labor.
“There’s first-term Ned Lamont and second-term Ned Lamont,” Hawthorne said. “He mentions the minimum wage — first term; paid family leave — first term; expanded collective bargaining — first term.”
The list goes on.
“We can’t live off the past when the president and Congress want to destroy every gain we’ve made in the last 15 years,” Hawthorne said. “We need a fighter, like first term Ned.”
Only New York and New Jersey provide jobless benefits for strikers. Oregon just passed legislation that would do so. Lamont has supporters strikers in Connecticut, sometimes visiting picket lines.
“But I think paying striking workers is a bridge too far and doesn’t help our cause. I think that some people say … ‘you’re too pro-labor’ or ‘you’re too pro-business,’ ” Lamont said. “I think I’m pro-jobs, and I want to watch out for any bill which I think discourages jobs in this state.”
Sen. Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, a retired UAW executive, said there is little room for compromise on the strikers’ bill, which would have provided jobless benefits after two weeks out of work. Passage eventually will come, but probably not while Lamont is governor, she said.
“I do like the governor. He is right on so many issues, but he is so wrong on this,” said Kushner, who called Lamont “stubborn.”

Gary Winfield, left, and Rep. Jason Rojas. Rojas is now negotiating with Lamont over a new housing bill. Credit: MARK PAZNIOKAS / CTMIRROR.ORG
On housing, there is room to negotiate.
Rojas ignored the slight of a veto that came without a heads-up and focused on the possibility to salvage the essence of House Bill 5002. 
Among other things, it would have required municipalities to set “fair share” goals for affordable housing, prioritize state aid to communities that build housing, and streamline approval for so-called “middle housing,” defined as a building with two to nine units.
Rojas said he was encouraged at the governor’s seeming support for establishing the conversion of commercial lots as something developers can do “as of right” for middle housing. But he was concerned that Lamont, in his view, seemed overly deferential to municipal officials.
The governor expects local officials will come to the table and negotiate a new version of 5002 over the next 90 days.
“I’m skeptical,” Rojas said. “In 45 days, most will be thinking about being up for election.”
The Connecticut Mirror reached Rojas by telephone after he finished a panel discussion at Princeton University on fair housing. The event was tied to the 50th anniversary of New Jersey adopting a fair-share requirement for municipalities to assess affordable housing needs.
In 1975, the New Jersey Supreme Court established the “Mount Laurel Doctrine,” requiring all communities to take responsibility for a share of a region’s affordable housing needs. The decision came in a challenge to restrictive zoning, and it kicked off further litigation and decades of legislation.
Rojas said participants were consoling and encouraging, reminding him that passing significant housing bills is a marathon, as they learned after Mount Laurel. Rojas, whose daughter is a runner, is hoping for a shorter race.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7912-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state’s correctional officers can sue the Department of Corrections as a class in an effort to get compensation for the time it takes the officers to be screened by security when coming to and leaving from work. 
In 2020, an officer filed a class action lawsuit against DOC arguing that the pre and post shift activities should be compensated. A Milwaukee County judge divided the case into two parts, separating the certification of correctional officers as a class from the evaluation of their argument on the merits. 
The circuit court judge granted the motion for class certification but that decision was reversed by the court of appeals, which ruled that the officers couldn’t be certified as a class because their argument was unlikely to be successful. 
In a majority opinion written by Justice Janet Protasiewicz, the Court reversed the appeals court’s decision, stating that to certify a class action lawsuit a judge must determine if the group at issue has a common question without evaluating the answer to that question.
DOC-ClassAction
“There is a difference between identifying whether a common question exists and deciding its answer,” Protasiewicz wrote. “A court ‘must walk a balance between evaluating evidence to determine whether a common question exists and predominates, without weighing that evidence to determine whether the plaintiff class will ultimately prevail on the merits.’”
Protasiewicz’s opinion was joined by Justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Rebecca Dallet, Brian Hagedorn and Jill Karofsky. Chief Justice Annette Ziegler wrote a partial concurrence, which was joined by Justice Rebecca Bradley. 
The attorney for the DOC officers who brought the case said in a statement that his clients appreciate the Court’s decision.
“Our clients appreciate the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s well-reasoned decision reversing the Court of Appeals and reinstating the Circuit Court’s decision to certify a class of Wisconsin corrections officers,” the attorney, Michael Flannery, said in the statement. “Corrections officers are the largest officer force in the State of Wisconsin, and do a vital and incredibly difficult job. It is simply unfair that, for years, Wisconsin has forced them to do unpaid work before and after their shifts. We look forward to litigating this case through trial and getting some of Wisconsin’s hardest workers the economic justice they so deserve.”

Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Tuesday the state is filing three lawsuits against CVS and its affiliates alleging they engaged in “unfair, deceptive, and unlawful” trade practices. (Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal)Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Tuesday the state is filing three lawsuits against CVS and its affiliates alleging they engaged in “unfair, deceptive, and unlawful” trade practices. 
Joined by dozens of independent pharmacists at the state Capitol, Landry and Murrill condemned the company for using customer information to launch a political text message campaign earlier this month. The messages called on recipients, including state employees, to oppose a bill in the Louisiana Legislature that would have prohibited pharmacies from also owning pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which operate as “middlemen” that oversee prescription drug programs for insurance companies and large employers. The bill failed to pass both chambers before the session ended. 
Caremark, a CVS subsidiary, holds the PBM contract with the state Office of Group Benefits, which provides prescription coverage for most state employees and public school teachers.     
Critics of PBMs argue they are responsible for high medication prices, and independent pharmacists allege they unfairly favor large corporate pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens. Some of the nation’s largest pharmacy chains, including CVS, also operate a PBM. 
In the final days of the legislative session, which ended earlier this month, CVS sent texts to customers saying the legislation would cause them to close all of their pharmacy locations in Louisiana. First Lady Sharon Landry was among the recipients, the governor shared Tuesday, as was Murrill. 
The governor directed Murrill to investigate the text messages, which led to the lawsuits, she said. All three were filed in St. Landry Parish.

“They used our information to lobby for their own corporate interests and to scare people into lobbying on their behalf,” Murrill said. “At least one or two of those text messages that I saw … threatened seniors, veterans and people with serious healthcare conditions, and said that you might not be able to get your medication, or if you do, you may have to pay more.” 
“All of those things are deceptive, in my opinion, and certainly misleading,” Murrill added. 
In an emailed statement, CVS spokeswoman Amy Thibault said the text messages were legal. The company denies using information obtained from state employees from the Office of Group Benefits. 
The first of Murrill’s lawsuits directly addresses the text messages, which she alleges was an improper use of customer data as well as a violation of “established standards of decency.” 
The second lawsuit targets the CVS “vertical integration” model, in which one company controls multiple stages of the supply chain. 
“Just like Congress prohibited all companies from owning the gas pump, we should ban PBMs from monopolizing so that they own the drug counter,” Landry said. “When you let middlemen control everything, it’s not a free market. It’s a rigged market.” 
“By combining health care delivery, pharmacy, health care benefits, and pharmacy benefit management, we make it easier for people to have what they want the most: a connected care experience,” Thibault said in the CVS statement. 
The third lawsuit alleges CVS’s business practices violate Louisiana’s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, harming the state’s independent pharmacies. 
In a news release, Murrill alleged CVS uses its industry influence to impose “unethical and exceedingly high fees” on independent pharmacies under threat of being expelled from the CVS network. 
“CVS is abusing its enormous market power to engage in covert spread pricing to further enrich itself at the expense of the independent pharmacies in its network,” Murrill wrote in her news release.
Critics have accused PBMs of spread pricing, when health plan providers or large employers are charged higher prices for prescription drugs than what the PBMs pay the pharmacy that fills the order. PBMs then keep the “spread” as profit.
PBMs insist spread pricing places the risk on their business when pharmacies raise their prices to fill prescriptions, forcing the PMBs to eat any costs. When there is a spread, PBMs say it goes toward their administrative expenses. The goal is to encourage consistent pricing for coverage plans and customers, according to PMBs.   
While Landry previously promised to call the legislature back to Baton Rouge for a special session to address PBMs, he said Tuesday he will first explore the possibility of taking unilateral executive branch action. 
Landry says he is convening a working group, that will include Murrill, to explore what options are available to him.

While legislation to prohibit pharmacies from owning PBMs failed, legislators did pass House Bill 264 by Rep. Mike Echols, R-Monroe, which requires PBMs to be more transparent with their practices with state regulators and pass on more savings to customers. Landry announced his intention to sign the legislation.

According to May data released Tuesday, the preliminary state unemployment rate ticked up from the revised 2.7% rate for May 2024.
Prior to the pandemic, Nebraska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was consistently around 3% then shot up above 8% during the pandemic before dropping to around 2% and then rising to the 3% mark in February.

According to other newly released labor data, Nebraska ranks No. 6 among states with the lowest seasonally adjusted unemployment rates. The national rate for May 2025 is 4.2%, unchanged from the previous month and up from the 4.0% reported for May 2024.
Nebraska labor officials have said the higher unemployment rate of late appears to be driven by an increase in the state labor force. They said when a person begins searching for work, he or she is classified as unemployed until finding a job.
The Nebraska Department of Labor reports that the total number of filled nonfarm jobs reached a historic high in May, with 1,073,696 jobs. 
“This surpasses the prior high in October of 2024 by over 5,000 filled jobs,” Nebraska Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber said in a Tuesday news release.
Private Nebraska industries with the most growth compared to the same month a year ago were private education and health services (up 6,599 jobs) and leisure and hospitality (up 4,217 jobs).
Numbers of employed and unemployed people in the labor force are based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey that asks a person’s employment status. 
The labor force includes both employed workers and those actively looking for work. Those not working or seeking a job are not considered part of the labor force and are held out of the unemployment rate calculation.

Mike Braun answers reporter questions about execution drugs on Tuesday, June 24, 2025, in Indianapolis. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun confirmed Tuesday that Indiana spent more than $1 million in taxpayer funds to purchase four doses of execution drugs — some which were used, and several others that expired.
He also clarified that the drugs were purchased in two transactions — one under former Gov. Eric Holcomb and one by him.
In total, $1.175 million was spent, Braun said. But two of those — worth $600,000 — expired with no use because “they had been on the shelf too long.”
Braun emphasized Tuesday, however, that neither of the doses used by the Indiana Department of Correction in December and May were expired when administered to inmates.
Reporting by the Indiana Capitol Chronicle previously revealed that at least $900,000 was spent by Holcomb’s administration to purchase pentobarbital. The execution drug was used in December to carry out the death penalty for convicted killer Joseph Corcoran, and again in May for the execution of Benjamin Ritchie.
Braun says Indiana is out of execution drugs, signals willingness to debate capital punishment

“It was tricky, because if you acquired it, and there was some type of glitch, then you go into the same thing that happened with the Holcomb administration, which bought three (doses) — anticipating more (executions). But in course, two expired, so we were careful to make sure it looked like all the administrative parts (of the judicial process) were done,” Braun said, adding that his administration waited until “right before” Ritchie’s execution before buying any new doses of the drug.
“We knew that was going to be a fait accompli,” he continued. “I was careful, so that it looked like (the execution) was going to take place, and not have something occur. And that was a little tricky. But at that point, the Indiana Supreme Court and the parole board would have been all that was left to get through. Administratively, that looked like it had a pretty defined time frame. … It was a question of when you were going to actually get it and not be stranded with it.”
Braun denied Ritchie clemency less than a week before the execution.
Braun’s office confirmed Tuesday that his predecessor paid $900,000 for three doses of the drug. Only one of those doses was used, however; the other two doses expired. Braun said earlier this month that the drug has a 90-shelf life.
After taking office, Braun authorized an additional purchase of the drug earlier this year for $275,000. That covered one dose of pentobarbital, used for Ritchie’s May 20 execution.
It’s not clear when exactly the state acquired the doses or where they were purchased from. State law protects the identity of the seller from public scrutiny. State officials had previously declined to provide details about how much pentobarbital was purchased, and refused to provide information on expiration dates, storage or other details.
“You’re dealing with a source of (the execution drugs) that’s very hard to pin down,” Braun said. “If it’s going to be available, it’s not like you can get it from several places.”
The governor additionally reiterated his desire for state lawmakers to weigh in.
“I’m going to encourage the state legislature to look at it — in terms of, is that what we’re going to use, and then on the issue itself,” he said, referring to capital punishment and lethal injections. “I’m very agnostic on that. I want them to weigh in.”

The 80-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday centers on how the Trump administration has interpreted a five-word section of federal regulations to rationalize a “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign,” abruptly terminating billions in already awarded funding to state and local governments, research institutions, universities and more.
The full, 2020 rule promoted by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget states that federal agencies can cut off grants “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” OMB made clear that federal agencies can only terminate grants when there is evidence that the money is not achieving its intended goals or that there is cause to “significantly question” feasibility of achieving the goal.

Today, I’m suing the Trump Administration alongside 19 other states and Washington DC to stop them from arbitrarily canceling funding owed to Pennsylvania.

But Trump’s administration in a Feb. 26 executive order selectively picked five words from the regulation “no longer effectuates…agency priorities” — to justify abrupt cuts to federal aid.
“In effectuating this directive, Agency Defendants now assert—for the first time— that the Clause means something completely new: That the Clause permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind,” the lawsuit states.
Since the initial order authorizing the Department of Government Efficiency to get involved in federal agency grant distributions, the same phrase has featured prominently in subsequent orders, agency memos and explanations for slashing billions of dollars in aid to a wide host of recipients across the country.

“It’s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,” Neronha said in a statement. “Nearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called ‘agency priorities clause.’ Here, we are proactively asking the Courts to put a stop to the nonsense. The President cannot withhold Congressionally-allocated federal funds from the states, and this clause is no loophole.”
The complaint, which names a dozen federal agency heads as defendants, offers a litany of examples of the consequences of abrupt cuts to already awarded federal grants and aid: losing habitat restoration in Maine, ending efforts to combat hate crimes in New Jersey, ceasing shelter programs for migrants in Illinois released from overcrowded federal detention centers and cutting off research of air quality risks from wildfire smoke in rural Nevada.
“With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived States of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more,” the lawsuit states.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Rhode Island, cuts have affected a pair of University of Rhode Island research  grants funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and National Science Foundation, along with modernization of the state unemployment insurance system via U.S. Department of Labor funding.
Even federal aid still flowing remains at risk, compromising safety and support to people who qualify for food assistance programs and those who live in flood zones, farmers, minority students, scientists, and more, the lawsuit states.
Arguing that the federal administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procuredures Act, the AGs have asked a federal judge to permanently clarify that federal regulations do not grant federal agencies “unfettered power” to terminate funding already awarded. Or, as an alternative, they have asked a judge to toss the Trump administration’s interpretation of the clause in question. The request, if granted, would apply to all existing and future federal grants.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the federal agencies, declined to comment on the lawsuit in an email Tuesday.
In addition to Neronha, the other AGs who filed the complaint represent Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa DNR) Years of drought conditions on Iowa’s western edge have lowered water levels at Blue Lake and impacted recreation at the lake. 
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is hosting a public meeting Thursday in Onawa to discuss the low water levels and the department’s ongoing studies and lake restoration projects at Blue Lake. 
200 years ago, when the Lewis and Clark expedition came through the region, the oxbow lake was an active channel of the Missouri River, but now it is fed by a small watershed off of the Missouri River, and is located in Lewis and Clark State Park just west of Onawa. 
According to DNR’s annual lake restoration report, Blue Lake has a number of “aesthetically objectionable conditions” like algal blooms, and low water clarity that contributed to decreased recreational use. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
 Since the early 2000s DNR has been working to restore the lake via chemical restoration, removal of “rough” fish and selective dredging. 
Water levels in the Missouri River have been “especially low” over the past five winters, which led to low groundwater levels in the region and impacted not only Blue Lake levels, but water in communities throughout western Iowa.
The lake is currently about five feet below its crest elevation, or the fullest pool of the lake. Ben Wallace, a fisheries biologist who has worked on Blue Lake’s restoration projects said drop means the lake has about one third of its full-pool volume. 
Wallace said the informational meeting Thursday will help address concerns within the community about the low lake levels and to explain DNR’s work at Blue Lake. 
“When we enter into these drought cycles, access gets tougher at these lakes, because the water starts to recede from the shoreline,” Wallace said. “And yeah, some lakes get hit harder than others with the drought.” 
According to the DNR report, the Lake Restoration Program spent about $10,000 on a dredging and fish barrier project at Blue Lake in the 2023-2024 fiscal year and allocated $265,000 in fiscal year 2025 for well and pump assessment, fish renovation and containment site improvements at the lake. 
Wallace said some folks in the community have questioned if the DNR’s dredging work contributed to the lake’s low levels, but he said lake restoration work is done very “systematically” with the “entire picture” in mind. 
Iowans across the state asked to conserve water due to dry wells, high nitrate levels

“We just don’t go into things blind,” Wallace said. “We get a pretty good understanding of things before we execute large scale construction projects like this.” 
Plus, Wallace said this isn’t the first time Blue Lake has had levels this low. He said historic maps of the region show levels just as low, if not lower in the 1930s. 
“All of these lakes that I’ve had throughout my district have gone through drought cycles about once every 10 to 12 years, and sometimes those droughts are more severe and they’re a little bit longer than other but in my experience, they all bounce back,” Wallace said. 
He said water levels in the lake are about on par with groundwater levels in the region. That type of drought takes more than just a good rain to replenish.
“Each year a successive drought just takes that much more to recharge the groundwater level,” Wallace said. “It’s going to have to be a return to average or above average precipitation levels for some time, because we’re not just talking about bringing up the lake — we’re talking about bringing up the water in the ground.”
Restoration work at the lake has also addressed turbidity, or water clarity, by eliminating and blocking common carp from the lake. 
Wallace said these bottom-feeding fish continually stir up the sediment on the bottom of the lake which causes cloudy water, poor conditions for other fish and makes it easier for algae to bloom on the surface. 
Wallace said common carp are a problem at a lot of lakes in Iowa, but high densities in Blue Lake have impacted the water quality. DNR’s lake restoration efforts included the installation of fish barriers and aggressive carp angling in the lake to help reduce the common carp populations. 
In addition to the work to restore the lake, Lewis and Clark State Park Manager Nathan Fylstra said his team has been working hard to improve the state park with updates to the visitor’s center, improved drainage systems and a general clean up of ditches and fences. 
“We’ve been changing a lot of stuff, revamping a lot of stuff,” Fylstra said. “It should look a lot better.” 
The park is adjacent to the 250-acre Blue Lake, which typically hosts summer swimmers, boaters and anglers. 
Wallace encouraged anyone with an interest in Blue Lake to attend the informational meeting Thursday at the Onawa Community Center, 320 10th Street, at 5:30 p.m. 
“Show up and ask questions,” Wallace said. “I am looking forward to the opportunity to demonstrate the lengths that we went to in studying this lake and this lake system.”

(Screenshot of livestreamed meeting)COLUMBIA — Columbia no longer bans so-called conversion therapy for minors following City Council’s second 4-3 vote Tuesday to repeal the 4-year-old rule.
The repeated split vote — exactly one week after the first one — came without debate, despite residents’ pleas over roughly an hour to “fight back” against Republicans seeking the Governor’s Mansion. It was the final vote needed to undo the ordinance threatening a $500 fine for licensed therapists who attempt to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of an LGBTQ+ minor.
No one has been fined under the rule since its inception, according to the mayor’s office.
Mayor Daniel Rickenmann, among the four who voted “yes” to repeal, has said the ordinance lacks teeth to actually do anything, noting every case reported as a potential violation involved a religious group not covered by the ban.
But advocates of LGBTQ residents called it an important symbol of support and acceptance, as well as a stand against what they said should be called conversion trauma.
The vote ensures Columbia won’t miss out on its $3.7 million share of aid for local governments in the state budget that takes effect July 1. A clause inserted in the budget during the Senate debate threatened to yank the state aid of any city with such a ban, and Columbia is the only city that has one.
Council members twice delayed voting on the repeal as they waited to see whether the clause would survive budget negotiations and become law, which it did.
Additionally, Attorney General Alan Wilson threatened in April to sue over the local rule he contends violates both state law and constitutional free speech rights.
The meeting came a day after both Wilson and the author of the clause, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, announced their bids for governor. Advocates for the rule who spoke out Tuesday told council members they shouldn’t be helping the Republicans’ campaigns and letting them boss the city around.
“For y’all to give in and capitulate without a battle of any kind is strange to me. Where is the outrage?” asked Dr. Isabelle Mandell, a city resident. “You haven’t tried. You haven’t fought it.”
Attorney Nekki Shutt offered to represent the city for free to defend the rule and challenge the budget clause she called an unconstitutional violation of home rule.
“The city of Columbia is a refuge city in South Carolina for LGBTQ people. It’s where we can feel safe,” she said, adding she never expected to become a South Carolinian. “I laid down roots because I feel safe here.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/columbia-City-council-vote-1024x510.jpg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A hiring freeze, deferred wage raises and delayed hospital maintenance are all on the table at the Hutchinson Regional Health Center as chief executive officer Benjamin Anderson and his team weigh the potential impacts of a federal budget bill that would axe Medicaid, forcing rural hospitals in Kansas to shutter.
Federal lawmakers are scrambling to approve the massive bill, which is replete with major tax cuts and public program reductions, before the Fourth of July. Since the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act was first proposed, Medicaid has been slated for billions in cuts, which has caused advocates and health providers to warn communities and elected officials of dire consequences.
Across the country, rural hospitals will face $70 billion in cuts over the next decade under the current version of the bill.
A report from the National Rural Health Association and Manatt Health, released Tuesday, found that rural hospitals will lose 21 cents out of every dollar they receive for funding Medicaid, the joint state and federal public health insurance program that serves more than 360,000 Kansans.
Kansas is now set to lose more than $4 billion in Medicaid funding if the bill passes in its current form, according to updated estimates from the Hutchinson-based United Methodist Health Ministry Fund. The total losses increased by nearly $280 million after changes to the bill in the U.S. Senate.
Cuts to Medicaid are “best done with a scalpel and not with a machete,” Anderson said during a Tuesday press briefing hosted by the rural health association.
Anderson said he is interested in stewardship of federal funds, but cuts to Medicaid aren’t the right way to do it. Those cuts don’t just threaten the accessibility of the health care system for those on Medicaid but for the entire system, he said.
“Cutting Medicaid actually doesn’t save money because it sends people into the emergency department, where they get the most expensive and inefficient and inappropriate care for their ailment,” he said.
Difficulty accessing quality care, inadequate insurance and existing financial distress are already playing out in the Hutchinson Regional Health Care System, Anderson said. The hospital in Hutchinson, which serves around 100,000 people in central Kansas, must prepare for federal cuts while cutting its own budget by $7.5 million, along with shouldering costs for people without insurance.
“The story of Hutchinson, Kansas, is the story of middle America,” Anderson said.
More than half of rural hospitals in Kansas are at risk of closing, and the report found that Kansas would experience a 15% reduction in total rural Medicaid hospital reimbursement under the proposed bill. Plus, 5,000 Kansans enrolled in Medicaid are expected to lose coverage, according to the report.
The proposed bill passed the U.S. House by a one-vote margin May 22. The U.S. Senate is expected to conduct negotiations this week.
Cindy Mann with Manatt Health, an arm of a national law and consulting firm, said during the press briefing that the cuts to public programs, including Medicaid, within the proposal are designed to reduce spending to partially offset the costs of lost revenue from tax cuts.
“In some states, the cuts are really big, and in other states, they’re bigger,” she said.
Half of all children and one in five adults in rural communities across America rely on Medicaid. Half of all births in rural communities are paid for by Medicaid, according to the report.
All the while, rural health providers are struggling to keep their doors open, Mann said.
The Kansas Republican Congressional delegation has been publicly supportive of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act. Other Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, have said they won’t vote for a bill that cuts Medicaid benefits and targets rural hospitals, according to reporting from Stateline. The U.S. Senate could create a rural hospital stabilization fund to mitigate Medicaid cuts, but specifics on negotiations have yet to be released.
 
In the red
One of Craig Thompson’s greatest fears is what federal cuts might do to maternity care access. Mothers on Medicaid are nearly three times more likely to experience a bad health outcome than a mother on commercial insurance, said Thompson, CEO of Golden Valley Memorial Healthcare in Clinton, Missouri.
Twelve rural hospitals have already closed in Missouri in recent years.
“But that doesn’t really tell the full story,” he said.
At existing care facilities in the state, shifts in the type of care offered have created a lack of health services in rural communities, especially when it comes to maternity care. A similar story has played out in Kansas, where maternity care deserts are commonplace in rural areas.
As CEO of the HCC Network, a collection of six community health centers serving rural areas in Missouri, Toniann Richard often uses the term “whack-a-mole” to describe the necessary approach to the everyday challenges of being a health care leader.
She also used the term to characterize the feeling patients experience when they lose their coverage, which is expected to become more common under the federal proposal. They don’t know what to do, Richard said.
Based on Richard’s unit cost of health care analysis, the fewer people who are insured, the higher the cost of health care will be.
Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, said the federal proposal threatens the viability of rural facilities by eliminating Medicaid coverage and reducing access to care for rural patients.
“It’s very clear that Medicaid cuts will result in rural hospital closures, resulting in loss of access to care for those living in rural America,” he said in a press release.
An updated analysis commissioned by the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund and REACH Healthcare Foundation and conducted by Manatt Health predicts Kansas will lose a combined $826 million in federal and state Medicaid funds in the first year of cuts and $4.05 billion over 10 years. Of that total, Kansas  hospitals are expected to lose $664 million in state and federal Medicaid funding in the first year and $2.8 billion over 10 years. 
Based on updated modeling, about 13,000 fewer Kansans would be able to enroll in Medicaid, which could lead to increased uninsured rates, according to the analysis.
David Jordan, president and CEO of the health fund, encouraged lawmakers to strengthen rural health systems instead of weakening them through the proposal.
“Our hope was for the Senate to protect rural hospitals and minimize coverage loss,” he said in a news release. “However, the plan the Senate is rushing through the process will cut $4 billion from our Medicaid program and make it harder to sustain health care in rural Kansas communities.”
Brenda Sharpe, president and CEO at REACH Healthcare Foundation, said rural hospitals will be uniquely challenged if Medicaid cuts pass. They are often sole sources of preventative care, prenatal visits and mental health support. The cuts put entire communities at risk, she said.
Sixty-three rural hospitals in Kansas are facing closure, and 87% of hospitals in Kansas are operating in the red, according to the fund. Twenty-six are at immediate risk of closure.
“Without them,” Sharpe said, “families may be forced to go without care altogether.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2170045-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSeveral organizations dedicated to preserving free speech and protecting members of the press are calling for the release of a prominent immigration reporter who was detained while covering a protest in Atlanta earlier this month and is now on track to be deported.
Mario Guevara, an Emmy-award winning Spanish language reporter based in metro Atlanta, was initially charged with improperly entering a roadway, obstruction of law enforcement officers and unlawful assembly, all of which were misdemeanors. An immigrant from El Salvador, Guevara had been a legal resident of the U.S. for more than 20 years. However, the misdemeanor charges after his arrest allowed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to place a detainer on him, paving the way for a potential deportation.
He was later transferred into ICE custody and charged with three additional misdemeanors from the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office for distracted driving, failure to obey a traffic control device, and reckless driving, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Body camera footage obtained by the AJC showed Guevara wearing both a helmet and vest marking him as a member of the press as he was arrested, alarming free press advocates. He had been covering a protest against the Trump administration’s immigration policies.
“At the time of his arrest, Guevara was wearing a press vest and clearly identified himself to law enforcement,” Katherine Jacobsen of the nonprofit organization Committee to Protect Journalists wrote in a letter to DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Lorraine Cochran-Johnson. “Video footage indicates that Guevara was in no way obstructing police activity but rather documenting the protest, a matter of public interest.”
In a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the Committee to Protect Journalists and other free press advocates including the Atlanta Press Club, the Georgia First Amendment Foundation and the Georgia chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists urged her to facilitate Guevara’s release.
“We request that he be released on bond and that removal proceedings against him, which were triggered by three misdemeanor charges that seem to conflict with his First Amendment rights as a journalist, be dropped unequivocally and immediately,” the letter states. “If Guevara’s case proceeds, it would represent a grim erosion of both freedom of the press and the rule of law. Journalists who are not U.S. citizens could be at risk of deportation solely because local law enforcement filed misdemeanor charges against them in retaliation for reporting without those charges ever being tried in court.”
Department of Homeland Security’s official account disputed media coverage of the arrest in a post on the social media site X, and confirmed that Guevara “was turned over to ICE custody and has been placed in removal proceedings.”
Guevara is currently being held at the Folkston ICE Processing Center in South Georgia, which is set to become the largest immigrant detention facility in the United States. His legal team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Titus and Horsford photos by Jeniffer Solis, Lee photo by Michael Lyle)The Democrats within Nevada’s congressional delegation are divided in their reactions to the U.S. bombing of Iran, with more progressive members condemning President Donald Trump’s unilateral actions and moderates signaling some level of support.
U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat and the longest-serving member of the delegation, on Tuesday voted to advance articles of impeachment against Trump introduced by U.S. Rep. Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, for abuses of power.
The Trump administration carried out the bombings of three nuclear facilities in Iran over the weekend without providing notice and justification to Congressional leaders, a departure from standard protocol but an increasingly popular shortcut for recent presidents.
Green’s efforts were not expected to get far given Republican control of the House. Titus acknowledged as much in a televised interview Sunday, when she was asked by ABC News about U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s separate public call for impeachment. The “votes aren’t there” to impeach Trump, Titus said.
Titus criticized Trump for launching a war “that Congress has not authorized, Nevadans don’t support, and Trump himself said he would never pursue.”
The House vote Tuesday to table Green’s resolution was 344-79, with all Republicans and 128 Democrats voting to stop the effort. Titus was the only Nevada representative to vote to keep the resolution alive.
Titus told ABC News she signed onto a War Powers Resolution “to prevent further U.S. involvement without Congressional approval.” That bipartisan resolution is sponsored by U.S. Reps. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California.
Like Titus, U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat, issued a statement condemning Trump. He released the statement Monday after Iran retaliated against the U.S. with attacks of its own.
“Right now, air sirens are blaring at U.S. bases across the Middle East because President Trump ignored the dangers that his impulsive air strikes posed for our military personnel,” he said.
Those attacks, on a U.S. military base in Qatar, resulted in no U.S. casualties, national media would later report.
Horsford emphasized that the president “has no authority to entangle the United States in a new war” and that “Congress has not authorized the use of military force.”
He continued, “Trump’s unilateral use of force threatens our troops, undermines our leadership on the world stage, and flies in the face of our Constitution. This Administration must be held accountable, and Congress must assert itself to ensure the American people have a voice in decisions of war and peace.”
While Titus and Horsford outright condemned Trump’s actions, the remaining three members of Nevada’s Democratic delegation in Washington D.C. issued statements suggesting they may find the actions justified.
U.S. Rep. Susie Lee posted on social media that she was awaiting a briefing on “the intelligence that led to the strike and on the status of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.”
She added, “I remain firm in my commitment that Iran cannot be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. It cannot be forgotten that the Iranian regime is responsible for funding global terrorism and killing Americans. The regime’s goal is to access nuclear weapons to use against America, Israel, and our other allies.”
U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen similarly did not condemn the actions. In a statement, she thanked the military service members “for carrying out this limited, targeted, and hopefully decisive action.”
She continued, “The Iranian Regime has made it clear that they will do everything in their power to destroy the United States and Israel, and their nuclear program has been a means to that end.”
Rosen did, however, say in her statement that the president “must involve Congress before taking any further military action against Iran and must respect Congress’s sole constitutional role in the authorization of the use of force.”
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in her statement said the Trump administration “must come before Congress with a detailed plan for how to protect our service members and bases overseas, prevent Iran from restarting their nuclear program, and get Iran back to the negotiating table diplomatically.”
She continued, “I stand ready to work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure we continue to support Israel and keep Americans and our allies safe. But this administration must not push the U.S. into a war with Iran.”
As of Tuesday afternoon, Israel and Iran appeared to be honoring a ceasefire announced by Trump the day prior. However, that shaky status came after a night of bombings from both sides, which drew the ire of Trump.

Patrick Morrisey’s vaccination exemption mandate previously co-sponsored a religious freedom bill that’s being used as the governor’s justification for the order.
On Tuesday, Morrisey held a press conference in Beckley, West Virginia, to announce that a mother had filed a lawsuit against the Raleigh County Board of Education after the state school board recently announced it wouldn’t recognize the governor’s executive order allowing religious exemptions to school immunizations.
The Republican governor says his vaccine executive order is legally permissible under a 2023 bill known as the “Equal Protection for Religion Act” after House of Delegates members lawmakers killed a bill that would have put religious exemptions for childhood vaccinations in state law. 
The lawsuit was assigned to Raleigh County Circuit Court Judge Todd Kirby, who, while serving as a Republican in the House of Delegates, vehemently advocated for the religious freedom bill. 
Kirby joined 10 other Republicans to sponsor the broad bill that says no state action may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion unless it’s essential to a compelling government interest.
While speaking on the House floor, Kirby said that — in his view — the government had infringed on residents’ religious rights, including what was being taught in classrooms. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, he also cited vaccine requirements as an example.
“For people that are very well-educated on the effects of vaccines, both the side effects and benefits, we told them you don’t have a choice; you have to get vaccinated even if it violates your most fervently held religious beliefs,” Kirby said during bill debate. 
Kirby, who has served as judge since 2024, did not respond to an email for this story with questions about whether he should recuse himself from the case. 
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, who was in the House in 2023, raised concerns during bill debate that it would be used to weaken West Virginia’s strict childhood immunization laws. The state has been one of only a handful that hasn’t permitted religious exemptions to school vaccination requirements.
“I have a lot of respect for Judge Kirby, and I expect that he’s going to recuse himself. It’s less of an ask, I expect he’s going to do that because that’s the only thing you can do in this type of situation where he’s voted and advocated for the underlying bill just a couple years ago,” Garcia said on Tuesday.
Garcia said there is precedent that other judges, who served as lawmakers in the House and Senate, recused themselves when case analysis involved legislation they’d voted on.
While a lawmaker, Kirby also co-sponsored a 2024 bill that would have eliminated childhood immunization requirements for private and parochial schools. The bill passed the House and Senate, but former Gov. Jim Justice vetoed the legislation, citing childhood health concerns. 
The West Virginia Democratic Party has also called on Kirby to recuse himself from the case.
“Judge Todd Kirby should recuse himself from hearing this case. As a former member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, he cast a vote and spoke in favor of the so-called ‘Religious Freedom Restoration Act’ — legislation that is central to the legal arguments now before him. That alone should raise serious concerns under the West Virginia Code of Judicial Ethics,” Mike Pushkin, state Democratic Party chair, said in a statement. 
“West Virginians have a right to expect an impartial hearing when it comes to matters affecting the health and safety of their children. Judge Kirby’s continued involvement in this case would violate that principle,” he continued. 
Garcia said he voted against the 2023 religious freedom bill because, “I thought that there was the potential that someone would try to use the law as a weapon to take down the other laws that we’ve had for public safety.”
“I think that Gov. Morrisey has been so aggressive in trying to make a change to the law that he’s really just picking fights wherever he can, and unfortunately for him, he’s losing those fights, and I think he’s going to lose,” he said.
The lawsuit was filed in Raleigh County Circuit Court on behalf of Miranda Guzman, whose child, A.G., was issued an exemption to the school vaccine mandates by the state Department of Health based on religious beliefs. 
More than 100 families have requested to use religious exemption to circumvent vaccine requirements the upcoming school year, according to the state health department. 
Morrisey says the religious freedom bill will supersede the current compulsory school vaccination requirements. 
“In my view, and I think the view of many, many people, this applies to the topic of religious exemptions for vaccines,” he said. “And that 2023 law was passed over any of the conflicting laws.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice have filed a writ of mandamus in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of two parents of immunocompromised students. That lawsuit seeks to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order. 
Kirby, an attorney, served in the House of Delegates beginning in 2022. He resigned from his seat in 2024 after Former Gov. Jim Justice appointed Kirby to serve in the 10th Judicial Circuit. Kirby won his judicial election and will serve an eight-year term that began Jan. 1.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Five words.
That’s the basis on which 20 Democratic attorneys general, including New Jersey’s Matt Platkin, and one state governor, are contesting sweeping cuts to federal grants and aid in a new lawsuit against the Trump administration.
The 80-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday centers on how the Trump administration has interpreted a five-word section of federal regulations to rationalize a “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign,” abruptly terminating billions in already awarded funding to state and local governments, research institutions, universities and more.
The full, 2020 rule promoted by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget states that federal agencies can cut off grants “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” OMB made clear that federal agencies can only terminate grants when there is evidence that the money is not achieving its intended goals or that there is cause to “significantly question” feasibility of achieving the goal.
But Trump’s administration in a Feb. 26 executive order selectively picked five words from the regulation “no longer effectuates…agency priorities” — to justify abrupt cuts to federal aid.
“In effectuating this directive, Agency Defendants now assert—for the first time— that the Clause means something completely new: That the Clause permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind,” the lawsuit states.
Since the initial order authorizing the Department of Government Efficiency to get involved in federal agency grant distributions, the same phrase has featured prominently in subsequent orders, agency memos and explanations for slashing billions of dollars in aid to a wide host of recipients across the country.
“The Trump Administration and DOGE have mounted an unprecedented campaign to terminate billions of dollars of federal funding to states that supports critical programs for our residents. That reckless slash-and-burn campaign has rested on the flimsiest of legal justifications. And it has continued unabated for months — which is why we’re taking the fight to the Trump Administration to stop these reckless and illegal cuts from continuing,” Platkin said in a statement.
The complaint, which names a dozen federal agency heads as defendants, offers a litany of examples of the consequences of abrupt cuts to already awarded federal grants and aid: losing habitat restoration in Maine, ending efforts to combat hate crimes in New Jersey, ceasing shelter programs for migrants in Illinois released from overcrowded federal detention centers and cutting off research of air quality risks from wildfire smoke in rural Nevada.
“With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived States of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more,” the lawsuit states.
Even federal aid still flowing remains at risk, compromising safety and support to people who qualify for food assistance programs and those who live in flood zones, farmers, minority students, scientists, and more, the lawsuit states.
Arguing that the federal administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procuredures Act, the AGs have asked a federal judge to permanently clarify that federal regulations do not grant federal agencies “unfettered power” to terminate funding already awarded. Or, as an alternative, they have asked a judge to toss the Trump administration’s interpretation of the clause in question. The request, if granted, would apply to all existing and future federal grants.

Tate Reeves to halt the execution of Mississippi's oldest and longest-serving death row inmate.,"A prison reform advocate on Tuesday publicly implored Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to halt the impending execution of Richard Jordan, Mississippi’s oldest and longest-serving death row inmate.
“I’m here today to ask our Christian governor to do the Christian thing and show mercy – mercy on a man that has spent 49 years in prison and has done everything he could do to atone for his crime,” Mitzi Magleby said outside the Mississippi Supreme Court.
Jordan, 79, is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection Wednesday evening at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman for the 1976 kidnapping and killing of a woman in coastal Harrison County.

Reeves declined to block the only two executions Mississippi has carried out since he became governor – one in 2021 and one in 2022. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to an email from Mississippi Today on Tuesday seeking comment on Jordan’s case.
Jordan was first convicted in 1976 for kidnapping and killing Edwina Marter in Harrison County, and it took four trials until a death sentence stuck in 1998. 
One of Marter’s sons said Jordan should have been executed long ago.
“I don’t want him to get what he wants,” Eric Marter, who is 59 and lives in Lafayette, Louisiana, told Mississippi Today. “If you want to spend the rest of your life in jail, then I would rather you not get that, and if that means you get executed, you get executed.”

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday denied Jordan’s request for a stay of execution. Jordan had a separate request for a stay awaiting consideration at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The appeals court wrote that Jordan has received repeated review of his claims in state and federal courts for nearly 50 years.
At this point, “finality acquires an added moral dimension,” the appeals court wrote. “Only with an assurance of real finality can the State execute its moral judgment in a case. Only with real finality can the victims of crime move forward knowing the moral judgment will be carried out.”
Magleby, who has met Jordan, said he has been a model prisoner and is extremely remorseful. She said she believes life without parole would be a sufficient and humane punishment. 
“I believe that it is more of a penalty to do life without parole,” she said. “The death penalty gives you an out-date. Life without parole does not.”
She also delivered a petition asking Reeves to prevent Jordan’s execution. That petition had more than 3,000 signatures.

The news conference was put on by Magleby and Death Penalty Action, who are supporters of Jordan’s cause.
If Jordan’s execution goes forward as scheduled, supporters plan to hold protest vigils Wednesday outside Parchman and the Governor’s Mansion and online.
Human rights group Amnesty International released a statement Tuesday opposing the execution.
 “Governor Tate Reeves is the only person with the power to spare Jordan’s life,” the group said. “He must use this power to halt this execution, commute Richard Jordan’s sentence and work towards ending the death penalty in Mississippi more broadly.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24114435/Execution-Protest1.jpg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259
,DC,2025-06-24 21:18:52+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Dems, GOP members of US House panel split on solution to high cost of child care",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dems-gop-members-us-house-panel-split-solution-high-cost-child-care,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats on a U.S. House Education and Workforce subcommittee agreed at a Tuesday hearing that child care affordability was a problem, but proposed different solutions.While Republicans touted a longstanding block grant and called for choice and flexibility in the child care system, Democrats pushed for more federal investments, including legislative efforts that would cap the cost of child care.For just one child, families spend between 8.9% and 16% of the median family income on full-day care, according to Department of Labor data from 2022.“Child care is essential to helping working parents thrive and our local economies grow,” Rep. Kevin Kiley, chair of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education, said at the panel’s hearing.“At the same time, child care can be exceedingly expensive — the cost is only climbing,” said the California Republican, whose panel is part of the House Committee on Education and Workforce.Kiley said the Child Care and Development Block Grant “exists to help working families access affordable child care, giving them the freedom to remain in the workforce and increase their economic opportunity, one solution to the problem of child care affordability and access.”The grant, funded at roughly $8.75 billion in fiscal 2024, goes to states, tribes and territories to help low-income working families access child care.Kiley noted that “choice” is a program pillar, “giving parents the freedom to make both lifestyle and economic decisions that best meet their individual family’s needs.”Caitlin Codella Low, managing director of human capital at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank, noted that annually, “the average cost of child care exceeds $10,000 per child, and it’s more than public college tuition in most states, more than the cost of rent in all 50.”“Employers are paying the price — child care challenges lead to higher absenteeism, lower retention and difficulty recruiting talent,” she added.Local programsTodd Barton, the mayor of Crawfordsville, Indiana, highlighted his community’s efforts in addressing a shortage of affordable, high-quality child care.Barton said that shortage has “deeply affected” the community’s workforce and economic potential.Some of those efforts include the formation of a child care task force that evolved into an early childhood coalition, a full-day summer program for school-aged children and an early learning center that Barton said has already increased the community’s child care capacity by more than 30%.Barton said that “to sustain this scale of work, we need strong federal support,” noting that “programs like the Child Care (and) Development Block Grant and Employer-Provided Child Care Credit are essential tools that we need at our disposal.”Dems blast cutsRep. Suzanne Bonamici, ranking member of the subcommittee, said that “without bold and sustained federal investment, child care costs will continue to rise and the workforce that provides the care will continue to struggle.”The Oregon Democrat blasted the proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as part of congressional Republicans’ reconciliation package.Bonamici described Medicaid and SNAP as “programs that support children, families, child care centers and the child care workforce.”She also highlighted the Child Care for Working Families Act, which Virginia’s Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the full committee, and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, reintroduced in their respective chambers during the previous session of Congress.Bonamici said the bill “would cap the cost of child care at 7% of income, making it affordable for all parents and also provide historic investments in the child care workforce, including higher pay, better benefits and improved training opportunities.”Meanwhile, the Trump administration has made sweeping cuts within the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families.The administration reportedly closed down at least five Office of Head Start regional offices earlier this year.Ruth Friedman, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, said “we are already seeing very bad impacts from those closings.”She added that “local programs are not getting the support and the answers they need, grants are coming slowly to them, which is very, very problematic in Head Start, because they really work month-to-month with their budget and lost an enormous amount of expertise on the local needs those programs serve.”Rep. Summer Lee also called for more federal investment in child care, saying “existing programs are, quite frankly, not cutting it.”“We know that for every dollar we invest in early childhood education, we save substantially more on services that children won’t need as they grow up,” the Pennsylvania Democrat said.She called for passage of the Scott-Murray bill, as well as a measure that would guarantee universal child care access.“This is why we need to pass the Democrats’ legislation like the Child Care for Every Community Act and Child Care for Working Families Act, which I’m looking forward to introducing with Ranking Member Scott in the near future.”",,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

“It’s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,” Neronha said in a statement. “Nearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called ‘agency priorities clause.’ Here, we are proactively asking the Courts to put a stop to the nonsense. The President cannot withhold Congressionally-allocated federal funds from the states, and this clause is no loophole.”
The complaint, which names a dozen federal agency heads as defendants, offers a litany of examples of the consequences of abrupt cuts to already awarded federal grants and aid: losing habitat restoration in Maine, ending efforts to combat hate crimes in New Jersey, ceasing shelter programs for migrants in Illinois released from overcrowded federal detention centers and cutting off research of air quality risks from wildfire smoke in rural Nevada.

Like the state’s first case reported last week, the two additional people who have been infected are adults and unvaccinated, according to a news release issued by the Utah Department of Health and Human services. 
The two additional adults are not linked to each other or the first person who was diagnosed with measles on Friday. They are from different parts of the state, health officials said. One is a Utah County resident, while the other is from the state’s southwest health district. 
“Public health investigations are ongoing to identify any locations where possible exposures may have occurred,” state health officials said. 
First measles case confirmed in Utah amid national outbreaks 

Utahns can monitor the state’s measles case count and find more information about Utah’s response to outbreaks on the state’s website, epi.utah.gov/measles-response/.
As of Tuesday afternoon, the state listed only two potential “exposure locations” and times related to the state’s first confirmed case: Parkway Health Center in Orem, 154 W. 1300 South, from June 13 at 12:30 p.m. to 3 p.m., and Timpanogos Regional Emergency Room in Orem, 750 W. 800 North, from June 14 at 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
State officials are encouraging any unvaccinated people who were at these sites during those time frames to monitor themselves for symptoms, stay away from others and call their health care providers. 
“Call first before you go to a clinic or hospital to prevent other people from exposure,” state officials said. 
Measles symptoms usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure, according to the state health department. Early symptoms include a high fever (higher than 102.2 degrees fahrenheit or 39 degrees celsius), a cough, runny nose or red eyes. A rash typically appears after four days of fever. 
The vast majority of Utahns, more than 90%, have been vaccinated against measles and are “highly protected against infection,” state officials said. However, infants younger than the age of 1 are generally not eligible for the vaccine. 
“These infants are at higher risk of severe disease. If you have an infant younger than age 1 you can talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns and next steps,” state health officials said. “Measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious illness, especially in young children, pregnant women, and people who have weakened immune systems.”
While most Utahns are vaccinated, the state — along with other states in the West — have seen a downward trend in vaccination rates among Utah children in the last five years, Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, told reporters last week. 
Measles outbreak hasn’t hit Utah yet, but health officials are bracing for when it does

“The numbers are still not super low, but they’re low enough to cause us to be concerned that there could be kids who are vulnerable to this, and certainly there are parts of our state or schools that have higher numbers of kids that are not vaccinated,” Nolen said. “So we are concerned that little kids are susceptible to this. There could be an outbreak in a school. So we really would like to encourage people to get them and their children vaccinated.”
Health experts say the most effective protection against measles is the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is 97% effective against measles when a person gets two doses. 
Public health officials want to “reassure the community that immediate action is being taken to contain the situation,” Tuesday’s news release said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice) OKLAHOMA CITY — Hundreds of thousands of people lined city streets, cheering in the confetti-filled air as open-air buses carrying the Oklahoma City Thunder paraded by.
Oklahoma City Police estimated that nearly 500,000 people crammed shoulder-to-shoulder along the nearly two-mile parade route that stretched through downtown to commemorate the Thunder’s first NBA championship since coming to the city in 2008.
They cheered en masse as Thunder players popped champagne and waved at fans.
Maverick Stephenson, of Norman, sat toward the back of the crowd, waiting for the parade to begin. Stephenson, who was covered from the waist up in the Thunder’s trademark blue and orange body paint, said he’s been a longtime Thunder fan.
“I’m really happy,” Stephenson said. “I’ve been a fan for a long time. I was a fan when we were losing a bunch of games, and it feels really good to see your team win.”

He held a handmade poster that read “SGA + DORT Chug A Beer (It’s Canadian),” a reference to Thunder players Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luguentz Dort, who are both from Canada. He said he hoped one of the players would accept the Canadian beer he was holding as they passed by. 
Other fans said they were proud to celebrate their team after finally winning a championship. Some said they had supported the team since they were formerly known as the Seattle SuperSonics and played in Seattle. 
“They overcame a lot of hate and stuck together,” said Makayla Basco, of Mustang. 
She said the team, which is the youngest in nearly 50 years to win an NBA championship, faced a lot of doubt because of their ages and because more people seemed to be rooting for their opponents, the Indiana Pacers. The Thunder beat the Pacers in seven games.
“I was here when Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook almost did it,” Basco said. “Seeing a team that’s just as young as they were to finish it is pretty cool.”
The last time Oklahoma City played in the NBA Finals was in 2012 against the Miami Heat, but they lost that series in five games.















































































































































































Megan Robinson, of Yukon, wore an embroidered Thunder hat and gold lightning earrings to the parade. Robinson said her husband is a diehard Thunder fan. The two have been cheering on the team since the beginning.
“The camaraderie between them is amazing,” she said of the team. “Their teamwork throughout the whole series was amazing.”

Shawn Clay, of Oklahoma City, who was standing with his wife and daughter, attended the parade in a Hawaiian-themed Thunder shirt. His wife and daughter wore Thunder gear and hats.
He said this marked the first time an Oklahoma team has won a major championship, outside of college football, and he wanted to celebrate that accomplishment.
“The team reflects the city, and the city reflects the team we most support,” Clay said.
Adryan Adams, of Oklahoma City, said he’s been a Thunder fan since 2009. He said when he went to college in Texas he often heard people criticize the Thunder.
Now the Thunder has proven that it’s “the best team in the world.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 21:10:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Lawsuit challenges billions of dollars in Trump administration funding cuts,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/24/trump-funding-cuts-lawsuit/,AGs from more than 20 states are seeking to limit Trump administration from relying on an obscure clause to cut grants that don't align with its priorities.,"BOSTON (AP) — Attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C. filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging billions of dollars in funding cuts made by the Trump administration that would fund everything from crime prevention to food security to scientific research.
The lawsuit filed in Boston is asking a judge to limit the Trump administration from relying on an obscure clause in the federal regulation to cut grants that don’t align with its priorities. Since January, the lawsuit argues that the administration has used that clause to cancel entire programs and thousands of grants that had been previously awarded to states and grantees.
“Defendants’ decision to invoke the Clause to terminate grants based on changed agency priorities is unlawful several times over,” the plaintiffs argued. “The rulemaking history of the Clause makes plain that the (Office of Management and Budget) intended for the Clause to permit terminations in only limited circumstances and provides no support for a broad power to terminate grants on a whim based on newly identified agency priorities.”
The lawsuit argues the Trump administration has used the clause for the basis of a “slash-and-burn campaign” to cut federal grants.
“Defendants have terminated thousands of grant awards made to Plaintiffs, pulling the rug out from under the States, and taking away critical federal funding on which States and their residents rely for essential programs,” the lawsuit added.
Rhode Island Attorney General Neronha said this lawsuit was just one of several the coalition of mostly Democratic states have filed over funding cuts. For the most part, they have largely succeeded in a string of legal victories to temporarily halt cuts.
This one, though, may be the broadest challenge to those funding cuts.
“It’s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,” Neronha said in a statement. “Nearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called ‘agency priorities clause.”
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said the lawsuit aimed to stop funding cuts he described as indiscriminate and illegal.
“There is no ‘because I don’t like you’ or ‘because I don’t feel like it anymore’ defunding clause in federal law that allows the President to bypass Congress on a whim,” Tong said in a statement. “Since his first minutes in office, Trump has unilaterally defunded our police, our schools, our healthcare, and more. He can’t do that, and that’s why over and over again we have blocked him in court and won back our funding.”
The lawsuit argues that the OMB promulgated the use of the clause in question to justify the cuts. The clause in question, according to the lawsuit, refers to five words that say federal agents can terminate grants if the award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”
“The Trump Administration has claimed that five words in this Clause—’no longer effectuates . . . agency priorities’—provide federal agencies with virtually unfettered authority to withhold federal funding any time they no longer wish to support the programs for which Congress has appropriated funding,” the lawsuit said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25161592778125-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

As the state’s $3.5 billion road bonding plan runs dry, lawmakers are searching for a new solution to fix the state’s crumbling roads, with Michigan House Republicans advancing a $3.1 billion road funding plan in March with support from several Democrats.
Testifying before the committee on Tuesday, representatives from both the libertarian Reason Foundation and the Michigan County Road Association emphasized that the House’s more than $3 billion plan is a short to medium term solution. 
While Michigan roads are mainly funded through state and federal fuel tax revenue and vehicle registration fees, policymakers have long acknowledged that Michigan is in need of new funding.
The proposal at hand? Mileage-based fees for drivers. 
Both the Reason Foundation and the County Road Association warned that gas tax revenue is on the decline due to electric and hybrid vehicles and the increased efficiency of vehicles powered by gasoline. 
“I like to say the fuel tax is like a rock star on his farewell tour. You know, we keep saying, ‘Well, this is going to be it. We’re going to find a solution. We’re going to find a solution. We’re going to find a solution.’ And we’re to the point now where the rock star has done three or four farewell tours, and we actually need to come up with something,” said Baruch Feigenbaum,  the Reason Foundation’s senior managing director of transportation policy.

The gas tax has lost about 50% of its spending power over the last 30 years due to inflation and a lack of indexing on the tax, Feigenbaum said. 
In its place, Feigenbaum and the other individuals testifying called for a pilot program to examine what it would look like to implement a mileage-based charge on vehicle owners to cover the cost of road repairs in Michigan 
While the state has previously conducted a study looking at road tolls as a potential solution, Feigenbaum argued more will be needed to fix the state’s road funding issues. 
“Tolling by itself is not going to work, because local streets can’t be tolled. [On] roads with traffic signals, tolling is a challenge, and so we need something that can work on all streets in all places,” he said. 
Under this proposal, the Reason Foundation recommends these fees be applied to all vehicles, not just electric or hybrid vehicles. Rates can be flexible and are generally two to three cents per mile depending on the gas tax rate. Additionally, heavy duty vehicles would pay a higher rate as their higher weight means more wear on Michigan’s highways. 
The fees could also be applied in a number of different ways, Feigenbaum said, noting that residents often raise concerns about the government tracking them.

“There is a high-tech option where the device plugs into the vehicle’s OBD2 port and collects the when and the where of highway use. … There’s also a medium option, where you have a device, but it’s only collecting the miles, it’s not looking at the location or the time,” Feigenbaum said. “And then a low-tech option, such as an odometer reading, which can be done with a photo, other types of verification at a mechanic through various inspections that requires very little in the way of new technology and little in the way of new costs.” 
There are also other new options in the works including using a vehicle’s telematics to track location, allowing drivers to pre-pay on mileage, or by using a phone app, Feigenbaum said. 
While some rural residents have raised concerns that this system would cost them more because they have to drive more than residents in urban areas, Feigenbaum noted that drivers in rural areas tend to drive less fuel efficient vehicles, meaning those drivers are paying more in fuel taxes and could benefit from shifting to a mileage-based fee system. 
While Feigenbaum emphasized the mileage based fee should be used as a replacement for the state’s fuel tax rather than a supplement, Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare) asked how the collection costs compared to the 2-3% cost of collecting the fuel tax. In states that had looked into this type of program the cost had been 5-10% of their revenue, Feigenbaum said.
Hosting a pilot program would allow Michigan to examine how this kind of system would work in the state, examining questions like the impact of out-of-state vehicles, options for privacy, and how to best address drivers traveling across multiple states. 
It also allows the state to look into whether they should charge drivers once at the end of the year, or throughout the year, he said.

Ankur Agarwal, the CEO of electronic tolling and road usage charge company GeoToll, offered assurances on the privacy concerns these programs carry, noting that one of the methods using systems integrated with certain newer vehicles only shares data with the consumer’s consent. Even using a GPS method, GeoToll has been able to completely maintain a user’s privacy, he said. 
“So privacy issues were there in the earlier times, but with the recent technology that has been rolled out, the privacy concerns have been completely addressed and they have been eliminated from this road usage charge perspective,” Agarwal said. 
However, Agarwal advised against a GPS plug-in approach, noting that while it is user friendly, it carries a high cost between the device’s hardware, the cost of sending data to a server and maintaining hardware over time.
While Rep. Jennifer Wortz (R-Quincy) asked whether these fees would apply to other vehicles traveling on roads like off-road vehicles, all-terrain vehicles and tractors, the stakeholders emphasized that is the Legislature’s decision to make, should they adopt a mileage-based fee system. 
Should the state pursue a pilot program, Denise Donohue, CEO of the County Road Association, emphasized that the state will first need to educate residents about the impact of these programs, alongside hosting focus groups to gather perspective from residents across the state’s various regions, as they have very different thoughts on these kinds of efforts.

Patrick Morrisey on Tuesday, June 24, 2025, announced his support of a lawsuit against state education officials over their defiance of his religious exemption executive order. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)Calling for “political accountability,” Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Tuesday announced his support of a lawsuit against state school officials over their defiance of his executive order requiring religious exemptions to the state’s school-mandated vaccines.
“These are nine-year terms,” Morrisey said of the school board. ‘That’s a really long time with no political accountability. I would argue that has to change… I am not going to let an unelected body of bureaucrats stop and strip religious liberty protections that are afforded to them under West Virginia law. Period.”
The lawsuit was filed in Raleigh County Circuit Court on behalf of Miranda Guzman, whose child, A.G., was issued an exemption to the school vaccine mandates by the state Department of Health based on religious beliefs. 
Earlier this month, the Board of Education voted unanimously that Superintendent Michele Blatt should issue guidance to the county boards of education that they do not allow religious exemptions for the state’s vaccine laws despite Morrisey’s executive order.
The lawsuit names as defendants members of the state board of education, Blatt and members of the Raleigh County Board of Education. 
Guzman’s lawsuit has been assigned to Raleigh Circuit Judge Todd Kirby. In 2023, Kirby was a member of the state House of Delegates and a co-sponsor of the religious freedom bill that is the basis of Morrisey’s executive order. Kirby was appointed judge by former Gov. Jim Justice in July 2024.
During a news conference in Beckley, West Virginia, Morrisey again argued that the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act should be interpreted as allowing religious exemptions for the state’s school-mandated vaccines. 
“In my view, and I think the view of many, many people, this applies to the topic of religious exemptions for vaccines,” Morrisey said. “And that 2023 law was passed over any of the conflicting laws. We know that there were laws passed on compulsory vaccines many, many years ago. 
“All we did at the beginning of the year, and all we’re doing now as the executive as per his prerogative and discretion, we’re actually stepping up, and we’re interpreting both laws together,” Morrisey said. 
The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the school board so that the student will be able to attend school. It’s at least the second lawsuit to be filed concerning the executive order. The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice has also filed a writ of mandamus in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of two parents of immunocompromised students. That lawsuit seeks to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order. 
Speaking about the new lawsuit Tuesday, Morrisey said filing the complaint was a “very noble thing” for Guzman to do. 
“As a Christian, Miranda is raising a number of objections to state-mandated vaccines that run counter to her deeply held religious beliefs, including the use of fetal cells in some of the immunizations and preemptively altering her daughter’s natural immune system,” he said. “As governor, I fully support Miranda’s ability to seek a religious exemption, and I support her lawsuit against school board bureaucrats.”
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, while some vaccines involve growing viruses in human cell cultures originally developed from two aborted fetuses in the 1960s, vaccines themselves do not contain fetal cells. 
Every state requires children attending school to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases. West Virginia has been one of only five states that allows only medical exemptions for the vaccine requirements.
Morrisey issued his executive order in January. According to the state Department of Health, as of last week, the department had processed 321 religious exemptions for the 2024-2025 school year and 140 religious exemption requests have been processed for the 2025-2026 school year
During the regular session earlier this year, the Legislature rejected Senate Bill 460, which would have put the religious exemptions into state law. The measure passed in the Senate but was voted down in the House of Delegates.
In an email Tuesday, a spokesperson for the state Board of Education reissued a prior statement it previously issued after the board decision not to comply with the governor’s order. 
The board’s direction “is in line with the actions of the West Virginia Legislature during the 2025 regular session which did not vote in favor of religious exemptions for vaccines,” the statement said. “The intent of the state board is to do what is best for the 241,000 children, 23,000 educators and 15,000 service personnel in our 629 public schools. This includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws. This board is constitutionally bound to provide a thorough and efficient system of free schools, and our members remain committed to this charge.”

Steven Jackson sponsored a new law that requires the Louisiana Board of Ethics to broadcast its public meetings. (Allison Allsop)The Louisiana Board of Ethics will be required to broadcast its monthly public meetings starting in January under a new state law. 
The law, sponsored by Rep. Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport, will require the meetings to be available live through internet streaming or television. Recordings of the meetings will be stored for at least two years in an online archive reached through the ethics board’s website. 
The state ethics board oversees the enforcement of political campaign finance laws and the state ethics code for public employees, elected officials and lobbyists for local and state government. Anyone from a public school teacher to the governor can be subject to the board’s investigations. 

The board’s public proceedings mostly deal with fines for not filing political campaign paperwork properly, requests for advisory opinions on ethics laws and charges brought for breaking ethics laws. 

A large portion of the board’s work takes place in private, however, and still won’t be broadcast. 

Who the board votes to investigate for potential ethics violations, for example, is confidential and not released publicly unless the board files charges against someone. Details of allegations against officials over misconduct are also kept secret unless the board brings charges over those accusations. 

Legislators have been frustrated with the ethics board’s decisions over the past year, and part of the motivation for broadcasting its meetings is to allow more scrutiny over its deliberations. 

Jackson, the Shreveport lawmaker who authored the law, has had several disputes with the ethics board after racking up over $10,000 in fines for improperly submitting state ethics paperwork.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Over the past decade, Jackson has accused the board of unfairly targeting him. His accusations were in emails the Illuminator acquired through a public records request last year. 
“You all are nothing more than a debt collection agency that harasses and bullies elected officials who don’t have the means to defend themselves,” Jackson wrote to the board staff in 2022, when he was a Caddo Parish commissioner and before he joined the legislature. 

The broadcast law builds on two other new ethics board statutes Jackson passed last year as a freshman lawmaker. 
One reduced how often elected officials have to file their personal financial disclosure forms with the board. Another dramatically cut the fines lobbyists pay if they submit paperwork late. 
In addition to the broadcast requirement, legislators passed two other bills this year that will make it much harder for the ethics board to charge public servants with misconduct. 

The first bill, sponsored by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, has already been signed into law by Gov. Jeff Landry. It raises the threshold for the board to charge a person with ethical wrongdoing and provides more avenues to the accused for blocking those charges. 
The second, sponsored by Rep. Mark Wright, R-Covington, is on the governor’s desk awaiting his signature. It increases the threshold for charging a person with political campaign finance violations and provides more mechanisms to the accused for pushing back against those charges.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LaIllum-01-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-24 17:09:30.780788

Jim Himes is moving ahead with a war powers resolution.","Amid a tenuous ceasefire in the Middle East and the postponement of classified briefings on Tuesday for federal lawmakers, U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, is moving ahead with his war powers resolution in an attempt to rein in President Donald J. Trump on military action in Iran.
Himes’ push on war powers is part of a larger effort among Democrats to reassert their congressional authority on military action as the Trump administration defends the the president’s ability to launch strikes.
The southwestern Connecticut congressman is part of the “Gang of Eight,” a group of Senate and House leaders plus relevant committee heads in both parties who get briefed on intelligence matters by the administration. But Himes didn’t receive advance notice of the U.S. strike on three Iranian nuclear sites and learned of it through social media. He has since seen some reporting but said he couldn’t discuss it because of its classified nature.
“As the battle damage assessment comes in, based on what I’m seeing out there, I suspect that some of the high-fiving and celebrations are probably going to be revisited in terms of what was actually accomplished,” Himes told the Connecticut Mirror on Tuesday. “I am not confident that this is in fact the end of kinetic activity either by Israel or the United States, so we’re going to continue to go forward” on the resolution.
But he also acknowledged the tough reality of getting enough Republicans to support such a resolution while serving in the minority party. Some Democrats have also been supportive of the strikes, but the vast majority of the party has largely questioned the constitutionality of Trump’s move without input from Congress.
“We’re hoping against hope that maybe there are a handful of Republicans who will remember that their duty is to the Constitution to which they raised their right hand and took an oath, as opposed to the man that occupies the Oval Office,” Himes told NPR on Tuesday.
“That wouldn’t be a terribly good bet, if you are a betting person, but we are going to try to make that case, because again it’s always worth standing up for the prerogatives of the Congress and frankly for the Constitution and the law,” he added.
Himes’ resolution — introduced alongside other national security leaders U.S. Reps. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and Adam Smith, D-Wash. — is similar to other war powers resolutions already introduced, but it has a key distinction: It directs Trump to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in Iran “other than those elements of the Armed Forces that may be necessary to defend the United States or an ally or partner of the United States from imminent attack provided.”
That is on top of a war powers resolution introduced by a bipartisan pair of lawmakers, though one of the sponsors, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., indicated he might withdraw it if the ceasefire holds up. And the Senate has its own version that U.S. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said could come up for a vote later this week.
Once the Himes resolution is formally introduced, a floor vote in the House is required within 15 days. But under House rules, that doesn’t count pro forma session days that happen during a recess, and Congress will be off for a week for the July 4 holiday. That would push the 15-day window farther into July. It is a concurrent resolution, which doesn’t require the signature of a president and is not usually considered binding.
Himes said it was designed as a privileged resolution so that could come up for a vote. 
But House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has been critical of war powers resolutions, saying that it “is not a time for politics.” 
The Constitution grants the legislative branch the ability to “declare war.” The War Powers Act of 1973 requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action if there is no declaration of war. Johnson took aim at that law on Tuesday.
“Many respected constitutional experts argue that the War Powers Act is itself unconstitutional,” Johnson told reporters. “I’m persuaded by that argument. They think it’s a violation of the Article II powers of the commander in chief. I think that’s right.”
Himes and Connecticut’s congressional delegation were hoping to get more answers about the recent strikes on Tuesday during briefings led by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But they were postponed. The Senate briefing was rescheduled for Thursday, and the House one was moved to Friday.
Himes said he didn’t know the reason for the cancellations but cast doubt on Trump’s characterization that Iran’s nuclear facilities were “completely and totally obliterated” based on what the congressman has learned so far.
“Based on what I’ve seen out there in public, not on classified channels, I think the persistent use of the word ‘obliterated’ is probably way misplaced,” Himes said Tuesday.
“It’s very disappointing,” he said about the postponed briefings. “The administration has not only not warned us in advance of this attack but now has cancelled this briefing so they’re being about as untransparent as possible.”
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said Monday he wanted to get more insight into the damage assessment and what officials are doing in terms of “risk mitigation” for U.S. forces in the region. On Monday, Iran launched a retaliatory strike on a U.S. Air Force base in Qatar — which was intercepted by Qatari air defenses.
Since then, Iran and Israel have entered a ceasefire announced by Trump on Monday. But the situation seemed precarious earlier Tuesday. Trump warned both countries against violating the pact and said he was “not happy” with Israel for bombing Iran. 
The president also appeared to walk back his sentiment from a day earlier when he indicated the possibility of backing regime change in Iran.
“I’d like to see everything calm down as quickly as possible,” Trump told reporters Tuesday on Air Force One. “Regime change takes chaos and ideally we don’t want to see so much chaos.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-27-at-5.44.33 PM-1024x567.png,,,2025-06-24 17:09:30.780788

Leslie Rutledge preside over a joint session of the Arkansas House and Senate on Jan. 14, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ political leaders have described feelings of concern and a heightened attention to safety following the murder of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband earlier this month. 
Former Minnesota House Speaker Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed in what Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said appeared to be “a politically motivated assassination.” Law enforcement officers arrested Vance Boelter on June 15. He faces charges for their murders and for shooting Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife who are expected to recover, according to the Minnesota Reformer.
Arkansas House Speaker Rep. Brian Evans, R-Cabot, said he knew Hortman and attended a number of events with her last year.
“It was just a very surreal moment … Just knowing that one of my colleagues, how quickly life could change for one of us,” he said. 
The Advocate spoke to elected officials of both parties, and most said they weren’t afraid for their safety. However, Evans said the act of violence would not and could not be ignored.
“In today’s climate, ensuring safety is not just a precaution, it’s a responsibility,” he said. 
Since the shooting, the addresses for many Arkansas legislators have been removed from the general assembly’s website, as first reported by the Arkansas Times. 
Efforts have been made in recent years to improve security at the Arkansas State Capitol by increasing Capitol Police presence around the grounds and within the complex’s buildings, he said.
Little Rock Republican Sen. Mark Johnson said state lawmakers have security at the Capitol, but once they walk outside, they’re exposed.
“Crazies know no boundaries,” Johnson said. “I have never had any fear for my own safety or that of my family because I’m in the Legislature, but it’s a wake up call that maybe I should just be a little more careful.”
Benton Republican Sen. Kim Hammer said he and other lawmakers have felt safer since the Legislature decided during last year’s fiscal session to have Capitol Police handle security at the Multi-Agency Complex building, Big MAC for short, instead of paid contractors.
Hammer said everyone should condone violent acts, and that he wouldn’t live in fear of potential threats.
“It’s not the first time in history that elected officials have been targeted,” he said. “You go back to when they [Republican Congressmen] were playing ball on a ballfield. They were targeted. You go back to the head of the Democratic Party here in Arkansas. He was murdered.”
A gunman opened fire on Congressional Republicans practicing for a charity baseball game in Virginia in 2017. Democratic Party of Arkansas Chair Bill Gwatney was murdered by a gunman at the state party’s headquarters in 2008.


Let us know what you think...


 

Everyone the Advocate spoke with condemned the shootings, including Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. When contacted for comment, her office pointed to a social media post where Sanders said she was “heartbroken” to hear of what happened. 
“Violence has no place in our democracy,” she wrote. “Bryan and I are praying for the victims and their families.”
Secretary of State Cole Jester’s spokesperson Samantha Boyd said in an email that security was a top priority, and that events such as what happened in Minnesota “certainly intensify concerns and our push for urgency.” At the same time, Boyd said law enforcement was striking a balance between security and public access.
Meanwhile, Jester himself condemned the shootings while touting security funding approved by legislators during the session.
“​​Since the first day I took office, we have been taking action to harden the physical infrastructure of the State Capitol against the kind of despicable actions we saw in Minnesota,” Jester wrote in an emailed statement. “We are thankful to the legislature for giving us funding to do so this spring. Further, we have expanded the State Capitol Police and strengthened their training regimen. Evil is real, and we stand ready to fight back.”
Even with increasing polarization nationally, Evans and other Arkansas legislators highlighted the cordial relationships between lawmakers, regardless of their party affiliation. Those relationships and the example it sets are part of the reason why political polarization has not taken greater root within the state’s legislative body the way it had in other states, they said.
“I do think that more people buy into the lack of civility; they believe that’s just how it is,” Evans said. “You see it a lot with freshman members when they come in now. They’re used to seeing what’s happening on the national news and the national scene, and they think everything’s about a soundbite or whatever.”
A week after political assassination, democracy group tries to chart a way forward

Evans said that most legislators, however, quickly adapt to the body’s dynamics by the end of their first session.
House Minority Leader Rep. Andrew Collins of Little Rock and Senate Minority Leader Sen. Greg Leding of Fayetteville agreed that Arkansas’ Legislature was less polarized than in other states. But the Democrats also expressed greater concern about threats of physical violence against elected officials.
Leding said charged rhetoric from legislators when pushing their bills — especially those framed as “protecting vulnerable kids” — contributes to the problem.
“It could easily plant the idea in someone’s head that there are left-leaning people out there who are targeting children,” he said.
When people interact online, Collins said it seems more extreme than if that same interaction happened in-person. He and other lawmakers from both parties agreed that the conversations surrounding politics were more heated now than before.
“You never know what sends someone into that mindset or into that form of rage that triggers them to take this type of action, as has happened in Minnesota,” Evans said.
Immediately following the assassination, Evans said the House’s security director began a risk assessment. Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said on Friday that those conversations had not yet happened for the Senate. 
Hester said that “crazy people are going to do crazy things” and that once people set their mind to committing violence and are willing to give up their lives to do so, there wasn’t much that could be done.
Leding took issue with this characterization. 
When lawmakers repeatedly demonize vague enemies like “the radical left,” Leding said, it emboldens people to take actions that would otherwise be unthinkable.
“It is deeply irresponsible to just blanket all violence or lay all violence at the feet of people suffering with mental health issues. That is just shrugging off the responsibility of the language we use,” Leding said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer).Kentucky’s utility regulator is inviting Kentuckians to weigh in on the possibilities of developing nuclear power plants in the state.
The Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) in an order earlier this month opened a case to discuss “issues involving the construction, operation, and funding of potential nuclear electric generating facilities.” A PSC press release says the effort is part of complying with a directive from the  Kentucky legislature to make preparations for constructing nuclear power plants.
PSC Chair Angie Hatton in a statement earlier this month said nuclear energy is “increasingly seen as a reliable, dispatchable, clean energy source” as the country faces rising electricity demand. 
“Recent technological advances have made nuclear energy potentially more affordable and attainable,” Hatton said. “However, the technology is still very expensive and we want to make sure we examine all angles of this potential power source, including its impact on ratepayers, electric grid reliability, our environment, economic development and our workforce in Kentucky as we explore our options.” 
In addition to upcoming conferences with utilities in Frankfort, the PSC plans to hold public hearings around the state to hear from Kentuckians given that the “potential impact of nuclear generation and storage on any given community could be significant.” 
Kentucky does not have any nuclear power plants, though Kentucky lawmakers have taken steps to look into the potential for one. Those steps include funding a new research authority at the University of Kentucky. The director of the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research, where the new authority is housed, told lawmakers last year it’s not likely a new nuclear power plant will be built in Kentucky over the next 10 years.
The Public Service Commission regulates the rates and services of over 1,100 utilities that include large, investor-owned electricity providers such as Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, along with small water districts that provide drinking water to rural communities. The regulator also hears requests from utilities to retire or build new power generation and fields complaints from Kentuckians about service and rates.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0218-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 17:09:30.780788

Depart[...]","A view of the Miami Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport from the sky. (Screenshot via Attorney General's X video)Florida’s bid to be on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation plans has taken a swampy turn.
The state, with approval from the Department of Homeland Security, started this week to build a temporary detention center in the Florida Everglades for undocumented immigrants arrested by state police and federal immigration authorities.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media post Monday that the federal government is “working at turbo speed” and the facility will be funded in large part by the FEMA Shelter and Services Program.
Gov. Ron DeSantis is using emergency powers to take control of the facility after his administration offered to buy the land from the county. According to the governor’s office, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava offered what DeSantis’ office called an “unreasonable” price tag for the state to buy the county land, $190 million. 
“Time is of the essence. We must act swiftly to ensure readiness and continuity in our statewide operations to assist the federal government with immigration enforcement,” the Division of Emergency Management wrote in a letter informing the county of the emergency takeover. 
  Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier via Department of Legal Affairs
Florida’s top Democrats blasted the idea initially proposed by Attorney General James Uthmeier, with Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried saying the state is “hijacking” county-owned land.
“This proposed detention center isn’t just cruel, it’s environmentally catastrophic. This facility would desecrate ecologically critical wetlands, trample on Tribal sovereignty, and transform one of the world’s most cherished ecosystems into a prison camp for political gain,” Fried said Tuesday, adding that Uthmeier, a former chief of staff for DeSantis and architect of the Martha’s Vineyard immigrant operation, “is again using human lives as props.”
She wasn’t alone in her criticism, with Democrats in the state House and U.S. House criticizing the move.

Uthmeier first posted about the idea on X June 19. Uthmeier’s post has garnered 291,800 views in the last five days.

— Attorney General James Uthmeier (@AGJamesUthmeier) June 19, 2025

In the video, Uthmeier says DeSantis has tasked state leaders with finding new locations for detention centers and that Miami Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport is the ideal location.
“Because you don’t need to invest that much in the perimeter. People get out, there’s not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons. Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide,” Uthmeier said. He also said the National Guard will be on site. 
The facility occupies 39 square miles and is in the middle of the Florida Everglades. Uthmeier said in his post that as many as 1,000 beds could be brought online in the next 30 to 60 days. 
The Training and Transition Airport initially was constructed in the 1970s as a replacement runway for Miami International Airport but environmental concerns brought continued development to a halt. According to the airport’s website, roughly 900 acres of the 24,960-acre property has been developed. The Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission manages the remainder.
Supporters of mass deportations
Uthmeier and his former boss, DeSantis, have been vocal supporters for the Trump administration’s promise of mass deportations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials and state police raided an apartment complex building site near the Florida State University last month. 
Shortly after Trump’s election, the Florida Legislature met in special session to pass a law that, among other things, makes it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person to enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
DeSantis signed SB 4C on Feb. 13, but U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement temporarily after the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought suit against the state.
Williams on June 17 found Uthmeier in contempt of court for referring to the court’s order blocking the law as illegitimate and unlawful.
Criticisms
FDP Chair Fried wasn’t alone in her criticism of the plan.
  Maxwell Frost via U.S. House
“Donald Trump, his Administration, and his enablers have made one thing brutally clear: they intend to use the power of government to kidnap, brutalize, starve, and harm every single immigrant they can — because they have a deep disdain for immigrants and are using them to scapegoat the serious issues facing working people,” U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost said. 
“They don’t care if people live or die; they only care about cruelty and spectacle,” Frost added. “Anyone who supports this is a disgusting excuse for a human being, let alone a public servant.”
“Florida is too expensive for Floridians, but instead of doing something about it, Attorney General Uthmeier is spending his time on the right-wing podcast circuit trying to go viral — he’s all in,” state Rep. Dan Daley said. 
“Enough with camera-chasing appointees. Florida doesn’t need another politician trying to go viral. We need an Attorney General who will actually do the job,” Daley said. “If Uthmeier can’t, we should find someone who will.”
According to the governor’s office, state use of the facility will be “completely self-contained” and will not involve removing vegetation or permanent construction.

Nation's soaring oil and natural gas production may buffer energy prices if Israel-Iran conflict disrupts global supplies, some industry officials predict.
The post Wyoming oil positioned to weather Middle East conflict, analysts say appeared first on WyoFile .","The global oil market’s reaction to rising conflict in the Middle East has been subdued, so far, as supplies remain flush and shipping routes mostly uninterrupted. That could change, however, if Iran makes good on a threat to shut off the Strait of Hormuz, according to energy analysts.
The key petrol shipping route connects 25% of the world’s oil and about 20% of the world’s liquified natural gas from the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea and on to, mostly, Asian consumers like China. Though speculation abounds about whether Tehran might try and succeed at closing the vital shipping pinchpoint, such an action would most likely send oil prices soaring with implications for Wyoming’s energy-dependent economy.
Yet even if that were to happen, according to market watchers who spoke to WyoFile, the U.S. is far less prone to global supply and price disruptions than in decades past. That’s because the U.S. reversed a 30-year decline in oil and natural gas production to reach record highs, becoming a net exporter of petroleum products in 2020 and surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the top oil producer in the world today.
“We’re way less vulnerable than we’ve been in years past,” Washington D.C.-based Bracewell partner and energy policy analyst Frank Maisano told WyoFile. “We’ve just seen much more minimal impacts [from world oil markets] because we’re inoculated against it — because of all the production we have going in the U.S.”
This map depicts liquefied natural gas terminals in relation to the Strait of Hormuz. (U.S. Energy Information Administration)
The U.S. accounts for about 22% of world oil production, surpassing the second-largest producer Saudi Arabia, which accounts for about 11%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. is also the top natural gas producer, as well as the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.
Following decades of decline beginning in the 1970s, the U.S. regained its foothold in oil and natural gas production, thanks to advances in hydraulic fracturing and onshore directional drilling in the mid-2000s, particularly in shale formations in places like the Permian Basin underlying New Mexico and West Texas.
Though oil prices shot to more than $100 per barrel following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the industry was still on its heels, trying to backfill operations from the COVID-19 pandemic, Maisano noted. Suppliers have regained footing since, and so far world oil prices have oscillated only slightly since the U.S. bombing in Iran. The Brent crude spot price — the benchmark for two-thirds of the global market — slipped by about $5 per barrel to settle around $71 on Monday, according to Reuters. The price remains within the past year’s average.
U.S. oil benchmarks have mostly tracked, with the West Texas Intermediate price briefly up then settling to about $65 per barrel, about $3 less than before the U.S. bombing over the weekend, according to market reports. Though the world market absolutely still influences the U.S. market, Maisano said, it is far less prone than it was 15 years ago.

“There’s always some potential impacts when you talk about conflicts, especially in the Middle East,” Maisano said. “But global markets today are just more resilient compared to where we used to be. It’s because we’ve transformed ourselves into a global energy superpower.”
The situation in the Middle East remains volatile, however, stoking fears of retaliatory efforts by Iran or rogue actors who might want to interrupt shipping routes and tankers.
For now, Wyoming can take solace in robust regional oil and natural gas production, as well as refining capacity, which makes the broader region even more resilient than other parts of the U.S., according to Maisano and others.
Wyoming oil
Pump prices in Wyoming in recent days have tracked slightly lower than the national average of about $3.22 per gallon, according to GasBuddy. And that’s during the onset of the summer travel season.
That’s owed, in part, to regional production and refining capacity.
This map depicts the Rocky Mountain oil and gas producing region. (U.S. Energy Information Administration)
Wyoming is the eighth-largest oil producer in the nation and ranks ninth in natural gas, according to federal data. 
Though its refining capacity of about 126,000 barrels per day is a fraction of the industry’s heyday in the 1970s, the combined production and refining infrastructure in the broader Rockies region supports a relatively stable market, said Grier Bailey, executive director of the Colorado Wyoming Petroleum Marketers Association.
“I think gasoline and fuel supply for Colorado and Wyoming will be okay even if there is a slight increase in the price based on the global commodity exchanges,” Bailey told WyoFile via email. “The U.S., led by states in our [region], have the supply to handle our needs.”
Maisano credits the region’s long history in oil and gas, as well as state leaders throughout the Rockies who are supportive of the industry. 
“You have both Democratic and Republican state leaders who have not been shy about putting domestic production and in-state production as a priority,” he said.
Whatever happens to oil prices related to rising tensions in the Middle East, many producers here still bemoan what they see as Wyoming’s disadvantage — more federal mineral ownership and regulatory hurdles — to be responsive. Producers in New Mexico, West Texas and Pennsylvania can be far more responsive than Wyoming to meet an unexpected spike in demand, said Steve Degenfelder, land manager for Wyoming-based Kirkwood Oil and Gas.
“If you do have a price spike that people want to take advantage of, chances are they’re probably not going to be able to take advantage of it in Wyoming,” Degenfelder told WyoFile.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Some state budget provisions are beginning to come into relief days ahead of a deadline to pass a spending bill before the new fiscal year begins on July 1.
Top-ranking legislators in the Senate introduced tax proposals pitched as part of Murphy’s budget plan that would raise levies on cigarettes and the fluid used in vaping devices.
“Hopefully, some of this revenue will be applied to smoking cessation programs,” Sen. Joe Vitale (D-Middlesex), the chamber’s health chairman and a sponsor of one of the bills, told the New Jersey Monitor.
A bill sponsored by Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the chamber’s budget chair, would nudge New Jersey’s cigarette per-pack tax up from $2.70 to $3, while Vitale’s bill would triple tax rates on electronic cigarette fluid sales at both wholesale and retail levels.
Gov. Phil Murphy pitched both proposals in the budget plan he unveiled in February. They were among a raft of proposed tax increases meant to generate $1.2 billion in additional revenue as New Jersey faces tightening fiscal conditions, a deficit, and uncertainty over the future of its federal funding.
Vitale said a third proposal, which has not been reviewed by the New Jersey Monitor, would apply a 30-cent tax to tobacco-less nicotine pouches, like those sold by Zyn. It was not immediately clear whether the tax would be levied on each pouch or tin. Currently, those products are taxed at 30% of their wholesale price.
The three bills will be combined and advance as one, Vitale said.
“They’re merging everything. All these issues — cigarettes, e-liquid, nicotine pouches — will be merged into one piece of legislation,” he said.
In February budget documents, administration officials urged lawmakers to boost cigarette tax revenue as smoking wanes and is supplanted by newer nicotine delivery mechanisms.
Absent the increase, the tax on cigarettes was expected to generate $365.3 million in the coming fiscal year, down from an estimated $374 million in the current one. With the higher rate, that tax would generate $406.3 million, according to treasury documents.
The increase would allow some money from New Jersey’s cigarette tax, about $10.7 million, to flow into the state’s general fund.
The first $391.5 million in cigarette tax revenue is dedicated to an off-budget fund that pays for smoking cessation and other health care programs, and some additional funds must be used to pay down bonds issued against cigarette tax revenue.
Opponents warned raising the tax would harm convenience stores, gas stations, and other retailers that carry tobacco products.
The changes would push smokers to cross state lines to purchase cigarettes in Pennsylvania, which charges a $2.60-per-pack cigarette tax, said Eric Blomgren, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline, C-Store, and Automotive Association.
“For each individual that does so, there are two losses. One is to the retailer who not only lost that sale, but also the cup of coffee, snack, or other purchase that customer would have also bought,” he said. “The other is to the state, which in an effort to squeeze $3.00 from a pack instead loses the $2.70 it was already getting, plus another roughly 77 cents in lost sales tax.”
Excise taxes like those that New Jersey levies on nicotine products have dual roles. In addition to the revenue they generate, they are meant to deter taxpayers from certain activities, like smoking and drinking.
 Sen. Joe Vitale wants to raise taxes on nicotine products to help raise revenue for the new state budget. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Vitale, a longtime supporter of higher excise taxes on nicotine products, cautioned New Jersey might see limited success on that second prong.
“I think that the revenue’s required, and it serves, at some level, as a disincentive to smoke, but the actual data doesn’t support it as much as I thought it did,” Vitale said. “The people who have an addiction have an addiction. Whether it’s $2.70 a pack or $3 a pack, they’re going to continue to smoke unless there’s an alternative for them.” 
The nicotine taxes are among a range of revenue raisers Murphy has proposed for the next fiscal year. Legislators, including Sarlo, have stated opposition to some others, including a proposal to subject recreational activities like laser tag to the state’s sales tax.
Under Vitale’s proposal, the state’s tax on e-cigarette cartridges would rise from 10 cents to 30 cents per milliliter. That increase would add about 56 cents to a four-pack of Juul cartridges and roughly $1.44 to a four-pack of Vuse Alto cartridges.
New Jersey’s tax on e-cigarette cartridges can be applied to wholesalers or retailers, depending on the flow of goods.
The bill would separately raise the tax rate on bottled vaping fluid to 30% of retail price, from 10%.
It would also require distributors and retailers to take inventory of their stock of vaping fluid, report it to the state, and pay the additional tax within a month of the bill becoming law.
Blomgren argued the state should enforce its existing ban on flavored vaping products before seeking to boost revenue by raising tax rates.
Last year, Attorney General Matt Platkin fined 19 stores for selling illegal flavored vapes. In January, he sent warnings to nearly 11,000 businesses warning of a ban that had by then been on the books for five years.
“It is doubtful that many of the people selling an illegal product are paying the state the proper tax on vape products. In fact, one of our members recently purchased an illegal flavored product from a competitor, and found they did not even charge them sales tax,” Blomgren said.
Murphy and lawmakers must pass and sign an annual spending bill before July 1 to avert a government shutdown.

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) to take a stand against the Republican-led budget reconciliation package, warning of dire consequences for rural North Carolinians.
The press conference, organized by progressive group Down Home North Carolina, featured speakers who shared their experiences with rural education and health care and said the cuts prescribed by President Donald Trump’s proposed “big, beautiful bill” would cause significant harm to both.
The House version of the bill, passed in May, would cut Medicaid funding by nearly $900 billion and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by $295 billion over the next decade, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. Cuts to Medicaid at the federal level could also end North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion, which automatically reverts if federal matching funds fall below a certain threshold.
“We should not argue about whether children eat lunch or not,” said Kim Morrison, the former superintendent of Mount Airy City Schools. “We are a wealthy community as America, and we can take care of those that are less fortunate than us by giving free meals to them and free support for their health.”
Morrison said the federal funding cuts jeopardize not only the wellbeing of those who utilize the programs, but also the financial solvency of rural schools, hospitals, and grocery stores that depend on those dollars. She added that school programs that can easily be taken for granted — like Mount Airy’s student-operated Blue Bear Cafe and summer educational Blue Bear Bus — are made possible in part by federal funding, as are many beloved community programs.
“I think it’s really important for us to educate our community to say rural North Carolina is who’s really going to be hit the hardest,” she added. “They’re going to take the brunt of these cuts.”
Shanna Peele, a Buncombe County special education teacher, said many of her students on individual education plans are able to only because Medicaid covers their expenses. “That means a first grader who can’t hold a pencil gets occupational therapy,” she said. “It means a child learning to walk again can get physical therapy right in their school building. These are not extras. These are necessities.”
Franky Echols, an organizer with Public Schools Strong in Johnston County, noted that the school system is the largest employer in the county, and that many of those jobs will likely lose funding if the “big beautiful bill” passes.

Speakers said they tried to contact Tillis, who is set to seek reelection in 2026, but have been left with murky answers from aides and did not get to hear from the senator directly. Rachel Phipps, a substitute teacher who has two chronic illnesses, lupus and multiple sclerosis, said Tillis’s office did not address her concerns that she could lose access to the care she depends on to continue teaching.
“All the emails I have received that they actually answered, their answer to every question that I asked was they were trying to weed out waste, fraud, and abuse,” Phipps said. “There’s no clear answer. We are not getting direct answers at all.”
In a June 11 commentary for The Hill, Tillis touted the reconciliation package as “the most ambitious welfare reform in a generation” and praised it for “finally enacting work requirements for able-bodied adults.”
“Trump was right to push to protect Medicaid beneficiaries while calling for a crackdown on waste, fraud and abuse,” Tillis wrote. “How dare we expect an able-bodied adult capable of holding a job actively seek employment, volunteer in their community, or pursue education in exchange for taxpayer-funded benefits?”
Todd Warren, a former public school Spanish teacher who is now Down Home NC’s statewide education strategist, said Tillis is “missing” as his constituents seek answers on the bill, adding that concerns about waste, fraud, and abuse are an attempt to deflect the fears of those who will lose coverage under the changes.
“There’s just literally no way to make that level of cuts and people not lose health care and access to food resources,” Warren said. “If there is any waste, fraud, and abuse, it’s on the part of the insurance companies, and that should be returned to the people of North Carolina.”
The Senate is expected to vote on the budget mega-bill on Friday or Saturday, after which it would proceed to the House for a final vote before heading to Trump’s desk if both votes are successful.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/uscapitolmiranda_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 17:09:30.780788
,California,2025-06-24 20:22:51+00:00,CalMatters,Sacramento police release search warrant in California senator’s DUI investigation,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/sabrina-cervantes-dui-warrant/,CalMatters obtained the search warrant from Sen. Sabrina Cervantes’ DUI investigation. Here’s what it says.,"In summary
CalMatters obtained the search warrant from Sen. Sabrina Cervantes’ DUI investigation. Here’s what it says. 


A California state senator had thick slurred speech, appeared drowsy and was unsteady on her feet when officers interacted with her at a Sacramento hospital following a car crash last month, according to a search warrant a judge signed authorizing police to perform a DUI blood test.
Sen. Sabrina Cervantes’ blood would later show no evidence of intoxicating substances, and Sacramento County prosecutors declined to file charges. 
Now, Cervantes is threatening to sue the Sacramento Police Department, alleging officers targeted the Democrat representing Riverside because of her race and sexual orientation. 
Her attorney, James Quadra, said the search warrant CalMatters obtained late Monday from Sacramento police through a California Public Records Act request only helps their case. 
“There’s going to be lots of witnesses that are going to contradict everything that this officer put in there under oath,” Quadra said today.
But on May 19, the day of the crash, Officer Kevin Lucas was able to persuade a deputy district attorney and a Sacramento Superior Court judge that officers had probable cause to believe Cervantes, 37, was impaired by a central nervous system depressant, according to the search warrant. 
Cervantes was cited under a California statute that prohibits driving under the influence of “any drug.” That includes prescription or even over-the-counter medications.
The document, which includes Lucas’ sworn affidavit, is the first police record released in the case. The police department has so far declined to provide CalMatters with body camera footage or other reports. Officers cited the other driver for running a stop sign and prosecutors cleared Cervantes. Police have said the crash remains under investigation.
Lucas wrote in his affidavit that officers met Cervantes at a Sacramento hospital emergency room following the early afternoon crash a few blocks from the Capitol. 
Last month, police said the state fleet vehicle manager called to report the collision and that Cervantes’ chief of staff drove her to the hospital. 
Warrant alleges Cervantes appeared intoxicated
When officers arrived, they met with Cervantes in the emergency room waiting area. Lucas wrote that Cervantes was seated and wearing a black face mask and sunglasses.Lucas wrote that Cervantes “appeared to have difficulty getting into a standing position,” and she had an “unsteady gait” as she walked the 75 feet to a private security room.
“When she removed her face mask and sunglasses she appeared to be drowsy while speaking,” Lucas wrote. Cervantes had “thick slurred speech and at times she stumbled over the pronunciation of words during her statement.”
She denied drinking anything, but when officers asked to perform field sobriety tests, she declined and said “she would need to speak with senate legal counsel first,” Lucas wrote. 
Officers suspected this was a “stalling tactic attempting to delay the investigation of DUI,” Lucas wrote. Cervantes told officers she wouldn’t provide a blood sample unless police obtained a search warrant, Lucas said. 
A deputy district attorney reviewed the documents before Judge Carlton Davis signed it at 5:41 p.m., more than four hours after the crash. 
Police would later tell reporters that Cervantes eventually consented to the blood test before the warrant was authorized, but they decided to wait until they had the judge’s clearance before taking a blood sample. 
Cervantes’ attorney claims officers lied
“The officers remained professional throughout, taking time to explain the process and answer all of the senator’s questions,” police said in a statement last month.
Quadra, Cervantes’ attorney, said it was no wonder that his client was unsteady on her feet. She had just been in a wreck that totaled her car. She also had spoken to a legislative law enforcement officer who advised her to go to the hospital to get checked out, he said. 
Once she got there, police started treating her “as if she did something wrong when she’s a victim,” Quadra said. He added that given their suspicion, it was little wonder she exercised her right to seek legal advice. Quadra said no one else Cervantes spoke to that day noted she had slurred speech.
“I don’t fault the judge for issuing a warrant when a police officer lies,” Quadra said. “And that (search warrant is) full of lies.”
Sacramento police spokesperson Sgt. Dan Wiseman declined to comment.  
Ed Obayashi, a law enforcement officer, lawyer and consultant who gives state-certified training courses to police, including on how to prepare search warrants, reviewed Lucas’ affidavit at CalMatters’ request. 
He said it wasn’t the strongest affidavit he’s seen, but it meets the “minimum threshold” of probable cause. Obayashi noted that both a prosecutor and a judge felt the same. 
He said he could see no evidence in the document that police officers were biased against Cervantes. They may have noted her Hispanic ethnicity in the report, as is standard police practice, but officers would have had no idea she was a member of LGBTQ community, Obayashi said. 
“I mean, does she have a sign around her neck saying that?” he said. “How would they know?”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/042423-Assembly-Floor-0424-MG-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-24 17:09:30.780788

(Screenshot from the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma Supreme Court justices on Tuesday questioned the timing of the state Republican Party’s challenge of a proposed ballot measure that could open primary elections.
The state’s highest court heard about an hour and a half of oral arguments from both supporters and opponents regarding State Question 836, which proposes overhauling the state’s primary election system. Justices did not immediately issue a ruling. 
Vice Chief Justice Dana Kuehn said the Oklahoma Constitution places all political power with the people of the state and that the court has affirmed that it will not violate this provision by dictating what the people get to put on the ballot except in rare occasions. 
“There’s no tension until it’s a law or a constitutional change that then someone challenges and brings to us, and then we decide,” she said. “We don’t even know if they’re going to get enough signatures. We don’t know if the gist is okay. We don’t know any of those things. And I just want to understand why you think we should be here right now.”
  Benjamin Sisney argued against a ballot measure to open primary elections in Oklahoma in front of the state Supreme Court on Tuesday. (Screenshot from the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network)
But Benjamin Sisney, an attorney representing the Oklahoma Republican Party and Ronda Vuillemont-Smith, a former Tulsa GOP chair, who are challenging the measure, argued that the challenge is not premature. He said if the question is allowed to proceed, it would make “radical” changes to state elections. Sisney also questioned the constitutionality of opening the state’s closed primary system to any registered voter.
“It creates the false appearance that candidates are endorsed by or affiliated with the party, co-opting or appropriating the party’s name and platform,” Sisney said. “This is what clearly, manifestly violates the Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has consistently protected the associational rights of political parties.”
The proposed state question, which needs nearly 173,000 signatures to make it onto a future ballot, seeks to open primary elections to all voters. Voters would choose one candidate for each office and the top two voter-getters advance to the general election regardless of political party. Presidential primary elections would be unaffected. 
While Oklahoma primaries are currently closed, parties can choose to open them to 466,000 registered independent voters. Only Democrats currently do. 
Supporters argue that opening the primaries will allow more people to participate in elections, which are often decided in a primary or primary runoffs.
They argued Tuesday that the state question doesn’t affect the First Amendment rights of political parties at all.
  Robert McCampbell argued on behalf of proponents of the ballot measure on Tuesday. (Screenshot from the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network)
Open primaries would not change the way political campaigns are run or how political parties can support candidates, said Robert McCampbell, counsel for the state question proponents. 
“They can run their process however they want, and they can run their process with whatever rules they want,” he said. “They keep all of their First Amendment rights. Mr. Sisney says, ‘Well, what about a Trojan horse candidate?’ Somebody files to be a candidate for a party, but they’re not a true believer for that party? Well, that can happen under our current system.”
Voters would not be selecting nominees for a political party under open primaries, McCampbell said, but for candidates to advance to a general election. 
Tony Stobbe, a proponent for the ballot measure and respondent in the lawsuit, said in a statement following Tuesday’s arguments that this is not a partisan issue. 
“Let the people vote,” he said. “That’s all we’re asking. The only reason party insiders are trying to block SQ 836 in court is because they know it has real momentum. Oklahomans are ready for a system where every voter gets to vote in every election — and the political elites are clearly scared of that.”
A spokesperson for the plaintiffs’ counsel declined to comment further on the case. 
Justice Travis Jett recused himself from this case. He was sworn in Monday after being appointed in April. 
Judge Robert Bell from the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals was appointed as a special justice for this case.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Three years after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal right to an abortion, health care organizations in Maine are sounding the alarm about dire federal funding cuts impacting family planning providers, and the need for the state to step in.
Maine’s reproductive health providers, Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning, have already been cut off from funding through Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services, without explanation, they said. 
If the budget reconciliation bill currently being debated in the U.S. Senate is to pass, patients on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, would no longer be covered for health care provided by organizations that receive more than $1 million in federal reimbursements and also provide abortions.
“Every single day we are having to navigate a new policy or push from the federal government, something that’s being taken away, all in an attempt to put us out of business, to stop us from providing abortion,” Nicole Clegg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said at a press conference on Tuesday.
During the virtual event, patients also highlighted the importance of reproductive freedom. 
Years ago, Portland resident Aleisha Reynolds was 20-years-old, in an abusive relationship, and in want of an abortion. She said she worked several jobs to scrape together the funds and ultimately said it changed her life for the better. Reynolds eventually began advocating for abortion rights, which she believes are fundamental. 
“I can’t imagine where I would be if I had been denied an abortion,” Reynolds said. 
“I’m horrified to think of all the people who have been denied that decision, both before and after the Dobbs ruling,” she added, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in 2022 that struck down the federal right to abortion granted by Roe v. Wade.  
Clegg and others stressed that, since the organizations are committed to serving patients regardless of their ability to pay, these pending cuts would ultimately mean their clinics may need to further reduce hours or staff, unless that funding can be found elsewhere.
“We need Maine legislators to step up and fill the void,” said Maine Family Planning President and CEO George Hill.
The budget addition signed by Gov. Janet Mills on Monday includes $3 million for family planning services, such as routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. This amount is half of what providers requested in a bill this year, which is currently vying for remaining funds in the budget committee. 
Hill emphasized that the rest of the money needs to be allocated to cover services that both providers are committed to providing. 
Already, some Maine Family Planning locations in rural areas including Rumford, Damariscotta and Dexter can only stay open once or twice a week because of the persistent deficits these centers have been facing. The targeted exclusion from Medicaid funding, which 47% of all Maine Family Planning patients used last year, further jeopardizes the services they can provide, according to Olivia Pennington, director of advocacy and community engagement for the organization.
Medicaid funding already can’t be used for abortion, but Clegg said the budget reconciliation bill was “a backdoor abortion ban.” 
“In Maine, we are fortunate that our state laws protect the right to abortion, but these rights mean nothing without access to care,” she said. “And right now we are facing, at state and federal levels, insufficient funding, withheld funding, and an otherwise all out assault on reproductive health care by anti-abortion politicians.”

Buck Newton --seen here in a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting last week -- has reworked a House Bill intended to protect people from sexual exploitation to one that targets transgender surgery and access to public school library books. (Photo: NCGA video stream) The North Carolina Senate voted Tuesday to approve a controversial bill that defines biological sex and recognizes only male and female genders, mirroring one of President Donald Trump’s earliest executive orders.
“We cannot ignore the biological realities,” Sen. Buck Newton told the Senate chamber in Tuesday’s floor debate.
House Bill 805 started as a noncontroversial measure to prevent the sexual exploitation of both adults and minors. It passed the House in May 113-0. In recent weeks, however, Senate Republicans transformed it into a catchall for a collection of conservative social agenda priorities, including provisions that target transgender individuals and provide parents with expanded rights to challenge school library books.
The vote on the bill, which was 27-4, precipitated a lengthy and intense debate about Senate rules and an additional series of procedural votes. Most Democratic senators said that they chose to vote “present” on the matter because of their objection to the way a consensus bill was amended with items they argue were not germane to the original subject and therefore in violation of Senate rules.
As the Senate voting machines do not include an option for members to vote “present” like many other legislative bodies, however, Senate Republicans responded by moving to treat the “present” voters as if they were excused from voting — a status they argued would bar those members from taking any further votes on the bill if it were to come again before the Senate.
At one point, citing an 18th Century law that purported to impose a fine of $10 on lawmakers who fail to carry out their duties, Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch of Wake County offered to make a payment of cash for each of her members who voted “present.”
In the end, Senate Rules Chair Bill Rabon (R-Brunswick, Columbus and New Hanover) used a procedural move to advance the bill to its third reading where it was approved on a voice vote — thus diffusing the controversy.
During the debate on the original vote, Senator Batch said the bill that was written to protect children was “hijacked, gutted” and loaded up with culture war amendments.
Newton responded by offering yet another amendment that would prohibit public school students from sharing sleeping quarters with a member of the other biological sex during field trips or school sponsored events. The amendment was approved on a partisan vote.
Democratic amendments that would have raised the age to marry to 18, appropriated more funds for the state victims’ compensation fund, and required the surrender of a firearm upon the issuance of a domestic violence protective order were rejected by the Republican majority. Republicans also defeated a motion by Sen. Kandie Smith (D-Edgecombe, Pitt) that would have divided the bill into two different sections so that she and her colleagues would have been enabled to vote in favor of the bill’s noncontroversial provisions.
The Senate’s version of HB 805 would ban the use of state funds for transgender surgeries for any prisoner incarcerated in the state correction system.
The statute of limitations on medical malpractice lawsuits brought by people who have undergone a gender transition procedure would be extended from three years to ten. The legislation would also require that the original birth certificate be preserved at the state and county whenever a transgender person seeks to have their gender changed on that legal document.
The original portion of the bill, which won unanimous support in the House, enacts guardrails for online pornography. It creates age verification and consent requirements for individuals appearing in pornographic images, provides for the removal of those images, and create enforcement mechanisms. The Attorney General would be empowered to impose a fine of up to $10,000 a day for each day a pornographic image remains online when non-consensual content is not removed after 72-hours of being notified.
HB 805 was further amended last week to excuse students from specific classroom discussions, activities or assigned readings that the student, parent, or guardian believes would impose a substantial burden on the student’s religious beliefs. Parents would also have access to a searchable list of school library books, with the power to mandate which library books may not be borrowed by the student.
The North Carolina Values Coalition said the bill attempts to solve “the obscenity problem in our schools” related to curriculum and library books. The ACLU of North Carolina said the legislation amounts to harmful attacks on transgender people, and a desire to push them out of public life.

The board has charged the Iowa-licensed compounding pharmacy FarmaKeio, located in Richardson, Texas, with violating provisions of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. The board has not disclosed the specific nature of the violations or stated when they occurred.
However, in April 2022, the Food and Drug Administration publicly warned patients and medical providers to refrain from using any FarmaKeio products that were intended to be sterile.
The warning followed an FDA inspection of FarmaKeio facilities in which regulators claimed to have “observed conditions that could cause the drugs produced by the company to become contaminated or otherwise pose risks to patients.” The FDA recommended the company voluntarily recall certain products.
The FDA also advised health care professionals to check their medical supplies, quarantine any FarmaKeio drugs that were intended to be sterile, and not administer them to patients.
A hearing on the Iowa Board of Pharmacy charge is scheduled for July 18, 2025.
In a separate matter, FarmaKeio currently facing charges from the California Board of Pharmacy. The board’s executive director alleges FarmaKeio provided false information to board investigators in an effort to subvert a board investigation; committed unprofessional conduct by shipping 92 prescriptions for compounded hormonal pellets to California that were obtained from a facility not licensed in California; furnished patients with compounded drug preparations that were adulterated; and provided compounded drugs in violation of FDA restrictions.
In that case, the California board’s executive director is seeking to revoke FarmaKeio’s nonresident compounding pharmacy license and to bar the company’s chief executive officer, Daniel Deneui, from serving as a manager, administrator, officer or partner for five years if the company’s license is placed on probation.

(Image courtesy U.S. Forest Service)The U.S. Senate parliamentarian ruled late Monday that a provision by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to mandate the sale of more than 2 million acres of federal public land cannot be part of the Big Beautiful Bill.
Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough — the official nonpartisan advisor to the Senate who interprets the body’s rules — ruled that several provisions in the major spending bill violate the Byrd Rule, which constrains what measures can be part of reconciliation bills and pass with a simple majority. Typically, votes in the U.S. Senate must overcome the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster. According to the Economic Policy Innovation Center, the Byrd Rule requires reconciliation bills to be focused on fiscal issues.
A press release by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resource Committee, said that the ruling indicated seven provisions that are subject to the Byrd Rule, including requiring the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to sell off swath of public land in 11 state. Montana is exempt from the provision.
The other provisions ruled against by MacDonough include sections about energy leasing, fees, royalties and exports, as well as one that would nullify environmental reviews for offshore oil and gas projects.
On social media, Lee, who chairs the Natural Resource Committee, indicated he would continue to push for selling some public land to help address housing issues in the country. He did announce his intention to make some changes to his provision including removing all Forest Service land from consideration and reducing eligible BLM land to only land within five miles of a population center.
Montana’s federal delegation has come out strongly against the sale of any public lands, and Montana is the only Western state that was exempt from Lee’s proposal.
Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke was successful in removing a public lands sale provision from the spending bill before it passed the House, and subsequently founded a Public Lands Caucus, which Montana Rep. Troy Downing joined.
Sen. Steve Daines also issued a strong rebuke against selling federal land, with a spokesperson telling the Daily Montanan that Daines “always has and always will be against the sale of public lands.”

BURLINGTON — A defense attorney for a person linked to the fatal shooting of a U.S. border patrol agent in Vermont earlier this year anticipates his client will soon face charges that carry the death penalty.
That comment from federal public defender Steven Barth, who represents 21-year-old Teresa Youngblut, was made Tuesday afternoon during a hearing in U.S. District Court in Burlington.
Barth said he expected federal death penalty eligible charges would be brought against Youngblut in “short order.” He did not elaborate on the charges during the hearing and declined to speak to reporters following the proceeding.

“You all have a good day,” he said to reporters as he walked away. 
Acting U.S. Attorney for Vermont Michael Drescher, the top federal prosecutor in the state, declined comment following the hearing Tuesday afternoon. 
Youngblut and Felix Bauckholt were stopped in January by federal agents on Interstate 91 in Coventry, which led to a shootout that left Bauckholt, a German national, and Border Patrol agent David “Chris” Maland dead.
Youngblut has since been charged with two federal offenses. One charge alleged that Youngblut “used a firearm while knowingly assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating, and interfering with a U.S. Border Patrol Agent while he was engaged in official duties.” 
The second charge stated that Youngblut “knowingly carried, brandished and discharged a firearm” during a violent crime. Youngblut pleaded not guilty to the charges in February and has been held without bail. 
Youngblut has not been directly charged with firing the fatal shot that killed Maland. 
In a document released in May titled, “Summary of Incident: Border Patrol Agent and subject killed during vehicle stop in Vermont,” the U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated that Youngblut fired a shot during the incident and struck a Border Patrol agent. However, the report does not explicitly state who fired the shot that killed Maland.
Youngblut and Bauckholt allegedly had ties to a loosely connected group of people known as the “Zizians,” an offshoot of the Rationalist movement that has been tied to several other homicides, including in California and Pennsylvania.
Another person linked to that group, Maximilian Snyder, was arrested in the Jan. 17 homicide of a Vallejo, California, landlord. Snyder and Youngblut had previously applied for a marriage certificate in Washington, where they both resided in the past.
VTDigger is using Youngblut, Bauckholt and Snyder’s names as they appear in court documents. While all three people have appeared to use other names in some instances, VTDigger has not been able to confirm which each person uses in their day-to-day lives.

The change at the top of Keolis Commuter Services comes as the contract, held by the company since July 2014, is set to expire June 2027.
The post MBTA commuter rail operator’s CEO heads back to France  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ABDELLAH CHAJAI, the CEO and general manager of the MBTA’s contracted commuter rail operator Keolis Commuter Services, is leaving his position this summer and returning to France. In September, he will start a new job as executive director of marketing and innovation for the Keolis Group, a Paris-based conglomerate focused on public transportation. 
The change at the top of Keolis Commuter Services comes as the contract, held by the company since July 2014, is set to expire June 2027. MBTA officials are readying to have a new contract in place, whether it’s with Keolis or another operator, by the time the current contract expires. 
A search for Chajai’s successor is underway, according to the company. An interim CEO, not yet announced, will helm the organization until the new CEO is hired, with input from MBTA officials. 
Chajai, a native of France, first took the CEO job in 2022. He relocated from London, where he worked for a joint venture involving Keolis and fellow operating company Amey, an engineering and operations firm. 
“I am tremendously proud of what the Keolis team has accomplished during my time in Boston, and in my new role I will continue to be a champion for the important work happening here,” he said in a statement. “In partnership with the MBTA, we have helped usher in a new era of Commuter Rail operations and service, driving the strongest ridership return nationally post-Covid.” 
Brad Thomas, the president and CEO of Keolis North America, the subsidiary of Keolis Group that owns Keolis Commuter Service, thanked Chajai for his work in Boston. “Keolis is committed to continuing this momentum and to bringing a new CEO to lead Keolis Commuter Services into the future,” he added. 
Keolis Commuter Services, one of the largest private employers in the area, has 2,500 people on the payroll, with 85 percent of the workforce represented by 14 unions. As part of its contract with the MBTA, the company received $421 million in 2023 for train operations, as well as $83 million for additional work and $19 million in revenue-sharing and parking. 
The commuter rail system has just over 140 stations and an on-time performance rate of 92 percent, according to the MBTA. The system, which runs out to Worcester, as well as New Bedford and Fall River, sees more than 550,000 weekly passengers. 
The Fall River/New Bedford Line, also known as South Coast Rail, a long-awaited project that cost $1.1 billion, started service on March 24. 
But the service saw a rocky start, with canceled trains and customers shifted onto buses. Keolis blamed cancellations on needing more trained employees, and Chajai appeared before the MBTA’s oversight board in April to apologize to passengers for the disruptions. 
In a May 2 letter to state senators last May, after they inquired about the late trains, MBTA general manager Phil Eng wrote that, while the majority of South Coast rail trips were on time, the shuttle service was “entirely unacceptable.”  
“Keolis provided assurances to the MBTA prior to the start of service that a sufficient number of trained operators would be available, and that Keolis would provide the level of service our riders deserve,” he added. “Keolis has fallen short on that promise, and the MBTA intends to hold Keolis accountable.” 
That aside, the head of the MBTA’s watchdog agency praised Chajai’s three years as CEO. Brian Kane, the executive director of the watchdog MBTA Advisory Board, credited him with increasing revenue collection with the installation of fare gates at North Station. The fare gates are soon coming to South Station, too. 
“I think he had a successful tenure,” Kane said.

You can read more about the section here.

Mississippi’s public school teachers and students keep racking up wins for our state.
A few months ago, we received terrific news regarding the latest national test scores. Our fourth-graders earned a ninth-in-the-nation overall ranking in reading and 16th place in math. Mississippi students did similarly well on state tests, achieving the highest proficiency rates ever logged on those assessments.
The recently released Annie E. Casey Foundation’s KIDS COUNT 2025 Data Book now ranks Mississippi 16th in the nation for education — an incredible leap from 30th in 2024 and 32nd in 2023.
National media outlets have proclaimed our students’ remarkable rise in academic proficiency to be the “Mississippi Miracle,” inspiring other states’ education leaders to ask how they can be more like us.
Without a doubt, the progress made in Mississippi’s public schools is a direct result of the tireless efforts of our public school teachers and students. Their impressive work has been bolstered by tens of thousands of parents and community leaders who have been standing in the gap for decades, fighting for better school resources and, importantly, against the billionaire-backed campaign to undermine public education through private school voucher programs.
Other states have fallen victim to the voucher lobby, swayed by the millions of dollars spent pressuring them to adopt so-called “school choice” policies. Mississippi’s legislators, however, have resisted school choice, standing with their constituents and refusing to gamble with our children’s futures, thereby avoiding the financial and academic pitfalls suffered in states that embraced voucher schemes.

But a piece of legislation moving through Congress poses a significant threat to our state’s education progress. 
The sweeping federal budget bill, HR 1 (the One Big Beautiful Bill Act), includes a dangerous provision that would impose a nationwide tax-credit voucher program, overriding the will of states like Mississippi and threatening our historic progress. 
These few paragraphs tucked into a massive federal budget bill would jeopardize the gains our students have worked so hard to achieve while adding $5 billion a year to the federal deficit.
Mississippi isn’t alone in opposing school choice schemes. Voters across the country have rejected voucher proposals every single time they’ve appeared on statewide ballots. Unfortunately, some state legislatures have ignored their constituents in favor of voucher lobbyists and donors, legislating voucher programs with devastating consequences: severe state budget shortfalls and flagging student achievement. In fact, every state named by EdChoice as a “Top 10 School Choice State” has seen academic performance decline precipitously while Mississippi’s results keep rising.
If HR 1 were to become law with the voucher provision intact, it would set Mississippi back decades and establish a dangerous precedent: allowing private interests to decide which of the country’s children will be educated with federal dollars.
The bill already has passed the House and now awaits action in the Senate where Mississippi’s own senators —  Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith — could play a critical role in removing the tax-credit voucher language from the legislation. Both senators enjoy significant influence in the U.S. Senate, influence that is heightened in this case by what is expected to be a very close vote. 
We urge them to consider these key points:

Mississippians have rejected vouchers time and again and do not want them forced on us by the federal government.
The tax-credit voucher plan in HR 1 would reverse years of progress in our public schools.
The proposed tax-credit voucher program would add $5 billion to the federal deficit annually — for a program Mississippians don’t want.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)Two Kentucky lawmakers are hoping to revive bills in the next legislative session that did not pass through the General Assembly before. 
Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, and Rep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, spoke about their bills in front of the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government Tuesday morning. Elkins’ proposal would allow cremation or burials of unclaimed dead bodies, but it died in the House earlier this year. Roarx’s bill would allow local code enforcement and zoning inspection employees in Louisville to be eligible for hazardous duty retirement. It did not get a committee hearing this year, but was backed by a few Democratic representatives and Republican House Whip Jason Nemes, of Louisville. 
  Greg Elkins, R-Winchester. (Kentucky Senate Majority Caucus)
Elkins said his bill is a “local control bill” that gives local governments in the state the option of cremating or burying dead bodies in cases where a family member cannot be found. The decision to cremate or bury would be made by the local coroner, fiscal court, consolidated local government or urban-county government that would be responsible for the expense. 
One amendment to the bill this year was to direct coroners to search for next of kin for at least six months, but some coroners in rural areas had argued that was too long and storage costs could incur to local governments, Elkins said. Next year’s bill will likely make  the time frame 30 days. 
Another amendment addressed avoiding cremation if the person was Jewish to align with common practices in the religion. Elkins said that Rabbi Shlomo Litvin of Chabad of the Bluegrass offered to cover costs of the burial for persons of Jewish descent who might be affected by the local government decision. 
Elkins said the 2026 session would mark the third time he’s filed the legislation. 
“Each time it has made it further and further, so I’m hoping this year it gets all the way across the line,” the senator said. 
Roarx presented her bill to the committee with Brandon Lincoln, the chair of governmental affairs for the Kentucky State Fraternal Order of Police. She said the bill would make Louisville Metro code enforcement officers eligible for hazardous duty retirement benefits. Those employees are often involved in situations that include investigations, inspections, issuing citations and more that have “a high degree of peril and danger as well as physical conditioning.” Clerical and administrative positions are not included in the bill.
  Rachel Roarx (LRC Public Information)
Lincoln told lawmakers that code enforcement officers, particularly in Louisville, are “frequently (the) first point of contact in the efforts to resolve serious issues with property owners and or tenants.” Some properties also have hazardous environments, such as unsafe living conditions or unreported occupants. 
Roarx said that about 60 Louisville Metro employees would be eligible for benefits under her bill and that the additional expense would be under $500,000 annually. 
“It’s a pretty reasonable financial investment that only the City of Louisville would have the option to take on if they so choose in the next budget sessions that they encounter,” Roarx said.

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/Source New Mexico)The U.S. Forest Service will seek to repeal a rule that has effectively blocked the logging of almost a third of America’s national forests, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins told a meeting of Western governors on Monday in New Mexico.
The “Roadless Rule” has blocked the construction of new roads in wild areas of most states’ national forests since 2001, when it was imposed in the closing days of President Bill Clinton’s presidency.
“In this administration, we are taking a look under the hood of each and every regulation that affects the everyday lives of the American people, and this rule certainly affects the everyday lives of every single American living in the American West,” Rollins told officials assembled at the Western Governors Association meeting.
“That’s why I’m excited to announce today here with you, for the first time, our intent to repeal the disastrous Roadless Rule. The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests under the leadership of President Trump,” she said.
Lifting the rule would allow the construction of roads, a needed prerequisite for development and logging, in significant parts of the Tongass National Forest, the largest remaining temperate rainforest on Earth. Ninety-two percent of the Tongass is considered a roadless area.
“There’s no doubt about it, we are continuing to be aggressive in our efforts to increase American timber production in line with President Trump’s agenda,” Rollins said.
Rollins’ announcement was criticized by environmental groups, who vowed to oppose it.
“Secretary Rollins is taking a blowtorch to a landmark rule that shields almost 60 million acres of national forests from the serious impacts roads can have, not only on wildlife and their habitats but also on the nation’s drinking water sources,” said Vera Smith, director of national forests and lands for Defenders of Wildlife, a national group.
“America’s roadless forests are crucial strongholds for wildlife including at-risk species that are battling extinction. Sec. Rollins’ boon to industry is yet another punishing blow to the American people and the wildlife and wild places we all hold dear,” Smith said in a written statement.
The Roadless Rule has been the subject of lawsuits for decades, particularly in Alaska, where most of the California-sized Tongass is covered by the rule.
Republican presidents have sought to reduce or eliminate the rule and have been opposed in court by environmental groups. Democratic presidents have sought to keep the rule and have been opposed by logging and development trade groups.
If the Roadless Rule were a box, almost all of the action since 2001 has taken place within that box, as groups attempt to exempt certain states or parts of states.
The new rulemaking process announced by Rollins would throw out the box altogether.
“What Secretary Rollins pledged today was to rescind the whole Roadless Rule, the whole enchilada,” said Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans at the law firm Earthjustice.
More than 96% of roadless areas are located in 12 Western states, and Alaska alone has almost 15 million acres of roadless area, mostly in Southeast Alaska, but also in the Chugach National Forest near Anchorage.
Idaho, which has the second-largest amount of roadless Forest Service land, is already exempted from the Roadless Rule, as is Colorado. Idaho and Colorado have state-specific rules that supersede the federal rule.
Montana, the No. 3 roadless state, has more than 6 million acres of roadless forest.
“They are the wildest lands on the National Forest System, de facto wilderness. And the only reason to rescind the Roadless Rule is if you want to undermine the wild character of these lands by invading the wilderness,” Caputo said.
Rollins, speaking in New Mexico, said she believes that rescinding the rule would allow the Forest Service and other organizations to more efficiently fight fires in national forests and allow timber cutting that could reduce fire danger.
“That’s great news,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, in response to Rollins’ announcement.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it, and if we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve (timber) production,” Cox said.
In Southeast Alaska, the Tongass National Forest is a rainforest and isn’t subject to significant wildfire danger. Rescinding the Roadless Rule there would directly allow new mines and logging.
The proposal drew immediate pushback from regional conservationists.
“The Tongass National Forest is our home — it sustains our communities, supports our fisheries, our recreation and tourism economy, provides critical climate change mitigation, and nourishes the deer and salmon we rely on for sustenance,” said Maggie Rabb, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, in a written statement. “Opening up more of the Tongass to large-scale, clearcut logging is an existential threat to the authentic values of the forest and our Southeast Alaska ways of life.”
SEACC and a collection of environmental, tourism and tribal groups are currently fighting a lawsuit that seeks to reverse the Roadless Rule in the Tongass.
The lead plaintiff in that suit is the Alaska Forest Association, a logging trade group whose leadership praised the new plan.
“The Alaska Forest Association applauds the Secretary’s decision to repeal the Roadless Rule,” said Tessa Axelson, the association’s director.
“The Rule has contributed to the decline of the timber industry in Southeast Alaska for over twenty years, and more importantly, limited critical access for project development and mining that can and should support rural community needs, decrease energy costs, and power the economy of AK, and the United States,” Axelson said in an email provided by the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing the Forest Association in its lawsuit.
“By rescinding the rule, the Secretary is taking a step in the right direction to restore Congress’s intent that our natural resources should be put to productive use and our forests should be actively managed,” she said.
Back in New Mexico, Rollins insinuated that the Roadless Rule repeal is only one of several policy proposals that the Trump administration is planning.
“We are not even six months into what promises to be arguably one of the most transformative administrations of our lifetime,” she said.

People interested in attending the event can register online through the America250 website. The U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, also known as America250, is the initiative organizing events with Trump and others leading up to the 250th anniversary of the United States’ founding in 2026. In a news release, the organization said the Iowa event will be the starting point for a nationwide tour celebrating the U.S. “where America250 will unite our nation through events in every state and territory, culminating in the most monumental celebration our Country has ever known.”
America250 was also involved in the military parade taking place on Trump’s birthday earlier in June that drew some criticism over high costs.
Attendees at the Iowa kickoff will “get an exciting preview of these impactful initiatives” planned for the upcoming year. The event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines July 3 has pre-programming beginning at 5 p.m., with Trump scheduled to speak at 7:30 p.m.
Monica Crowley, a spokesperson for America250, said in a statement the organization is ready to launch the year of celebrations in Iowa.
“America250 is proud to host this historic kick-off event in Iowa, in keeping with President Trump’s commitment to provide a grand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion of America’s 250th birthday,” Crowley said. “This special event serves as the magnificent start of a dynamic, year-long commemoration across our beautiful country, unveiling a vision for a renewed commitment to America’s future.”
Trump had spoken in 2023 about his plans for a yearlong celebration for America’s 250th birthday, proposing the Iowa State Fair as a starting place for what he called the “Great American State Fair.”
“My hope is that the amazing people of Iowa will work with my administration to open up the legendary Iowa State Fairgrounds to host the great American state fair and welcome millions and millions of visitors from around the world to the heartland of America for this special one-time festival,” Trump said in a May 2023 video. “Together we will build it and they will come.”
Though the event is at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines, the Iowa State Fair itself is not until August — taking place this year from Aug. 7 through 17. Trump attended the state fair in 2023 and 2015 during his campaigns for the presidency. He also has held several other events at the state fairgrounds, including rallies in 2015 and 2021.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/trumpcoralville1-scaled-e1702521234339-1024x687.jpg,,,2025-06-24 16:14:18.432251

Mike Lee said changes are coming to his proposed public land sale, which is currently facing a roadblock after the Senate Parliamentarian rejected it Monday evening. 
For weeks, controversy has simmered over Lee’s attempt to include mandatory public land sales in Congress’ budget bill, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill.” Lee’s proposal would require the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service to each dispose of 0.5% to 0.75% of their land across 11 Western states — that’s roughly between 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. 
Lee said the land sale is designed to help Western communities manage growth, and the parcels should be used for housing. But critics from all political backgrounds have come out in staunch opposition, noting that there’s no mandate requiring the land be used for housing. Plus, according to the bill text, more than 258 million acres would be eligible for sale, including 18.7 million acres in Utah. 
Changes to Senate Republicans’ budget proposal means even more Utah public land could be sold

But in a social media post Monday night, Lee said he now wants to eliminate forest service land from the proposal, writing, “We are NOT selling off our forests.” He also said he would “significantly reduce” the amount of Bureau of Land Management land for sale by including a provision that requires eligible parcels to be within five miles of a “population center.” 
Lee also said he would include “freedom zones” to ensure the land benefits American families, and that the bill would “protect our farmers, ranchers and recreational users. They come first.” Lee did not elaborate in his social media post. 
Lee has been hinting at a change for several days, acknowledging the flurry of criticism. Hundreds of conservation, environmental, hunter and angler groups have come out against his proposal — Lee has even suggested there’s a well-funded opposition campaign targeting his bill, writing on X, “How much money do you think has been spent on this campaign against my lands bill?” 
The proposed change comes as Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough rejected a number of items proposed by Senate Republicans. The parliamentarian is a nonpartisan, unelected adviser to the Senate who ensures the body doesn’t stray from their rules during budget reconciliation — that includes enforcing the Byrd Rule, which requires that reconciliation bills stay focused on fiscal issues. 
Anything considered nonbudgetary could be subjected to a point-of-order, which is what happened to Lee’s public land sale proposal on Monday evening. 
Per Senate rules, Lee’s provision would require a minimum of 60 votes — rather than a simple majority — otherwise it would be subjected to a point-of-order objection. 
Lee’s public land sale is one of seven proposals from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources that the parliamentarian says goes against the Byrd Rule.

A number of public land advocacy groups expressed cautious optimism on Tuesday in response to MacDonough’s announcement. 
“This is a significant win for public lands. Thankfully, the Senate Parliamentarian has seen Senator Lee’s ridiculous attempt to sell off millions of acres of public lands for what it is — an ideological crusade against public lands, not a serious proposal to raise revenue for the federal government,” said Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities. 
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance highlighted the “nationwide backlash” sparked by Lee’s proposal. 
“While we’re glad to see the sell-off plan removed from the Budget Bill, we know Lee’s underlying goal remains the same: to sell off America’s public lands using any excuse or legislative opportunity he can find,” said Scott Braden, the group’s executive director. 
And the Center for Biological Diversity said that while Lee’s proposal may be caught up in Senate rules, they expect similar attempts from the senior Utah Republican. 
“His legislation was always about destroying public lands anywhere and everywhere, privatizing cherished recreation destinations and locking away these beautiful places for the ultra-rich. No one should believe his lies now, and any backroom deals to rewrite his legislation will still be a disaster for public lands,” said Laiken Jordahl with the center. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Tuesday, the group Vet Voice Foundation, a military veteran advocacy group, hosted a virtual town hall where veterans and policy experts spoke against Lee’s proposal. Lee was invited to join the discussion but did not attend, and the group displayed a symbolic empty chair in his place. 
Among the speakers was New Mexico Democrat Rep. Gabe Vasquez, who helped form the Public Lands Caucus with Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke. 
The caucus’ first order of business was to sink a proposal from Utah Rep. Celeste Maloy, a Republican, who identified roughly 11,500 acres of federal land in southwestern Utah to sell to St. George, Washington and Beaver Counties, and the Washington County Water Conservancy District. 
“We were able to successfully kill that provision in the House only to see it come back from the dead in true zombie fashion, more powerful and uglier, in this proposal from Sen. Lee,” said Vasquez. “I’ve worked on a lot of conservation campaigns. I have not seen conservationists from every stripe come together more — Republicans and Democrats, anglers and birders, RVers and mountain bikers — to protect this special resource.” 
Vasquez warned Lee, and any other politician eying a public land sale, that the newly-formed caucus will be a roadblock. 
“Folks should know whenever they bring these proposals forward, especially in the House, that they’re going to have to go up against the caucus,” he said.

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday afternoon that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land.
Rollins, speaking at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said.
 

The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy.
“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.”
The “Roadless Rule” repeal would mean more than 58 million acres of land in 38 states would lose their protections. In New Mexico, according to Forest Service data, about 1.6 million acres, or roughly 2,500 square miles, of land in all the state’s national forests have some level of protections. A 2003 Forest Service map suggests most of the areas losing protections are in the Santa Fe and Gila national forests.
 

The announcement drew mixed reactions from the western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said.
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office.
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation.
 

Rollins made the announcement during one of several keynote addresses by President Donald Trump’s cabinet members during the WGA conference. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spoke earlier Monday, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke afterward.
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The vigil included prayer for incarcerated people in solitary confinement and for the families of Shawnee Reed and Brittany Doescher, who died at Taycheedah Correctional Institution. 
“We’re all human,” JOSHUA Coordinator Caitlin Haynes said. “So whether you committed a crime or not, you deserve humane treatment. So we’re here for that, and to bring light to the situation that they deserve better.”
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections reports on how long prisoners spend in disciplinary separation, where a prisoner might be sent after committing a violation. GBCI has the longest average length of stay in disciplinary separation of any of the adult facilities listed, at 48.6 days, as of the most recent data.
JOSHUA, a local affiliate of the advocacy organization WISDOM, holds monthly vigils at Green Bay Correctional. 
Leslie Hill, who attended the event, said her son died by suicide after leaving prison. 
“I spoke to him daily whenever he wasn’t in solitary, and he had many traumatic experiences,” Hill said. “He had no support. And he was facing one more charge, he was on bond. I had bonded him out to have some mental health treatment…and I think [a] contributing factor to his death was [the prospect of going back].”

In a post before the event, WISDOM said advocates were gathering with four other groups “to call on Gov. Evers to veto any budget that continues to invest in punishment over people.” At a rally at the Capitol in late May, advocates called on the governor to veto the budget if it lacked certain items. 
“We’re urging [Evers] to veto any budget that does not include adequate investments in health care, child care and public education,” said Mark Rice, Wisconsin Transformational Justice Campaign Coordinator at WISDOM. “Also, we want him to ensure that no new prisons are included in the budget… Also wanting to adequately fund measures in the budget that would reduce the prison population.” 
GBCI’s future to be determined 
In February, Gov. Tony Evers laid out a plan that included closing GBCI in 2029 and updating Waupun Correctional Institution (WCI).
Last week, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee approved a level of corrections spending that was significantly lower than Evers’ proposal.
Co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said GBCI wouldn’t be discussed until later in the week, when the committee would take up the capital budget. That meeting was canceled. 
According to the Evers administration, the governor’s plan opted to close GBCI instead of Waupun because of local support for closing GBCI and the lower cost of updating the Waupun facility, the Examiner reported in February.
Long stays in restricted housing
According to the most recent data, 138 incarcerated people were in disciplinary separation at GBCI, and 71 incarcerated people had been in restrictive housing for over 30 days. This was the highest of any facility listed and nearly triple the number at the second highest facility. 
Over the years, the average length of stay in disciplinary separation has declined across facilities, from 39.7 days in 2019 to 27.8 days in May 2025. 
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections has entered a contract with a third-party management and consulting firm, Falcon Correctional and Community Services, Inc. The partnership includes studying restrictive housing practices at adult prisons. 
An aging facility 
GBCI was built starting in 1898. As of June 20, it housed 381 more incarcerated people than its design capacity of 749. 
Overcrowding puts additional burdens on staff to maintain a facility’s safety and security, a 2020 draft report on the Wisconsin Department of Corrections website stated. Overcrowding also “stresses inmate programs and support functions.” 
The report found that GBCI and Waupun Correctional Institution, the oldest facilities in the system, were both “at or nearing the end of their useful lives.”
Without extensive demolition and reconstruction of housing, program and support services buildings, the report stated, “they will not begin to achieve the safety, security, efficiency and flexibility found in modern correctional institution design.”
Maximum security housing at the prisons opened with 50 square foot cells designed for single occupancy, according to the report. Most of those cells were being used to house two people, presented operational issues and did not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or meet American Correctional Association standards. 
The report said new maximum security housing was needed in the long term. In the short term, “consideration should be given to reducing populations at GBCI and WCI if possible to allow for more single occupancy cells.” 
The 2020 report also said a number of facilities have ADA-accessible housing accommodations, but “there exists a particular lack of accessibility at the GBCI and WCI maximum security institutions.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 19:07:03+00:00,CT Mirror,Family of man with ALS who died within 24 hours of incarceration sues DOC,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/24/d-death-als-lawsuit/,Disability Rights CT investigated Robert Bracey's death and alleged in a report in April that DOC staff ignored his ALS-driven dietary needs.,"Family members of a man who died within 24 hours of being admitted to Bridgeport Correctional Center are suing the state Department of Correction for allegedly failing to provide the medical care he needed and falsifying records after his death. 
Robert Bracey, who died in June 2022 at age 56, was the subject of a report published in April by the advocacy group Disability Rights Connecticut. The organization’s investigation alleged the nurses and correction officers who responded to Bracey’s death ignored his ALS-driven dietary needs. It also asserted the staff did not actively monitor Bracey’s ongoing opiate withdrawal and delayed trying to revive him for nearly 20 minutes after finding him unresponsive.
The report did not identify the man who died, but family members said the report refers to Bracey. 
The lawsuit comes after the Bracey family held a press conference at the Capitol in Hartford, where they called on state officials to hold the department responsible for the medical care of all incarcerated people.
Robyn Bracey, the daughter of Robert Bracey and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, told those gathered at the press conference, “ I just want y’all to know that he was more than a dad. He was a hero. He was a best friend.” She said she did not find out about her father’s death until three days after it occurred. 
“ [The Department of Correction] needs to be accountable and held accountable for the things they did. They took someone very dear and special to us. My life will never be the same,” Robyn Bracey said. 
DOC Spokesperson Andrius Banevicius declined to comment Tuesday on the pending lawsuit.
The Bracey family’s complaint echoed many of the claims found in the Disability Rights CT report, alleging that correction staff gave Robert Bracey a meal without the thickening agent necessary for him to be able to swallow it. 
The complaint also noted that the nurse who conducted Bracey’s initial assessment noted that he was “extremely frail,” in heroin withdrawal, vomiting and having trouble speaking. The nurse sent him to the infirmary ward of the facility.
According to the lawsuit, Bracey had been at Stamford Hospital 24 hours before entering the Correctional Center. Robyn Bracey told the Connecticut Mirror that he had been rushed to the hospital from his arraignment hearing because of ALS and withdrawal symptoms.  
ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a progressive neurological disorder that slowly takes away a person’s ability to control their own muscles. The disease is fatal and affects a person’s ability to move, speak, eat and perform other voluntary functions.
Both the report and the lawsuit alleged that a correction staff member falsely recorded “safety checks” that had never been performed. Under department policy, correction officers were supposed to check on Bracey every 15 minutes because of his medical condition. 
Medical staff also allegedly failed to perform an assessment on Bracey for opioid withdrawal. Instead, according to the report and the lawsuit, two nurses entered two different screening scores into Bracey’s medical records after his death. Finally, the lawsuit claims that corrections staff waited 12 minutes before starting to perform CPR on Bracey. 
According to the Disability Rights CT report, two of the nurses involved in the case are being investigated by the state Department of Public Health. Two lieutenants received suspensions that were later reduced, and one correction officer was dismissed but later had that dismissal reversed and was able to receive back pay. It took over two years for DOC to discipline those involved. 
At the time of the report’s release, department spokesperson Ashley McCarthy said that the department “takes the health and well-being of all those under its supervision very seriously and continuously strives to ensure that the incarcerated population receives the best level of care possible.” 
After the press conference last week, Robyn Bracey described her father as an “all-around good guy.” She told CT Mirror that he wrote poetry and worked as a carpenter before being diagnosed in 2015 with ALS. “[His] first time ever meeting you, he would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it,” she said. 
Bracey was previously arrested at the age of 48 and spent three years in prison, after which he was released to a halfway house, according to a blurb in the 2017 annual report of Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery. He began volunteering, including acting as a peer group facilitator, in January 2017. Robyn Bracey said that her father got his OSHA license and started a course of studies at Housatonic Community College. In 2018, he won a personal achievement award from the Bridgeport Re-entry Collaborative. 
But Bracey began to struggle again after his long-time partner died from Covid in April of 2020, according to Robyn Bracey, who said she found out a year later that he had gone back to using drugs. His ALS was also worsening, and in early 2021, he had to stop working because the muscles in his neck and hands were deteriorating. He was arrested in June 2022 on charges of sale and possession of narcotics and possession with intent to sell. 
“ He meant the world to me and my family. Despite his circumstances, he took care of his family and friends. He had a heart of gold,” his daughter said. 
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled Bracey’s death the result of  “complications of acute and chronic opioid use.” His final diagnoses included “acute intoxication” from fentanyl, fluid accumulation in his lungs, and a type of pneumonia that causes inflammation in the lungs.

They join a growing list of schools in the district that are embracing renewable energy.,"Two New Haven schools will soon be partly powered by solar panels. They join a growing list of schools in the district that are embracing renewable energy.
L.W. Beecher Museum Magnet School of Arts and Sciences and Hill Central School will be the first in New Haven to have solar panel parking canopies.
More than 950 solar panels will be installed. Mayor Justin Elicker said his city will continue to transition away from fossil fuels despite the federal government’s backtracking.
“There are a lot of benefits that people know about solar,” Elicker said. “And in the work that we are doing to help support our climate and address climate change. When the federal government has really been backtracking, New Haven continues to take the lead.”
The new panels are expected to save the schools more than a million dollars in operating costs over the next 20 years.
Around 35% of their energy is expected to come from the solar panels once they’re installed.
State Rep. Steve Winter (D-New Haven), who is also the city’s Director of Climate and Sustainability, said the panels will save $27,000 in energy costs in the first year. That number is expected to continue to go up.
“We’re all often looking at things that we can do to keep money here in the community, and by utilizing federal tax credits the state’s non renewable energy solutions program and power purchase agreement, we can do that,” Winter said.
The panels are expected to be installed this summer.

June 24, 2025 | Photo By Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was in the hot seat on Tuesday as Republicans on the House Oversight Committee grilled her over upcoming fixes to the state’s new online campaign finance reporting system.
Benson and her team at the Michigan Department of State have been talking about problems with the new system since it was launched earlier this year – issues that have made it difficult for lawmakers, candidates and lobbyists to file finance disclosures and even more difficult for average citizens to track them for transparency’s sake.
Republicans took back control of the House of Representatives at the beginning of the year, and the House Oversight Committee has spent considerable time parsing the issue. That led Benson to finally appear before the committee on Tuesday to talk about what’s being done to fix the bugs.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The secretary of state told reporters in a virtual press call held Friday that a corrective action plan, a new “go live” approval process and additional project management support were among steps her department was taking to fix issues with the new system.
Before taking questions from lawmakers on Tuesday, Benson presented updates to the system and the timeline for key fixes – much of which was already presented to the committee in May and again for reporters on Friday.
What was new in that information was that the vendor, Tyler Technologies, would be offering the state a $166,000 refund on downtime the state has experienced as fixes commence. It was previously reported that refunds would be issued, but at what amount was unknown until Tuesday’s hearing. Benson said that figure was based on the number of hours in which the system was not functioning properly or if the public search function was down.
Much of the back and forth between lawmakers on the GOP-led panel focused on whether Benson knew Tyler Technologies had acquired the company that owned the previous campaign finance system prior to entering a contract with the state to build a new one. Tyler Technologies also became one of the only bidders on the project. 
Another firm bid on the proposal to build the system but was deemed unqualified, leaving only Tyler Technologies.
That was a point of contention when Benson’s chief of staff, Christina Anderson, testified before the committee in May.
There was also significant fire from Republicans on the panel, including its chair, state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay), toward Benson, on why the new system was launched before it was ready for prime time, and whether the department was willing to walk away from Tyler Technologies and find a new firm if they couldn’t get the job done.
As to whether or not she knew about Tyler Technologies’ connection with the old campaign finance system before becoming the state’s vendor for the new system, Benson said much of the early work on the project was delegated to her team within the department.
Hall calls for Oversight Committee investigation into Michigan’s new campaign finance portal

“That wouldn’t be something that would typically be brought to the granular level of my decision making,” Benson said.
DeBoyer countered by noting that the committee was talking about nearly $10 million of the state’s money, and that Benson should have been in the loop, let alone making the decisions on whether to move forward in contract with Tyler Technologies.
When pressed further, Anderson and Benson did note that Tyler Technologies disclosed its connection to the old system.
In defense of the decision to use Tyler Technologies, Anderson said that its contract was a flat fee structure for the product the company promised to deliver. 
In the context of the issues that are currently plaguing the system, Anderson said if it gets to the point where they have paid Tyler Technologies in full and still haven’t received a fully-functioning campaign finance reporting system as promised, the company would still be on the hook to deliver without additional payments.
Tyler Technologies has also ramped up resources to the project without the state incurring any additional expense.
DeBoyer asked why Tyler Technologies couldn’t have just put the old system back into operation while it worked out the kinks in the new system. A representative from the company said that, from a technical perspective, it could have.
But Benson, Anderson and Tyler Technologies all insisted that the new system did work despite flaws and bugs that needed to be addressed. Benson said her team, with assistance from Tyler Technologies and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, were proactively testing out bugs in the system.
When Anderson noted that some of the same data lag and site issues that affected the old system were in part some of the same bugs they were seeing in the new system, DeBoyer scoffed and said it appeared the state got the same product it was trying to do away with.
Benson again said her department believes in continuous improvement, and that’s why it was so important to update the campaign finance reporting system with more robust and modern technology.
State Rep. Jaime Greene (R-Richmond) thanked Benson for getting the state and its lawmakers off a system that initially ran off a floppy desk using the antiquated MS-DOS operating system, but asked the secretary of state who was to blame for the recent failures.
Instead of passing the buck, Benson said it was on her and she continued to praise her team for their efforts.
The committee fielded only a few questions from Democratic members, a point that was raised by state Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) and state Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing), both of whom said they were frustrated that DeBoyer chose mostly members of his caucus to question Benson.
DeBoyer, Benson spar over gubernatorial campaign finance violation
As an aside, DeBoyer also grilled Benson over Attorney General Dana Nessel’s determination that the secretary of state committed a campaign finance law violation by holding her 2026 gubernatorial campaign announcement in the lobby of the building that houses her department.
Nessel’s office noted, however, that it did not have the authority to impose any civil penalties against Benson, nor any criminal penalties outlined in the law. 
DeBoyer on Tuesday specifically questioned Benson on that point, and asked if she intended to turn the matter back over to the attorney general’s office to issue sanctions against her, or handle it internally and sanction herself.
Benson in response said she was “very flattered” that DeBoyer appeared to be hanging on her every word regarding the violation, but added that her department did not reach out to the attorney general’s office because the opinion clearly resolved the issue, meaning there were no sanctions or other penalties left to consider.
That said, Benson was adamant that even the secretary of state be treated like every other candidate in Michigan, and acknowledged that a violation had occurred.
Benson later approached the dais after the meeting to talk with DeBoyer, which appeared cordial but tense from afar.
Michigan Advance asked about the interaction following the meeting. 
Benson said DeBoyer did continue to share his opinions about the campaign finance violation, but that she also used the opportunity to share with DeBoyer that she appreciated the work he was doing on the House Oversight Committee.
“What I was trying to communicate to him was that I want to work with him more. I want us to work together to make sure he feels he’s able to get information from our office in a regular manner, and that we have a collaborative working relationship,” Benson said. “So, that was my purpose in reaching out to him. And I hope he can see that we actually are more aligned and alike than he may realize.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250624_094648-1024x730.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

Healey's $7.5 billion proposal would continue to fund state government for about another month if the next spending cycle begins without a final budget in place.
The post Healey buys lawmakers time with $7.5B interim budget filing appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","LAWMAKERS WORKING on a compromise state budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 could get four more weeks of runway under an interim spending bill Gov. Maura Healey filed Monday.
Healey submitted a nearly $7.5 billion proposal (HD 4844) that would continue to fund state government for about another month if the next spending cycle begins without a final budget in place.
The governor wrote in a letter alongside the bill that the funding would “maintain necessary services through July 31, 2025, pending the passage of the General Appropriations Act.”
Interim budgets — sometimes referred to as one-twelfth budgets because they usually cover about a month — have become a common occurrence on Beacon Hill each summer as House and Senate Democrats stretch their private budget talks into the next fiscal year.
Massachusetts regularly produces some of the latest state budgets in the nation, and it has not had a final spending plan signed into law on time since fiscal year 2011.
House Speaker Ron Mariano said Monday he’s optimistic about the chances of agreeing on the budget by the end of the month, and Senate President Karen Spilka added that negotiators are “very close.”
The House and Senate are each holding a formal session Thursday, and the branches could use those sessions to send the interim budget back for the governor to sign into law.
The governor gets 10 days to review any legislation, so even if the Legislature strikes a deal before July 1, having an interim budget in place would allow Healey to use all of the time constitutionally allotted to her without impacting state spending.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A Utah college student arrested by federal immigration agents in Mesa County earlier this month was released Friday after what she called the “nightmare” of a 15-day stay in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora.
Caroline Dias Goncalves was detained by ICE in Grand Junction on June 5, shortly after being pulled over by a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy in a separate traffic stop, from which she was let go with a warning. The deputy has been placed on leave amid an internal investigation into whether a Signal message leading to Dias Goncalves’ arrest violated Colorado laws prohibiting cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE.
The University of Utah nursing student was then held at the ICE facility in Aurora, operated by private prison firm GEO Group, before being released on bond Friday evening, she said in a statement released through immigration advocates on Monday.
“The past 15 days have been the hardest of my life,” Dias Goncalves said. “I was scared and felt alone. I was placed in a system that treated me like I didn’t matter.”



A daily average of more than 1,100 people are held in the Aurora ICE detention center, the only such facility in Colorado. Dias Goncalves, who was born in Brazil and brought to the U.S. as a 7-year-old, described having to eat soggy food — “even the bread would come wet,” she said — and other dehumanizing treatment towards detainees in the facility.
“The moment they realized I spoke English, I saw a change. Suddenly, I was treated better than others who didn’t speak English,” her statement added. “That broke my heart. Because no one deserves to be treated like that. Not in a country that I’ve called home since I was 7 years old and is all I’ve ever known.”
ICE has not replied to questions from Newsline and other media outlets about Dias Goncalves’ arrest, which has sparked an outcry from national groups that advocate on behalf of “Dreamers,” young adults who lack permanent legal status after being brought to the U.S. as children.
“We are hurting our nation — and our very soul — when we target immigrant youth this way,” Gaby Pacheco, president of the advocacy group TheDream.US, said in a statement on Dias Goncalves’ release. “One traffic stop. One unlawful arrest. And a lifetime of trauma. Enough is enough.”
Tensions over immigration enforcement have risen across the country in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has directed ICE to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. That has included an order to the agency to meet an arrest quota of at least 3,000 people per day.
Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people taken into ICE custody despite having no criminal record — Dias Goncalves among them — has risen sharply since January.
Representatives for Dias Goncalves said she and her family were requesting privacy following her release. In her statement, she said she would try to “move forward” and focus on work and school, and directly addressed the ICE agent who detained her.

(Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A taxpayer-funded attorney will defend suspended Rep. RJ May against charges of distributing child sexual abuse material, a federal judge decided Tuesday.
May, a founding member of the uber-conservative House Freedom Caucus, pleaded not guilty to the charges June 12. He was arrested the day before at his West Columbia home.
But the 38-year-old married father of two doesn’t own the home, he told federal Magistrate Shiva Hodges on Tuesday. His wife’s name is the only one on the title, according to Lexington County property records. May claimed to own no assets but his pickup truck, Hodges told the court.
May paid property taxes on a 2019 Ram 1500 and a 2017 Chevy Suburban last year, according to public tax records.
SC representative charged with distributing child sexual abuse material

May’s financial status warranted a public defender, assigned to people who can’t otherwise afford an attorney, Hodges decided. She assigned Jenny Smith, an assistant federal defender based in Columbia.
Smith will defend May against the 10 counts of distributing child sexual abuse material. His previous attorney suggested May was set up by unnamed “political enemies.”
The charges stem from April 2024, when social messaging app Kik notified the nonprofit National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of videos involving child sexual abuse sent from an account called “joebidennnn69.” Investigators found at least 220 different videos and images depicting sexual abuse of young children, including toddlers and infants, saved to the account, a special agent for the Department of Homeland Security testified in court earlier this month.
Law enforcement tracked the account to May’s home and cellphone, which matched the network addresses used, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
May had previously hired Columbia defense attorney Dayne Phillips to represent him after federal investigators seized electronics from his home last August. Because of that, Phillips represented May during his first appearance in court June 12, during which he argued someone may have taken control of May’s phone or home internet. Prosecutors noted that access to May’s home WiFi and phone both required passwords.
May declined to hire Phillips as his attorney moving forward, Phillips notified the court Friday.
The determination to assign a public defender is made based on a number of factors, including a person’s income, debt, monthly expenses, savings and assets. The form defendants fill out is not available to the public, so May’s exact financial status is unclear.
May, who first won office himself in 2020, owns Ivory Tusk Consulting and ran campaigns for GOP candidates who aligned with his hardline brand of conservatism.
The consulting business received payments from clients, including current representatives, as recently as February. In 2024, his consulting firm received $309,000 from South Carolina candidates who paid him for consulting services as well as for mailers, signs and door hangers, according to public campaign disclosures.
SC representative arrested, booked in Lexington County jail

For 2024, May also received $34,795 for his job as a legislator. That included his salary, a per diem that’s meant to cover food and lodging while legislators are in session, a $1,000-a-month stipend for “in-district” expenses, mileage reimbursements, and postage, according to his latest public economic statement.
For more than two years, he helped lead the faction of Republicans in the South Carolina House that’s been warring with the majority caucus in the supermajority GOP chamber.
While under federal investigation, May continued showing up to session every day this year, but he stayed quiet instead of participating in debates. He voted alongside the Freedom Caucus, though he hasn’t been a member since last August, when news broke that federal authorities seized his computers.
Following his arrest, May was suspended from the state House without pay pending the case’s outcome, the House Speaker’s Office said in a letter after the charges became public. State law requires suspension for officeholders indicted on felonies.
House Majority Leader Davey Hiott filed a complaint with the House Ethics Commission to investigate May, a first step toward expelling him from the House.
“The conduct these charges allege are reprehensible, vile, and have no place in our society, let alone in the House of Representatives,” the Pickens Republican said in a statement earlier this month.
Other representatives, including the Freedom Caucus that May helped start, have called for May to resign his seat.
May is being held in the Edgefield County Detention Center while awaiting trial. He appeared in court Tuesday wearing a striped orange and white jumpsuit, with “ECDC” printed across the back.
If convicted, May faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, speaks with reporters in her office Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. Ayotte has proposed several changes to Medicaid aimed at cutting down the cost of the program that would increase the financial burden on recipients. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte will request a special session of the Legislature this week to prepare for the possibility that the House and Senate fail to pass a budget Thursday and allow for a continuing resolution, her office said Tuesday. 
In an announcement Tuesday morning, the governor’s office said Ayotte will present the proposal to the Executive Council Wednesday requesting the session for Friday, June 27.
The proposal will request that lawmakers pass a continuing resolution that would last 90 days, requiring the Legislature and the governor to work to craft and pass a compromise budget by Sept. 25. 
The move comes as Republican lawmakers and the governor are at odds over the state’s two-year budget, and as Ayotte has vowed to veto the final package if it is not changed. 
The full House and Senate are slated to meet Thursday to take up a vote on the two budget bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2. Last week, a panel of House and Senate leaders negotiated and agreed to final versions of those bills, which now need the approval of the full Legislature.
But Ayotte has raised concerns with the final compromise budget. On June 19, she criticized it for including a less-than-generous funding fix for a specific set of Group II retirees, who include police officers, firefighters, and corrections officers. She also spoke against a sweeping $51 million cut to the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as a change in the school funding formula that would see Manchester schools receive $10 million less than expected.
Ayotte said she would veto the budget if it weren’t changed. But the budget bills cannot be changed on Thursday; lawmakers may only vote to approve or kill them. 
Under Part 1, Article 50 of the New Hampshire Constitution, a governor can call the Legislature back into session, but the proposal must be approved by the Executive Council and the session must be limited to the governor’s stated purpose. 
The council meets Wednesday at 10 a.m. for its regularly scheduled meeting. In her official request, which she will present at the meeting, Ayotte mentioned her three budget priorities as the reason for a continuing resolution. The request does not mention Ayotte’s pledged veto. 
“We must continue to do the people’s work and deliver on our promises to all of New Hampshire,” Ayotte wrote. “That means keeping the state open, especially during our summer months, to serve the people of our great state. Doing the people’s work means putting together a responsible, balanced budget that keeps our promises to protect services for our most vulnerable citizens, ensure our children receive a best-in-class education, and take care of the men and women who have made our state the safest in the nation.”
Special sessions are relatively rare. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu called one in summer 2018 in an unsuccessful attempt to pass a bill protecting New Hampshire from out-of-state sales taxes in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair. A special session was also called in 2019 to allow the Legislature to pass a compromise budget after Sununu vetoed the Democratic-passed budget over a desire for continued tax reductions.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaid2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday afternoon that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land.
Rollins, speaking at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said.
US Interior Secretary Burgum hypes innovation at WGA, steers clear of public lands controversy

The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy.
“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.”
The “Roadless Rule” repeal would mean more than 58 million acres of land in 38 states would lose their protections. In New Mexico, according to Forest Service data, about 1.6 million acres, or roughly 2,500 square miles, of land in all the state’s national forests have some level of protections. A 2003 Forest Service map suggests most of the areas losing protections are in the Santa Fe and Gila national forests.
Public lands protesters picket Western governors’ conference

The announcement drew mixed reactions from the western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said.
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office.
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation.
Governors’ report outlines how western states, territories could build more affordable housing

Rollins made the announcement during one of several keynote addresses by President Donald Trump’s cabinet members during the WGA conference. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spoke earlier Monday, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke afterward.
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. Fifteen thousand nurses at 13 hospitals in the Twin Cities and Duluth could strike if they can’t reach a deal with their employers.
Nurses unionized with the Minnesota Nurses Association voted Monday to authorize a strike, though the union’s negotiations teams will determine if and when to call the strike.
Nurses authorized a strike at hospitals operated by Allina Health, Aspirus St. Luke’s, Children’s Minnesota, Essentia Health, M Health Fairview and North Memorial Health. The strikes, if called, could also impact dozens of Essentia Health clinics in northern Minnesota and some Allina Health infusion centers in the Twin Cities.
The nurses say their employers are violating the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to negotiate in good faith. Because the authorized strike is an “unfair labor practices strike” — based on allegations that employers are breaking the law — the nurses would have greater protections than they would if the strike was for better wages or hours.
A top priority for nurses is more staffing. Health care workers are five times more likely to be seriously injured from an assault at work than the U.S. workforce as a whole, and nurses say increased staffing can reduce the risk of violence while improving patient care.
But the union’s safe staffing proposals are a nonstarter for hospital management. 
“Nurses have brought forward serious proposals about affordable, accessible health care plans, safe staffing and protections against unsafe scheduling, the rising violence we face at work, and respect for professional sacrifices we make every day. Leadership has refused to meaningfully engage in these issues,” said Sydney Pederson, a nurse at M Health Fairview – Riverside.
Nurses said at a press conference Tuesday that hospitals have reneged on staffing agreements made in the last round of contract negotiations, in 2022, forcing nurses into a protracted grievance process that has yet to be resolved. 
A spokesperson for Allina Health said in a statement, “We are disappointed the union is once again choosing to focus its efforts on organizing its members to walk away from their jobs.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_7005-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

While the state isn’t facing any specific threat, the governor said his administration will continue work with federal agencies in monitoring the situation.
“My primary focus is on the safety and well-being of the people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — A candidate for governor of South Dakota endured two hours of questioning on a witness stand Monday about his efforts to restrict citizen-initiated ballot measures.
The candidate is Jon Hansen, who serves as speaker of the state House of Representatives and is running for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in next June’s primary election. He convinced his fellow legislators to pass a bill during the winter that makes the window for gathering ballot-question petition signatures three months shorter, by moving the election-year deadline for submitting signed petitions from May to February. 
Petitioners need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to place a proposed law on the ballot, or to refer a bill passed by legislators to the ballot as a question. The number of signatures required to petition a state constitutional amendment onto the ballot is 35,017.
Ballot group sues state over shorter petition circulation window

Dakotans for Health is a ballot question committee that has sponsored multiple petition drives. It’s suing South Dakota’s top elections official — the secretary of state — and asking a judge to stop enforcement of the new law. Monday’s proceeding at the federal courthouse in Rapid City was the first part of a hearing that will continue in early August. Meanwhile, the law is scheduled to take effect next Tuesday.
The lawsuit is the latest development in a longstanding struggle between ballot petitioners and Republican legislators over citizen lawmaking. Jim Leach, the lawyer representing Dakotans for Health, said in his opening statement that the earlier petition deadline is an unlawful attack on a form of free speech.
“Three months of core political speech are eliminated, out the window, cannot happen,” Leach said.
The secretary of state’s lawyer, Assistant Attorney General Grant Flynn, said in his opening statement that Hansen proposed the new law to allow adequate time for resolving disputes about the validity of petition signatures.
“What he has attempted to do is place proper guardrails so this process can be used effectively,” Flynn said.
Several times during witness testimony, Leach pointed to bills Hansen has sponsored during his legislative career to restrict citizen lawmaking. 
During this year’s legislative session, for example, Hansen prime-sponsored the bill to shorten the signature-gathering period and also prime-sponsored a bill adding justifications for the secretary of state to reject petition signatures, both of which passed. He co-sponsored a bill vetoed by the governor that would have required constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from registered voters in each of the 35 state Senate districts. Existing law allows signatures to come from registered voters anywhere in the state.
The state’s lawyer, in response, asked Hansen if he’s opposed to the initiative process or wants to repeal it. Hansen answered no to both questions.
Monday wasn’t the first time that Hansen — who has his own private law practice — has tussled with Leach and Dakotans for Health in court. Last year, Hansen helped lead a lawsuit attempting to disqualify Dakotans for Health’s abortion-rights ballot question. The lawsuit claimed numerous petition signatures should have been invalidated because of alleged legal infractions by petition circulators, including failing to show signers the attorney general’s explanation of the measure and leaving petitions unattended, among other accusations.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Hansen alleged Monday on the stand, under questioning from the state’s lawyer, that one of the reasons the earlier lawsuit didn’t make it to trial before last fall’s election was because Leach deliberately stalled the proceedings. That was among the reasons Hansen wanted to shorten the window for signature collecting, he said — to allow more time for litigation to play out and avoid the possibility of a “completely unlawful” measure being placed on the ballot.
Hansen’s group, the Life Defense Fund, ultimately dropped the earlier lawsuit after voters rejected the abortion-rights ballot measure in November.
Leach, during his questioning of Hansen, methodically attacked the stalling allegation. Relying on records from the earlier lawsuit, Leach showed, for example, that he sometimes took less time to file his motions and responses than Hansen’s side did — forcing Hansen to admit that those examples reflected Leach’s promptness. Leach also showed that Hansen’s lead co-counsel in the earlier case, Sara Frankenstein, told the judge at one point that she had no availability during a three-week period, forcing Hansen to answer “yes” when Leach asked if that slowed down the case.
Frankenstein was unavailable to participate in Monday’s hearing. The judge granted the state’s request to continue the hearing and set a date of Aug. 8 so Frankenstein can testify.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/591A0101-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

Ron DeSantis signed a bill Tuesday that repeals a 2018 law that opponents argued limited public beach access in Walton County in northwest Florida.
Appearing in Santa Rosa Beach with emerald gulf waters behind him, the governor said SB 1622 returns to local governments decision-making about recreational access to the dry sand areas of Florida beaches.
“This bill is about restoring local control, cutting legal red tape, and putting our residents first,” DeSantis said.
Filed by Panama City Republican state Sen. Jay Trumbull, SB 1622 repeals the earlier law that established a judicial review process that governmental entities had to go through before passing any regulations regarding the customary use of any private beach property. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Sponsored by Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, the 2018 law was lauded at the time by beachfront property owners, including U.S. Ambassador to Israel and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.
Signed into law by former Gov. Rick Scot,t the law applied retroactively and blunted a 2016 Walton County ordinance that allowed for customary use of the beaches.
Counties throughout the state have long abided by the concept of “customary use” of beachfront, meaning people have been using the beaches for decades and should continue that public use, also meaning private property owner can’t restrict the public from enjoying those spaces.
“This bill is much more than policy. It’s about families, it’s about tradition, and it’s about restoring something that never should have been taken away in the first place,” said Trumbull, who joined DeSantis at the press conference.
The bill passed the House 108-8 and the Senate 35-2  with the two dissenting votes cast by Passidomo and Sen. Don Gaetz, who owns a home in Seaside, a master planned community in Walton County across the street from the beach.
Gaetz predicted the bill won’t solve disputes in Walton County and, during debate on the bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee, predicted just the opposite and warned it would result in litigation.
“My fear is, in fact, my hard prediction is, that whatever you do with this bill is not going to solve the problems in Walton County of people who think they own property near the beach or on the beach because they bought it from being very upset when somebody else tries to use that property,” Gaetz said. “The issues won’t go away.”
SB 1622 also makes it easier to restore eroded beaches in certain Gulf Coast counties with smaller populations. To promote that provision of the law, DeSantis was joined by Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Alexis Lambert, who noted, “Of Walton County’s 26 miles of beach, nearly 19 miles are now considered critically eroded and in need of nourishment.” 
“The bill clarifies how local governments can set beach use rules without unnecessary red tape. It also simplifies how we can set erosion control lines, allowing vital beach nourishment projects to move forward more efficiently. This means stronger, healthier beaches, clearer access, and a balance between public enjoyment and private property rights,” Lambert said.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Speaking at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe on Monday, United States Education Secretary Linda McMahon defended her agency’s return to collecting student loan payments from millions of borrowers, calling the pandemic-era pause “confusing” for students and their parents.
On May 5, the Education Department announced it would resume federal student loan collections after President Joe Biden’s administration paused them in March 2020. In a news release, McMahon said the resumption of collections meant that, “American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies.”
As feds resume student loan collections, states try to catch borrowers before they sink

During her keynote address, McMahon said the Education Department had already received about $200 million in payments. The payments represent the first collection in more than five years and come after the Supreme Court stymied Biden’s efforts to forgive billions in student loan debt during his presidency.
McMahon said times have changed since March 2020, and resumption of collections, among other benefits, eliminates confusion borrowers face about whether and when to repay their loans with potential loan forgiveness hanging over their heads. 
“One father told me: He said, ‘You know, my kids were covered under an educational trust fund that I set up for them, but I wasn’t sure that I wanted to pay out that money, because if it was going to be forgiven, was that short changing them in the long run?’” she said. 
More than 10% of New Mexicans have student loan debt, according to EducationData.org, which says that 226,000 New Mexicans in 2024 had an average debt of $34,071. 
A spokesperson for the New Mexico Higher Education Department did not respond to a request for comment from Source New Mexico about McMahon’s comments. 
In addition to her comments on student loans, McMahon defended President Donald Trump’s efforts to pare back the Education Department, saying she does not see what he’s doing as a “cut to education” but, rather, a means of reducing bureaucracy and empowering states to take the lead in their students’ education. 
During her speech, protesters outside the Eldorado Hotel could be heard shouting “Not for sale! Not for sale!” More than 1,000 people protested the budget reconciliation bill making its way through the United States Senate that would mandate the sale of up to 3 million acres of federal public lands.

Free.,Utah’s Mike Lee to make new attempt to sell off public lands in US Senate mega-bill,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/utahs-mike-lee-make-new-attempt-sell-public-lands-us-senate-mega-bill,,"U.S. Sen. Mike Lee says he will revamp his controversial proposal to require the sales of vast acres of federal lands in the West so it can be included in Senate Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending cut package.Lee will be seeking approval for his revised plan from the Senate parliamentarian, who will decide if the provision complies with the chamber’s strict rules for the fast-track procedure Republicans are using to pass their bill. An earlier version of Lee’s plan was dropped from the measure.Lee, a Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, wrote on X on Monday night that he would alter the proposal to include only Bureau of Land Management land within 5 miles of a population center and exempt U.S. Forest Service lands altogether.The amended version would also create “freedom zones” and protect “our farmers, ranchers, and recreational users,” Lee said.It was not immediately clear what either point would mean and legislative text of the proposal was not publicly available Tuesday. A spokesperson for the committee Lee leads did not return a message seeking comment Tuesday morning.The original version of the proposal would have mandated the sale of at least 2 million acres of BLM and Forest Service land in 11 Western states. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that language did not comply with the Senate’s rules for budget reconciliation, according to Senate Budget Committee ranking Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon.Budget reconciliation is the procedure Republicans are using to pass the package that contains most of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities, including extension of the 2017 tax cuts.The process allows passage with only a simple majority in the Senate instead of the usual 60 votes but comes with strict rules that every provision has a substantial impact on the federal deficit and relates to spending and taxes.Polarizing provisionLee’s social media post emphasized his goal was to expand housing supply by making public lands available for new construction.“Housing prices are crushing families and keeping young Americans from living where they grew up,” Lee wrote. “We need to change that.”Democrats and some Republicans from the affected states — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming — strongly opposed the measure, seeing it as a one-time sell-off of public lands used by hunters, hikers, ranchers and other users of public lands.The provision “would have gutted America’s public lands and auctioned them off to the highest bidder, in yet another bid to benefit the wealthy,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday.“Republicans tried to rip away hundreds of millions of acres of public land—not to help families, not to solve real problems—but to hand yet another gift to the wealthy and well-connected,” he added. “It was outrageous, it was shameless, and it would have forever changed the character of the country. Senate Democrats fought tooth and nail to keep public lands in public hands because these lands belong to everyone—not just the privileged few.”A similar provision was removed from the House’s version of the reconciliation bill in the face of heated opposition from Western Republicans led by Montana U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke.The former Interior secretary said last week he remained firmly opposed to the Senate version of the bill that included Lee’s proposal.“I have said from day one I would not support a bill that sells public lands,” he wrote on X. “I am still a no on the senate reconciliation bill that sells public lands. We did our job in the House. Let’s get it finished.”Other energy provisions strippedMerkley reported the Senate parliamentarian also ruled several other provisions of the Energy Committee’s section of the package to be out of compliance with the “Byrd Rule,” which governs what can be included in a reconciliation bill.Among the provisions the parliamentarian removed were items that would have waived environmental review requirements for offshore oil and gas development, mandated approval of a controversial mining road in Alaska, required annual lease sales for geothermal energy lease sales while changing how geothermal royalties are calculated and allowed natural gas exporters to pay a fee to have projects exempted from environmental requirements.Other provisions in the committee’s reconciliation instructions were still under review Tuesday, Merkley said.In a statement, Merkley said he would continue to lead Democrats’ campaign to strip provisions from the GOP bill.“Democrats will not stand idly by while Republicans attempt to circumvent the rules of reconciliation in order to sell off public lands to fund tax breaks for billionaires,” he said. “We will make sure the Byrd Rule is followed and review any changes Republicans attempt to make to the bill.”",,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality is now accepting applications for its Waste Tire Pilot Program. It offers up to $20,000 per recipient in funding for tire-related cleanup, enforcement and prevention initiatives to address what LDEQ says is a widespread problem across the state. 
Examples include:

Equipment purchases to support cleanup or prevention of illegal dumping;
Overtime or labor costs for parish or municipal staff handling collection or enforcement;
Site-specific cleanup of newly discovered illegal tire dump locations; and
Installation of barriers, signage or fencing to prevent future dumping.

LDEQ developed the program following a series of regional town halls the agency hosted last year to gain insights from local officials and residents across the state on how to address illegal tire dumping.
“This program reflects our commitment to practical, collaborative solutions for Louisiana’s environmental challenges,” LDEQ Secretary Courtney Burdette said in a news release. “We are proud to provide our local partners with tools that will help clean up communities, protect our environment and enhance public health in a meaningful way.”
Funding for the initiative comes from fees the state collects from companies that dispose and recycle waste tires.
To be considered for the Waste Tire Pilot Program, municipalities and parishes must submit a proposal by July 18 outlining how the funds would be used to address unauthorized waste tire disposal in their jurisdiction. Proposals can be emailed to Lewis.Donlon@la.gov or mailed to:
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services, P.O. Box 4313, Baton Rouge, LA 70821-4313. Attn: Dutch Donlon

(Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
South Dakota Legislature removes lawmaker addresses from website after Minnesota shootings 

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.










People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated. It's an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.


– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.

“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline) North Carolina fishermen abandoned their boats on Tuesday to walk the halls of the General Assembly and voice strong opposition to legislation that would ban inland shrimp trawling. House Bill 442, passed by the Senate last week, would prohibit trawlers from using their nets for shrimping in all inshore waters and within a half mile of the coast.
The original bill passed by the House in May dealt with strengthening the state’s flounder and red snapper stocks by regulating the harvest season and the number of fish that could be taken. The measure, however, was rewritten to address the shrimp trawling issue and quickly approved by the Senate last week.
Proponents of the revised bill, including the North Carolina Wildlife Federation, argue that large-scale shrimping nets kill hundreds of millions of juvenile fish and destroy vital seafloor habitats.
The Wildlife Federation has sent an email to over 1.5 million North Carolina license holders urging anglers to support the legislation.
Capt. John Mallette, co-owner of Southern Breeze Seafood Co. in Jacksonville, said those pushing the bill have offered no context or explained how it will damage the industry.

“The amendment for the shrimp trawl ban is baseless and full of lies,” Mallette told reporters at a Tuesday press conference.
Mallette said trawling has been going on for more than a century and fishing in the region remains sustainable.
“There’s still plenty of fish around. The shrimping is getting even better, even though the amount of shrimp has gone down.”
The Pamlico Sound accounts for 75% of the state’s shrimp landings. Closing that area to trawling would cripple the entire industry, according to Mallette.
The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission notes that North Carolina is the only state on the Atlantic or Gulf coast that continues to allow widescale trawling in inshore waters.
“There is no magic bullet that will restore depleted fisheries overnight, but reducing the impacts shrimp trawling has on the habitats that juvenile fish depend upon and limiting by-catch of those fish will make a difference,” explained the federation in an online message to its members.
Rep. Phil Shepard (R-Onslow) said the legislation was not just bad for commercial fishermen, but consumers who prize fresh seafood.
“I was born Down East, and I know the difference in a local shrimp and one that comes from Thailand or China.”
Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) — one of the legislature’s leading voices for environmental protection — also joined the chorus of voices opposing the trawling ban.
Senator Bobby Hanig, who represents ten coastal counties, has been fighting the ban in the upper chamber. Hanig called the Senate maneuver to pass the revised version of HB 442 “sleazy politics at its worst.”
  Rep. Keith Kidwell (Photo: NCGA)
Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Craven) said the bill would “flip the switch” on the economy in eastern North Carolina, harming not just the commercial fishermen, but all the supporting businesses.
“Are we going to shut down the people who live every day making an honest living because some branch of the government finally decides some slimy backroom deals that they don’t want to do this anymore?”
Kidwell said the bill would not advance in the state House on his watch.
“We’re going to spike this bill. And we’re going to drive a stake through its heart so it’s dead — because as you’ve noticed many times in this building, bills are like Freddy Krueger. Once you think they’re dead, they come back to life. This one’s going to die. It will be a swift, painful death.”
Kidwell also predicted House Bill 441 that would offer temporary “transition payments” to commercial fishermen impacted by the proposed trawling ban, would also fail as primary sponsors of the original bill have asked that their names be removed from the legislation.
“I’m going to beg everybody in this General Assembly. All my friends in the House and my enemies — Don’t sponsor a bill that’s going to kill an industry that supports the east coast of North Carolina. I’m not going to let it happen.”
The debate has grown increasingly bitter in recent days with authorities arresting a Brunswick County man for threatening to kill state lawmakers who would support the trawling ban.
The commercial shrimping industry in North Carolina is valued at more than $14 million per year.

Free.,GOP leaders in US Senate struggle to redo mega-bill by July Fourth deadline,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa, Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-leaders-us-senate-struggle-redo-mega-bill-july-fourth-deadline,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans were scrambling Tuesday to restructure several proposals in the “big, beautiful bill” that don’t meet their chamber’s strict rules for passing a reconciliation package, while GOP lawmakers on the other side of the Capitol warned those changes may doom its passage in the House.In one major development, the Senate parliamentarian ruled Monday that a controversial provision championed by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Mike Lee to mandate the sale of at least 2 million acres of public lands in 11 Western states did not comply with the chamber’s rules for reconciliation.Lee, a Utah Republican, has said the provision would free up land to build new housing. But Democrats and some Republicans from the affected states strongly opposed it.Lee said on social media Monday evening that he was working to rewrite the proposal to comply with reconciliation rules. A spokesperson for his office did not return a message seeking comment Tuesday morning.SNAP cost-sharing with states back in billIn another turn of events, Senate Agriculture Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., announced the panel successfully reworked a provision that would transfer some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to state governments. The parliamentarian ruled over the weekend an earlier proposal wasn’t compliant with the rules.“Our commonsense approach encourages states to adopt better practices, reduce error rates, be better stewards of taxpayer dollars, and prioritize the resources for those who truly need it,” Boozman wrote in a statement.The new language will give states the option of selecting fiscal year 2025 or 2026 as the year that the federal government uses to determine its payment error rate for SNAP, which will then impact how much of the cost the state has to cover starting in fiscal year 2028. Afterward, a state's payment error rate will be calculated using the last three fiscal years.Any state with an error rate higher than 6% will have to cover a certain percentage of the cost of the nutrition program for lower income households. Rushing toward deadlineThe internal debates among lawmakers about how to rewrite major pieces of the tax and spending cuts package have led to a rushed feeling among Republican leaders, who have repeatedly promised to approve the final bill before the Fourth of July — an exceedingly tight timeline.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said during a press conference shortly after a closed-door House GOP conference meeting Tuesday that he’s hopeful the final bill that comes out of the Senate won’t make too many changes to what the House approved earlier this year.“I remain very optimistic that there's not going to be a wide chasm between the two products — what the Senate produces and what we produce,” Johnson said. “We all know what the touchpoints are and the areas of greatest concern.”

Republicans, he said, know they need to focus on preserving a fragile compromise on the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, that helps offset the cost of living in some higher-tax states like California, New Jersey and New York.A deal Johnson brokered with GOP lawmakers in the SALT Caucus has been significantly rewritten in the Senate, but is expected to move back toward the House version, though not entirely.Johnson also mentioned GOP efforts to roll back certain clean-energy provisions that Democrats approved and President Joe Biden signed into law in their signature climate change, health care and tax package, called the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, in 2022.“We’ve got to get the SALT negotiation number right. We’ve got to make sure the IRA subsidies are handled in an appropriate manner,” Johnson said. “Look, you’ve got a number of provisions.”Johnson said he expects the Senate to vote on its final bill by Friday or Saturday and that he’s told House lawmakers to “keep your schedules flexible” on being in Washington, D.C., for a final House vote. Trump goads RepublicansPresident Donald Trump sought to spur quick approval of a final bill, posting on social media that GOP lawmakers should get the package to him as soon as possible.“To my friends in the Senate, lock yourself in a room if you must, don’t go home, and GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK. Work with the House so they can pick it up, and pass it, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Tuesday. “NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT’S DONE. Everyone, most importantly the American People, will be much better off thanks to our work together. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said there are concerns among his fellow Republicans about all of the provisions that must be removed or significantly reworked to meet the complex rules for moving a reconciliation bill through that chamber. For example, while it is being redone in hopes of adding it back in, language was removed that would have transferred some of the cost of running the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to state governments, potentially leaving states on the hook for billions in added spending on the food aid program for lower-income people.

“Every time something comes out that we're using as a pay for, it takes the deficit reduction down. And they've taken out nearly $300 billion so far. We've got to make that up,” Mullin said after leaving the closed-door House GOP meeting. “The Senate can't come in below the House version as far as deficit reduction. So that makes it difficult.”Mullin, who has been acting as his chamber's top negotiator with SALT Republicans in the House, told reporters he expects the deduction for state and local taxes to remain at the $40,000 level negotiated in the House. But said the Senate will likely rewrite the $500,000 income ceiling to qualify for the tax deduction.“I think 40 is a number we're going to land on,” Mullin said. “It's the income threshold that's in negotiations.”The ‘red line’ in the HouseNew York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler told reporters following the closed-door meeting that Senate leaders shouldn’t assume whatever they pass will be accepted by the House.“I've been very clear about where my red line is. So, you know, we'll let this process play out,” Lawler said. “I think the Senate should recognize the only number that matters is 218, and 50 plus 1. That's it. And how do you get there?”Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, so leadership cannot lose more than four votes and still approve the package, given that Democrats are universally opposed.

In the House, GOP leaders have 220 seats and need nearly every one of their members to support whatever the Senate sends back across the Capitol for it to make it to the president’s desk before their self-imposed deadline.In addition to the SALT tax compromise, Lawler said he has concerns about how the Senate has changed other provisions, including those addressing Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income people.“Yeah, there are a number of concerns about decisions that they're making,” Lawler said. “And obviously, the bill on their side is not final, so we’ll see where it goes.”Missouri Republican Rep.

,DC,2025-06-24 17:35:48+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,GOP leaders in US Senate struggle to lessen pain of Medicaid cuts for rural hospitals,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa, Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-leaders-us-senate-struggle-lessen-pain-medicaid-cuts-rural-hospitals,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans were scrambling Tuesday to restructure several proposals in the “big, beautiful bill” that don’t meet their chamber’s strict rules for passing a reconciliation package, while GOP lawmakers on the other side of the Capitol warned those changes may doom its passage in the House.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he and several others are working on a way to bolster rural hospitals, which could experience financial strain as a result of the various changes to Medicaid and other health care programs in the package.""We are working on a solution for rural hospitals and that's something that's been in the works now for several days in response to a number of concerns that our colleagues have mentioned in ensuring that the impact on rural hospitals be lessened, be mitigated,” Thune said. “And I think we're making good headway on that solution.""Thune said GOP lawmakers shouldn't let the ""perfect be the enemy of the good,” though he predicted there ""could be"" two or three Republicans who vote against the package.""We've got a lot of very independent-thinking senators who have reasons and things that they'd like to have in this bill that, in their view, would make it stronger,” Thune said. “But at the end of the day this is a process whereby not everybody is going to get what they want. And we have to get to 51 in the United States Senate.""More objections to Medicaid cutsMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who has been vocal about Medicaid changes and rural hospitals, said he had “no details whatsoever” about the rural hospital fund or how it would work if it’s added to the bill.But he said he’s not going to support a bill that takes away working people’s health care.""We've got 1.3 million people on Medicaid in Missouri, hundreds of thousands of kids. That's 21% of my population. Most of these people are working people. They're on Medicaid, not because they're sitting around at home; they're on Medicaid because they don't have a job that gives them health care and they cannot afford to buy it on the exchange,"" Hawley said. ""They don't want to be, but it's their only option. And I just think it's wrong to take away health care coverage from those folks. Now if they're not working, then sure, they should be.""Senate Republican Policy Committee Chair Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she had a “lengthy discussion” with her home state’s hospital association earlier in the day.“This has a lot of impacts and we want to make sure we have a lot of rural hospitals. That's why this rural hospital fund idea is developing,” Capito said. “I don’t think anything is set yet but that is an issue. I think Medicaid, we need to preserve it for the people it’s intended for and get rid of the people who don’t deserve it and don’t qualify and are bilking the system.”Capito said she hadn’t yet formed an opinion on the rural hospital fund since there isn’t yet a formal proposal written down.Public landsIn one major development, the Senate parliamentarian ruled Monday that a controversial provision championed by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Mike Lee to mandate the sale of at least 2 million acres of public lands in 11 Western states did not comply with the chamber’s rules for reconciliation.Lee, a Utah Republican, has said the provision would free up land to build new housing. But Democrats and some Republicans from the affected states strongly opposed it.Lee said on social media Monday evening that he was working to rewrite the proposal to comply with reconciliation rules. A spokesperson for his office did not return a message seeking comment Tuesday morning.SNAP cost-sharing under debateIn another turn of events, Senate Agriculture Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., earlier Tuesday had announced the panel successfully reworked a provision that would transfer some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to state governments.But a spokesperson for the panel said later that the parliamentarian actually has not yet made a ruling. The spokesperson said “we’ve gotten some clarification from leadership and it’s steering in the direction it would be compliant but not official.”Boozman earlier had said his proposal would improve SNAP. “Our commonsense approach encourages states to adopt better practices, reduce error rates, be better stewards of taxpayer dollars, and prioritize the resources for those who truly need it,” Boozman wrote in a statement.The new language, if accepted, would give states the option of selecting fiscal year 2025 or 2026 as the year that the federal government uses to determine its payment error rate for SNAP, which will then impact how much of the cost the state has to cover starting in fiscal year 2028. Afterward, a state's payment error rate will be calculated using the last three fiscal years.Any state with an error rate higher than 6% will have to cover a certain percentage of the cost of the nutrition program for lower income households.Rushing toward deadlineThe internal debates among lawmakers about how to rewrite major pieces of the tax and spending cuts package have led to a rushed feeling among Republican leaders, who have repeatedly promised to approve the final bill before the Fourth of July — an exceedingly tight timeline.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said during a press conference shortly after a closed-door House GOP conference meeting Tuesday that he’s hopeful the final bill that comes out of the Senate won’t make too many changes to what the House approved earlier this year.“I remain very optimistic that there's not going to be a wide chasm between the two products — what the Senate produces and what we produce,” Johnson said. “We all know what the touchpoints are and the areas of greatest concern.”

Republicans, he said, know they need to focus on preserving a fragile compromise on the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, that helps offset the cost of living in some higher-tax states like California, New Jersey and New York.A deal Johnson brokered with GOP lawmakers in the SALT Caucus has been significantly rewritten in the Senate, but is expected to move back toward the House version, though not entirely.Johnson also mentioned GOP efforts to roll back certain clean-energy provisions that Democrats approved and President Joe Biden signed into law in their signature climate change, health care and tax package, called the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, in 2022.“We’ve got to get the SALT negotiation number right. We’ve got to make sure the IRA subsidies are handled in an appropriate manner,” Johnson said. “Look, you’ve got a number of provisions.”Johnson said he expects the Senate to vote on its final bill by Friday or Saturday and that he’s told House lawmakers to “keep your schedules flexible” on being in Washington, D.C., for a final House vote. Trump goads RepublicansPresident Donald Trump sought to spur quick approval of a final bill, posting on social media that GOP lawmakers should get the package to him as soon as possible.“To my friends in the Senate, lock yourself in a room if you must, don’t go home, and GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK. Work with the House so they can pick it up, and pass it, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Tuesday. “NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT’S DONE. Everyone, most importantly the American People, will be much better off thanks to our work together. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said there are concerns among his fellow Republicans about all of the provisions that must be removed or significantly reworked to meet the complex rules for moving a reconciliation bill through that chamber.“Every time something comes out that we're using as a pay for, it takes the deficit reduction down. And they've taken out nearly $300 billion so far. We've got to make that up,” Mullin said after leaving the closed-door House GOP meeting. “The Senate can't come in below the House version as far as deficit reduction. So that makes it difficult.”

Mullin, who has been acting as his chamber's top negotiator with SALT Republicans in the House, told reporters he expects the deduction for state and local taxes to remain at the $40,000 level negotiated in the House. But said the Senate will likely rewrite the $500,000 income ceiling to qualify for the tax deduction.“I think 40 is a number we're going to land on,” Mullin said. “It's the income threshold that's in negotiations.”Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said ""most of us would like to make it zero.""""I hate the idea of $40,000 but if that's what it takes to pass the bill, I probably could do it. I would like to maybe find some other tweaks to it, somehow, like changing the income levels,"" he said.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he expects a resolution on SALT in the next 24 to 48 hours.“I had a very successful lunch meeting with the senators. I think that we are on track,” Bessent said.The ‘red line’ in the HouseNew York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler told reporters following the closed-door meeting that Senate leaders shouldn’t assume whatever they pass will be accepted by the House.“I've been very clear about where my red line is. So, you know, we'll let this process play out,” Lawler said. “I think the Senate should recognize the only number that matters is 218, and 50 plus 1. That's it. And how do you get there?”Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, so leadership cannot lose more than four votes and still approve the package, given that Democrats are universally opposed.In the House, GOP leaders have 220 seats and need nearly every one of their members to support whatever the Senate sends back across the Capitol for it to make it to the president’s desk before their self-imposed deadline.

In addition to the SALT tax compromise, Lawler said he has concerns about how the Senate has changed other provisions, including those addressing Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income people.“Yeah, there are a number of concerns about decisions that they're making,” Lawler said. “And obviously, the bill on their side is not final, so we’ll see where it goes.”Missouri Republican Rep.

Jim Justice told reporters that it’s important for the Senate to take its time in its changes to the reconciliation package and that GOP lawmakers need to be patient.“If you’re walking through the woods and you look right over there at that wall and there’s a rattlesnake all curled up there and everything, what do you do?” Justice asked. “Most people just jump and take off runnin’, well … rattlesnakes run in pairs and if you just jump left or right or behind, that one can hurt you right there.”Rattlesnakes are typically solitary creatures, but new research has shown that rattlesnakes are more social than previously thought.Justice said the best course of action when dealing with a rattlesnake, or two, is to stand still for a moment.“Look to the left, look to the right, look behind you, and then decide which way you're going,” he said. “That's what I think we need to do (in the Senate).”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capitol Dispatch)Several dozen people gathered last Saturday in Monticello for a citizen workshop the Grassroots Iowa Network organized to get more everyday Iowans engaged in the political process.
They spent the day listening to speakers* and exchanging ideas and observations, without fear or reprisal. They lunched and learned.
Former officeholders and current office-seekers were there, too. So were people who have spent countless hours working on issues or on behalf of candidates.
Although there were no knee britches or tri-corner hats in sight, our nation’s Founders were there in spirit. The Founders would take comfort knowing those Iowans were exercising liberties so important that they stitched them into our Constitution in the First Amendment — the rights to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, the right to assemble peaceably, and the right to petition our government for a redress of grievances.
Throughout our nation’s history, people have exercised those rights with passion and vigor. We saw that a week ago when hundreds of people gathered on the grounds of the Iowa Capitol. We saw that in recent weeks when people gathered outside courthouses, federal buildings and in other public spaces from Alaska to Florida and from Maine to Hawaii.
Their cause is unimportant to the broader point, because increasingly when people exercise their First Amendment freedoms, others quickly label them in negative ways because they disagree with the viewpoints being expressed.
Even so, those neighbors who march peaceably do not hate the United States. They are not leftist Commies or right-wing nut jobs. They are not hell-bent on destroying our nation.
Just like the colonialists of 250 years ago, the people marching through the streets of America these days do so to express their dissatisfaction with the course the nation is taking. These people are willing to express their disappointment when government ignores, harasses or arrests people for what they think, how they look or what they say.
For me, it is a time we again should celebrate those who march in America, or meet in Monticello, as the patriots they are. They deserve our respect, just as we revere the women and men in our military who defend our nation, all it stands for, and its core ideals that they fight to protect, including the right to think and speak in support of a cause, or the right to voice their dissent.
History supports this.
For most of our nation’s life, being a patriot did not mean you came only from one side. There were Revolutionaries, Continentals, Populists, Whigs, Agrarians and even contrarians, and each group walked the patriot walk and talked the patriot talk in their own way.
So, let’s encourage more citizen roundtables and community marches, because they provide one measure of hope that our nation still stands solid and that better days will come.
Let’s hope Iowans who are Republicans, Democrats, independents, political agnostics, and maybe even a Whig or two, can gather and talk about facts and ideas, policies and problems, solutions and challenges — all without resorting to the name-calling that spews from some politicians.
Let’s make it so words like morons, lunatics, scum, losers, traitors, crooks get left on the elementary school playground. Our country does not benefit from such name-calling.
But Iowa can benefit from a renewed energy of engagement. We need people’s ideas. We need people who will step out of their comfort zone and respectfully disagree with the direction of our state and our nation. We need people who will stand up and demand answers from political candidates and especially from those already in office.
It does not matter who started this war of words. We must return to the civility that used to be a hallmark of our political discourse, when political leaders traded ideas, not insults. Nowadays, politicians scramble like Caitlin Clark with the basketball, except these leaders fall all over themselves to avoid answering questions.
Bipartisan carpool
A shining example illustrating the change in civility and our political dialogue occurred 53 years ago in a car traveling from Washington, D.C., to Iowa.
  Neal Smith and John Kyl, two Iowa Nice rivals. (Official U.S. House portraits)
It was in the summer of 1972. Congressional redistricting after the census had thrown two incumbent members of the U.S. House into the same newly drawn congressional district. One was Democrat Neal Smith of Altoona, and the other was Republican John Kyl of Bloomfield.
These two Washington veterans were campaigning against each other. One would win, and the other would be out of a job. That summer, their wives wanted to escape the summer heat in Washington and get home to Iowa.
The way they did that is memorable — and a lesson for all of us. Their example of civility gets at the heart of Iowa values and respect for those with whom we may disagree on politics, but with whom we probably agree on many other matters.
Think about this: Bea Smith and Arlene Kyl traversed half a continent by carpooling with each other.
I am not suggesting we must suppress our differences of opinions. Far from that. But it costs us nothing to treat those with whom we disagree as decent human beings, as neighbors and as potential friends.
We all need to do our part to restore civility to our political discourse. That applies to us as voters. It most assuredly applies to those we elect to lead us.
And, most of all, we need it to remain patriots ourselves.

(Photo by Oregon Department of Agriculture)Farmworkers in Maine may have gained the right to state minimum wage this legislative session, but they still won’t be protected from retaliation for talking about work conditions.
Late last week, Gov. Janet Mills vetoed LD 588, which would have offered agricultural workers in the state that right. In her veto letter, Mills noted that the bill is similar to a measure she rejected last year and her thinking has not changed on the issue. 
“Because the bill is unchanged, so too is my veto letter,” she said. 
Her letter goes on to say that the legislation would create a complicated legal framework that would add to the burden farmers are already facing with increased severe weather, toxic chemical contamination on their lands, price pressures and more. 
The Maine Legislature will have the opportunity to overturn Mills’ veto; however, it will require support from at least two-thirds of lawmakers. The House of Representatives initially rejected the bill, but narrowly decided to change course and join the upper chamber in passing the measure.
Given those existing challenges, Mills said she could not “subject our farmers to a complicated new set of labor laws that will require a lawyer just to understand.” She also added that Maine’s agricultural sector is largely made up of small farms that treat workers well in order to retain them.
Proponents of the bill, including the left-leaning Maine Center for Economic Policy, saw LD 588 as a chance to right a historic wrong. Though most other workers are protected from retaliation when speaking about working conditions, farmworkers have long been excluded because those roles were historically filled by Black workers, wrote Arthur Phillips, an economic policy analyst, in a blog post after the veto.
“While we celebrate the farmworker minimum wage and lament the governor’s veto of the concerted activity bill, we also recognize these are pieces of a long, ongoing fight for economic and racial justice in Maine,” Phillips added.

The appellate judges said Monday a jury ought to determine whether excessive force was applied in the death of Cedric Lofton, 17, in 2021. (Greenleaf123/Getty Images)TOPEKA — A panel of U.S. Court of Appeals judges agreed with a lower court that Sedgwick County juvenile detention personnel couldn’t sidestep an excessive-force lawsuit filed against them after a teenager in mental distress was held in a face-down restraint until he suffered cardiac arrest and later died.
In September 2021, Cedric Lofton, 17, became unresponsive while restrained by five officers at the Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center. He had been placed in a prone position, which means face down, on a holding cell floor for nearly 40 minutes with officers’ weight applied to his back. Lofton was resuscitated after an officer noticed he wasn’t breathing. He never regained consciousness and died two days later at a hospital, the court record says.
Court of Appeals Judges Richard Federico, Carolyn McHugh and Allison Eid of the 10th Circuit affirmed the district court ruling declaring the corrections officers weren’t entitled to qualified immunity or summary judgment in the suit filed by Lofton’s estate.
“A reasonable officer would have been on notice that continued application of pressure after Mr. Lofton was subdued created a serious risk of asphyxiation and death, even if he was still verbalizing threats,” the three-judge panel said in a decision released Monday. “Under those circumstances, it is clearly established that a continued prone restraint is unconstitutional.”
Before the involvement of Wichita law enforcement officers, the court record says, Lofton was taken by a foster parent to a clinic for a mental health evaluation. Lofton ran away from the facility but later returned home. On advice of the Kansas Department for Children and Families, the court record says, foster parent Tanea Randolph called Wichita police.
Wichita police officers said Lofton was hallucinating, and the decision was made to transport him to St. Joseph’s Hospital for involuntary hospitalization. A struggle ensued outside the foster home, and Lofton was arrested for battery of an officer.
Lofton was taken to the Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center, where he engaged in physical altercations with corrections officers. In view of surveillance cameras, five Sedgwick County juvenile officers held the 135-pound Lofton in a prone position for nearly 40 minutes until he suffered a heart attack. He was revived by officers before being transported to Wesley Medical Center, where he subsequently died.
An autopsy indicated the death — ruled a homicide — was associated with complications of cardiopulmonary arrest amid a physical struggle and while held in a prone position, court documents said.
Lofton’s brother, Marquan Teetz, filed a federal lawsuit in 2022 alleging personnel at the juvenile facility engaged in excessive force. Attorneys for the officers sought dismissal of their clients from the case based on the premise the officers were shielded from liability for constitutional acts.
Eric Melgren, chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Kansas and an appointee of President George W. Bush, denied the motion and concluded surveillance footage could support Teetz’ claim that excessive force was sustained after Lofton stopped resisting. The judge said a jury ought to decide whether officers conducted themselves within constitutional boundaries or relied on unconstitutional force.
On appeal, lawyers for the officers asked the U.S. Court of Appeals to reverse the district court judge. Defense counsel Jeffrey Kuhlman argued Lofton wouldn’t have died if he hadn’t resisted commands of officers in a manner that resulted in exposure to “an air deficit.”
Inside the juvenile facility, Lofton allegedly punched a corrections officer in the face and held another in a chokehold before being restrained by defendants Jason Stepien, Brenton Newby, Karen Conklin, William Buckner and Benito Mendoza. Conklin performed CPR on Lofton before his transfer to a hospital.
The three-judge panel said it was reasonable to conclude there were circumstances in which application of pressure to a subdued person’s back while in a prone position on a solid surface was excessive.
“This may include situations where the suspect continues to resist to some degree, physically or verbally, but no longer poses a risk of serious harm or injury due to the restraints,” the panel said.
McHugh, an appointee of President Barack Obama, wrote in the opinion that the district court calculated Lofton was not “meaningfully resisting” correction officers for at least 12 minutes while held in the prone restraint.
“Defendants had sufficient control over him,” she wrote. “At that point, a reasonable officer would have perceived the threat had passed and that the use of deadly force was no longer reasonable. Instead, five officers continued to subject Mr. Lofton to a prone restraint while his legs were restrained and he appeared not to move for prolonged periods.”
McHugh added: “We therefore conclude defendants violated Mr. Lofton’s Fourth Amendment rights not just by using excessive force, but by using deadly force well past the point a reasonable officer would have perceived any serious threat to his physical safety had passed.”
During the episode at the juvenile detention facility in Wichita, Lofton was in temporary custody of the facility. The Wichita Police Department retained legal custody of the teenager. Lofton apparently went into cardiac arrest while juvenile officers were attempting to contact Wichita police to request they retrieve him.
In addition to the five corrections officers, defendants in the lawsuit include the Sedgwick County Commission and the city of Wichita.
In 2022, Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett declined to file criminal charges in the Lofton case. He said corrections officers acted in self defense and that “these folks are protected by Kansas law.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1483489085-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 13:25:32.597533

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Library records in New Hampshire are currently confidential under state law, but a bill being considered by the state Legislature could carve out an exception for parents.
House Bill 273, if passed, would mandate public libraries make kids’ borrowing histories available to their parents upon request. That bill, which went through the committee of conference process last week, is scheduled for a vote of the full House and Senate Thursday. The bill is sponsored by Rep. Mike Drago, a Raymond Republican. If both chambers approve it Thursday, the bill will head to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk, where she will have the option to sign it into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without her signature.
Drago, introducing the bill in April, said the “elephant in the room” is “the inappropriate material that makes its way into our libraries these days.”
“That debate isn’t going to be solved today or tomorrow on what’s appropriate for who,” he continued. “But I think it’s more important than ever to at least have parents have access to their child’s library records, so they can help decide what’s appropriate and what’s not.”
The bill has already been approved by both the House and Senate, though each chamber voted for a different effective date. Last week, negotiators in a committee of conference hashed out their differences and decided the bill would be effective Jan. 1. They’ll now take the newly amended bill to the full chamber.
The bill comes amid a number of so-called parental rights bills in the Legislature this year that seek to give parents even more access to information about their children. Earlier this month, Ayotte signed House Bill 10 into law. That bill guarantees New Hampshire parents the right to ask school personnel for any information about what their child is doing at school and get complete disclosure. This was criticized by LGBTQ+ advocates worried that it would force teachers to out young gay or trans kids. The bill also enshrines into state law parents’ right to opt their child out of sex ed, exempt their child from vaccine requirements with a doctor’s note or because of religious belief, and home school their child, among other things. Many of these actions were already allowed, but the new law reaffirms them. It also creates new requirements of school boards to create policies promoting parental involvement in a child’s education.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/libaryprivacy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 13:25:32.597533

Out-of-state doctors are pushing for laws that will make it harder to detect who prescribes and sends abortion medication, as anti-abortion lawmakers look for ways to stop the flow of pills to their states.
Patients have continued to receive abortion pills in states with near-total bans, so much so that the number of abortions has actually increased since the fall of Roe v. Wade, despite near-total abortion bans. This is mostly thanks to “shield laws.” Working from states like New York, California and Massachusetts, providers meet virtually with pregnant patients in states with bans and write them abortion pill prescriptions. Patients receive the pills in the mail to take from home. One in 5 abortions are now done through telehealth, according to the Society of Family Planning, and about half of those are for people getting care because of shield laws.
Now, doctors are working to anonymize that process by pushing to hide the name of the prescriber from the labels of mifepristone and misoprostol — the two drugs used in medication abortions. The effort marks a new step in the escalating battle between states over whether and how people in America can get abortions — and to what extent individual states’ laws can influence medical care coming from another.

“We are seeing two very different worlds right now in the United States in terms of the directions of laws and policies,” said Dr. Angel Foster, who provides telehealth abortions from Massachusetts to people in states with bans. “Shield law states are doing more to not only protect reproductive rights within their own state, but to protect avenues for all abortion seekers in the country to be able to get safe and legal care.”
Typically, prescription bottles include information such as the name of the doctor who prescribed medication, details about the medication and appropriate dosage, and the name of the patient receiving medication. But that information has become invaluable in civil and criminal cases filed by anti-abortion law enforcement officers.
A handful of states — New York, Maine, Vermont and Washington — have already passed laws to remove prescriber names from abortion pill bottles. Proposed legislation in Massachusetts, currently working through the state Senate, would similarly allow this change, although at least one shield law practice in the state, Foster’s Massachusetts Medication Abortion Project, has already removed prescribing doctors’ names from pill bottles citing guidance they received from the state attorney general.
A proposal in California, the largest shield law state, would go a step further. The bill, currently making its way through the state Senate, would remove not only the name of the prescribing health care provider but also the patient receiving medication. Proponents say that could protect patients who are concerned about someone discovering they ordered abortion pills.
The legislative trend comes as abortion opponents are ramping up efforts to stop telehealth abortion. Both Texas and Louisiana’s attorneys general have pushed criminal and civil cases targeting Dr. Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based physician who allegedly prescribed abortion pills to patients in those states. The cases pose a first test of shield laws and are likely to ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
The Texas suit against Carpenter was filed after a pregnant woman in the state developed bleeding and went to the hospital, according to court filings from the state. The filings assert that the “biological father of the unborn child” found medications that appeared to be prescribed by Carpenter.
“If an abusive partner were to find a package of abortion pills in the trash can, if it says Dr. XYZ, already you have someone to name in a lawsuit,” said Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has advised state lawmakers on crafting shield laws. “If it doesn’t have it, it’s a critical piece of information. How do you know who prescribed the pills?”
Separately, legislators in Texas unsuccessfully sought to end telehealth prescriptions with a bill, which died in the legislature, that would have allowed anyone to sue people who prescribe or send abortion pills to Texans for at least $100,000. Louisiana lawmakers are poised to pass legislation that would create similar punishment structures, allowing the “biological father,” his parents, or the parents of the pregnant person to file civil suits against out-of-state abortion providers.
Abortion rights supporters say that removing the doctor’s name from a prescription label would add security for those who rely on shield laws but are nervous about heightened efforts to target providers, a concern that has only grown since this weekend’s shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses. News outlets have reported that the suspected shooter, Vance Boelter, had a list of alleged targets in his car that included abortion providers.
“It goes a long way in ensuring that providers are protected at a time when we’ve seen increased violence and animus toward abortion providers and reproductive health providers generally,” said Lizzy Hinkley, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which worked to help pass such a bill in New York. “Anyone who has their name on a pill bottle will risk detection by hostile parties in states that have banned abortion.”
One California doctor who practices with telehealth practice A Safe Choice said he deliberately keeps a low profile. Only a few close friends know about his work providing abortions to people out-of-state. But through his organization, he hears almost once a week from other health care professionals who want to offer telehealth abortions to patients living under bans. He believes a bill like California’s could encourage even more to do so.
“Allowing the provision of services without the providers needing to put their name on the prescription labels will add an additional layer of security and confidence for the providers,” said the doctor, who asked that his name be withheld because of the ongoing legal threats against abortion providers. “This is a very important next step.”
The California bill could have an outsized impact. Most shield law prescriptions are filled by California-based pharmacies. That includes those called in by doctors who are practicing in other states, such as New York, but who don’t want to mail the pills themselves.
“There is no pharmacy in New York state that mails pills for us, so we have to rely on pharmacies in California,” said one physician in New York, who asked that her name be withheld because of the legal actions taken against Carpenter. “All the shield law providers across the country are waiting with bated breath for this bill to be passed.”
New York has passed a law removing prescriber names from abortion medication labels created in the state, she said, but that hasn’t affected her. Because she calls prescriptions into a pharmacy in California the labels are subject to the Golden State’s laws — and as a result, her name is still listed on the bottle when she orders abortion pills for out-of-state patients. Her patients live in states all over the country.
“It’s very stressful. I wish we could get California to move a bit faster,” she said.
The California bill has been approved by the state’s lower chamber but is still awaiting Senate passage. It’s faced little resistance and has received support from the state’s attorney general and lieutenant governor. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has built a public profile in part through vocal support of abortion protections, has not weighed in, and his office said he does not comment on pending legislation.
Still, there are legal questions about bills like California’s. Federal law requires that medication labels include the prescriber’s name — a stipulation that some argue could conflict with and possibly override the state-level protection.
But these questions haven’t been raised regarding other similar laws. Some legal scholars argued that the federal statute is ambiguous, and that pharmacies could say the state law still satisfies federal requirement by including the name of a medical practice — as New York’s and Maine’s do — rather than of an individual prescribing doctor or nurse.
“If you have the address and the practice and you’re able to easily identify where the prescription came from, that’s the purpose of this rule,” said Rachel Rebouché, dean of the Temple University School of Law. “The issue is being able to, for safety reasons and for monitoring, understand that someone who has the authority to do this has done it. There’s no question that putting the name of the practice does that.”
The blue-state push comes as abortion opponents have stepped up their efforts not only in individual states, but in their quest for national restrictions on mifepristone, calling for the federal government to prohibit dispensing it through telehealth.
That campaign has included building a body of research that they say highlights its potential risks — which runs against mainstream medical findings and that some researchers have said rely on “junk science.”
While President Donald Trump has remained quiet on abortion, members of his administration have suggested openness to curbing access to medication. This month, Food and Drug Commissioner Marty Makary committed to having his agency review mifepristone’s approval, though it’s not clear what that would ultimately mean. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he supports taking another look at the drug’s safety.
“In light of the situation at the FDA, it is urgent to ensure that California clinicians and pharmacists can prescribe and deliver mifepristone to the patients who rely on us,” Dr. Kelly Pfeifer, a California-based doctor who also provides abortions in Kansas, said at a committee hearing for the state’s bill. “This bill will allow us to continue to treat our patients even if politicians in Washington act against the science to further limit mifepristone.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/abortionpill2025-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-06-24 13:11:24.790161

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)As many Americans did, I awoke the morning of June 14 to horrific news from Minnesota: a man dressed as a police officer had murdered state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife multiple times, critically injuring them. 
After a two-day manhunt, the alleged killer, Vance Boelter was arrested. Based on his own notes and statements from friends, Boelter was a political conservative who had a “hit list” of Minnesota Democrats  — at the state and federal levels — and had been to the homes of two other officials the same night he shot the Hortmans and the Hoffmans.
Officials from other states began to respond almost immediately. 
South Dakota’s House Speaker and leaders of both the majority and minority parties signed off on a joint statement expressing their sorrow for the shootings. New Mexico lawmakers began to review security plans with law enforcement, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham publicly denounced the Minnesota violence. 
In North Dakota, legislative staff wiped lawmakers’ home addresses from state websites on Saturday. Pennsylvania legislative leaders — both Republicans and Democrats — publicly expressed condolences to the people of Minnesota, and House Speaker Joanna McClinton held a moment of silence mid-House session.
In Tennessee? If you were depending on our state officials to say, well, anything, and particularly anything dignified, you were out of luck. 
On Saturday, the House Democratic Caucus issued a statement on behalf of Chair John Ray Clemmons of Nashville. 
“We extend our love and sincere condolences to our fellow state legislators in Minnesota who were violently attacked, as well as their families and colleagues. We join them in their grief following today’s tragic events.”
“While we lack all the facts of these attacks, this incident should serve as a reminder of our duty, as public officials, not to abuse the power bestowed upon us or use our respective platforms to spread mis/disinformation and ignite divisive, dangerous political rhetoric. Such irresponsible conduct benefits no one and threatens all,” read the statement.
But from either the House or Senate Republican Caucus or the Senate Democrat Caucus, nothing. Speaker of the House Cameron Sexton? Only the sound of silence. And Gov. Bill Lee? Crickets. 

Senator, your woke agenda comes from some proper mental health issues.

Apparently, state lawmakers preferred to do most of their talking on social media — a medium not known for tamping down public discourse but for fanning the flames of discord. 
Democratic Sen. Heidi Campbell of Nashville posted an ABC News clip on X the morning of the Minnesota shootings, with the comment: “This is where MAGA hate has brought us.” 
House Republican Caucus Chair Jeremy Faison of Cosby responded by accusing Campbell of being mentally ill. 
“Senator, your woke agenda comes from some proper mental health issues,” Faison wrote. “The shooter is you, your mentality, desire, political affiliation, and passion.”
Deputy House Speaker Jason Zachary, a Knoxville Republican, posted, “Senator, it is unfortunate that you would choose to politicize such a terrible tragedy without any facts. In fact, the suspect is a @GovTimWalz appointee. You both need to step back.”
“Prayers for the victims and families. No place for this in our country.”
House Majority Leader William Lamberth declined to jump into the fray, sticking to retweeting his members’ posts. 
A couple of Democratic senators — Nashville’s Jeff Yarbro posted on X, “Whatever is happening right now in this country must stop. And we have to do everything in our power to stop it,” while Charlane Oliver, also of Nashville, posted on Threads — offered condolences and criticized the current political tenor in the U.S. 
Politicians have always chosen fighting words for public speeches, using phrases like “putting a target” on someone or even “kicking a**.”
But there’s no question that political rhetoric inciting violence is, if not at an all-time high, at least at a high mark for the last 60 years or so, and President Donald Trump has been a chief instigator, suggesting hecklers at rallies be “roughed up,” calling Democrats the “enemy within,” saying they are more dangerous than foreign adversaries and defending the violent insurrectionists who rioted at the U.S. Capitol in January 2021. 
There are many Americans who shrug at these comments, and whether they are meant literally or figuratively is beside the point, for it’s clear people like Boelter take incitement to violence to heart. 
Man arrested, charged with stalking Memphis Mayor Paul Young

Just Wednesday, a man was arrested in Memphis and charged with stalking and criminal trespassing after jumping a wall at Memphis Mayor Paul Young’s subdivision. The man had a taser, rope and duct tape when he was apprehended and told police he was “angry” at Young. 
We may never know if political rhetoric played a role: in May, FBI Director Kash Patel called Memphis the “homicide capital of the world” and state lawmakers have used denigrating terms to describe Memphis and its institutions. 
Thank God Young and his family are safe and that Memphis didn’t make headlines for another unspeakable tragedy like the one in Minnesota. 
Thus far, I’ve seen no snarky comments on social media about the Memphis incident, but neither have I seen expressions of alarm or public pronouncements from state lawmakers. 
It’s not enough to just not be snarky. In the wake of the shooting and murders in Minnesota, Tennessee cries for leaders who will speak and act boldly to throw water on the flames of hateful speech; mere talk of “civility” isn’t enough, either. Addressing what is clearly a serious issue is incumbent on both Republican and Democratic leaders.
Or, one day, Tennessee could find ourselves mourning the way Minnesotans are this week. And by then, action will be too late.

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)In a 5-2 ruling on Tuesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the Department of Natural Resources’ (DNR) authority to regulate polluters of hazardous substances such as PFAS through the state’s toxic spills law. 
The court’s ruling reverses the decisions of the circuit and appeals courts that could have threatened the DNR’s ability to force polluters to pay for the environmental damage they cause. For more than 40 years, the spills law has allowed the DNR to bring civil charges and enforce remediation measures against parties responsible for spills of “harmful substances.” 
The lawsuit was brought by an Oconomowoc dry cleaner and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce (WMC), the state’s largest business lobby, after the owner of the dry cleaner, Leather Rich Inc., found PFAS on her property. 
In preparation to sell the business, Leather Rich had been participating in a voluntary DNR program to remediate contamination on its property in exchange for a certificate of liability protection from the department. During that process, the DNR determined that PFAS should be considered a “hazardous substance” under the spills law and communicated that on its website. 
If PFAS were present on a site, the DNR stated, participants in the voluntary program would only be eligible for partial liability protection. 
While conducting a site investigation through the program, Leather Rich determined three of four wells on the property exceeded Department of Health Services standards for PFAS concentration in surface or drinking water. The DNR requested that future reports from Leather Rich to the department include the amount of PFAS found on the property. Leather Rich responded by withdrawing from the program and filing suit. 
At the circuit and appeals courts, Leather Rich was successful, with judges at each level finding that the decision by the DNR to start considering PFAS a “hazardous substance” under the spills law constituted an “unpromulgated rule” and therefore was against the law. That interpretation would have required the DNR to undergo the complicated and often yearslong process of creating an administrative rule each time it determines that a substance is harmful to people or the environment. 
SpillsLawDecision
In the majority opinion, authored by Justice Janet Protasiewicz and joined by the Court’s three other liberal leaning justices and conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn, the Court found that the DNR spent nearly 50 years administering the spills law responding “to about 1,000 spills each year, without promulgating rules listing substances, quantities, and concentrations that it deems ‘hazardous substances.’”
Protasiewicz wrote that when the Legislature wrote the spills law, it left the definition of “hazardous substance” intentionally open-ended but required a potentially harmful substance to meet certain criteria if it would apply under the law. 
“The definition of ‘hazardous substance’ is broad and open-ended in that it potentially applies to ‘any substance or combination of substances,’” Protasiewicz wrote. “But the definition is limited in that the substance or combination of substances must satisfy one of two fact-specific criteria.” 
She wrote that the law considers “a substance or combination of substances is ‘hazardous’ if,” its quantity, concentration or characteristics may cause or contribute to an increase in mortality or serious illness or may pose a potential hazard to human health or the environment
Leather Rich and WMC had argued that the Legislature’s failure to include chemical thresholds in the statutory text left while including the use of terms like “significantly,” “serious,” and “substantial,” meant that the law was ambiguous and therefore any DNR determinations of what counts as hazardous must be delineated in an administrative rule. They argued that under this interpretation of statute, spilling milk or beer on the ground could constitute a toxic spill. 
Protasiewicz wrote if that were the case, “then scores of Wisconsin statutes on a wide range of subjects would be called into doubt,” and that their hypotheticals are undermined by the text of the statute. 
“It is possible for an everyday substance like milk or beer to qualify as a ‘hazardous substance,’ but only if it first satisfies [the statute’s] fact specific criteria,” she wrote. “A mug of beer or a gallon of milk spilled into Lake Michigan may not ‘pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment,’ but a 500-gallon tank of beer or milk discharged into a trout stream might well pose a substantial present hazard to the stream’s fish and environment.” 
The majority opinion also found that communications the DNR made on its website and in letters to Leather Rich counted as “guidance documents” not as rules.
Justice Rebecca Grassl Bradley, who once gave a speech to WMC in which she declared to the business lobby that “I am your public servant,” wrote in a dissent joined by Chief Justice Annette Ziegler that the majority’s interpretation of the spills law left the state vulnerable to a “tyrannical” government that could both create the rules and enforce them. 
“This case is about whether the People are entitled to know what the law requires of them before the government can subject them to the regulatory wringer,” she wrote. “The majority leaves the People at the mercy of unelected bureaucrats empowered not only to enforce the rules, but to make them. Americans have lived under this unconstitutional arrangement for decades, but now, the majority says, the bureaucrats can impose rules and penalties on the governed without advance notice, oversight, or deliberation. In doing so, the majority violates three first principles fundamental to preserving the rule of law — and liberty.” 
After the decision’s release, Democrats and environmental groups celebrated its findings as an important step to protecting Wisconsin’s residents from the harmful effects of pollution. 
“This is a historic victory for the people of Wisconsin and my administration’s fight against PFAS and other harmful contaminants that are affecting families and communities across our state,” Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. “The Supreme Court’s decision today means that polluters will not have free rein to discharge harmful contaminants like PFAS into our land, water, and air without reporting it or taking responsibility for helping clean up those contaminants. It’s a great day for Wisconsinites and the work to protect and preserve our state’s valuable natural resources for future generations.”
But WMC said the Court’s interpretation leaves businesses guessing what substances count as hazardous under the law. 
“The DNR refuses to tell the regulated community which substances must be reported under the Spills Law, yet threatens severe penalties for getting it wrong,” Scott Manley, WMC’s Executive Vice President of Government Relations, said in a statement. “Businesses and homeowners are left to guess what’s hazardous, and if they’re wrong, they face crushing fines and endless, costly litigation. This ruling blesses a regulatory approach that is fundamentally unfair, unworkable, and impossible to comply with.”

(Photo illustration by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle; photos from IN.gov and Getty Images)An Indiana man who claims a Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) error cost him a job opportunity, over $1,000 in fines and a night in jail can’t sue for damages, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled Monday.
“This case requires us to determine whether the Legislature intended to confer on Indiana’s more than 4.5 million licensed drivers a right to sue the BMV when damages allegedly result from inaccurate records,” the decision said. “Though the Legislature often enacts statutes imposing duties on private persons and governmental entities alike, we recognize a private right of action only when a statute was intended to create one. And we will not infer such intent if a statute contains an independent enforcement mechanism or primarily protects the public at large.”
The ruling, written by Indiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush, said the General Assembly created a material error review process to correct inaccurate driving records — without awarding damages.
Chris Kelly, a Marion County resident, was pulled over in August 2020 for two “minor traffic infractions,” as outlined in a January 2023 complaint. A Marion County prosecutor twice sent SR16 records to the BMV to delete his related conviction and restore Kelly’s driving privileges around November of 2020 and February of 2021.

Still, law enforcement pulled Kelly over multiple times and the suspended license showed up on Kelly’s record, costing him a job for an outside sales position. Kelly reported paying more than $1,000 in tickets, at least 30 calls to the BMV alongside letters, emails and an in-person visit.
“(The BMV) breached the duty of care they are required to provide,” concluded Kelly’s complaint. “This has caused the plaintiff to not be able to work in his industry since 2020. Plaintiff cannot work in his field due to negligence of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.”
As summarized by his counsel, Daniel K. Burke told the Indiana Supreme Court in March that there is an implied right to sue in law. If there isn’t, he said Kelly has no remedy. But lawyers for the state urged dismissal of the case, as a trial court judge had done earlier. The Indiana Court of Appeals had ruled that Kelly qualified for judicial relief.
The court ruling said the legislature sometimes does create a private right of action to sue with very clear language, but that isn’t the situation here.
“We do not condone the BMV’s alleged failings in this case. But as we have never recognized a common-law duty in these circumstances and Kelly has not established one exists under the Webb test, we decline to find such a duty here. Kelly has therefore failed to show he has a legally actionable common-law negligence claim,” the majority of justices ruled.
Justice Christopher Goff wrote a dissenting opinion in which he said the statute imposes a duty on the BMV to maintain records for each “individual” licensed, suggesting it owes a duty to those individuals rather than the public in general.
“Despite repeated requests, the BMV failed to correct the error in Kelly’s driving record. This failure foreseeably caused Kelly harm, including a lost job opportunity. At this early stage, Kelly has alleged sufficient facts for his negligence case to proceed,” he said.

WILMINGTON— Veolia has opened one of the largest PFAS treatment plants in the United States at its Stanton Water Treatment facility, a $35 million project designed to deliver safer drinking water to more than 100,000 New Castle County residents.
The system is now removing regulated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from up to 30 million gallons of water per day, meeting federal limits 4 years ahead of the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2029 compliance deadline.
PFAS, often called “forever chemicals,” are found in consumer goods like nonstick cookware and firefighting foam. They have been linked to a range of serious health problems, including certain cancers, thyroid disease, and developmental issues in children. These chemicals can persist in the human body for years, prompting a nationwide push for stricter regulations.
“In line with our GreenUp strategic program, this major infrastructure milestone highlights Veolia’s strong commitment to delivering environmental security solutions to communities worldwide,” said Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO of Veolia. “For the 100,000 people who rely on high-quality water from Veolia in Delaware, the Stanton PFAS treatment system is a generational improvement in public health and environmental protection that will strengthen communities and create opportunities long into the future.”
The 17,600-square-foot facility houses 42 carbon-filled vessels — each 22 feet tall and containing 40,000 pounds of granular activated carbon. Water enters from two nearby sources, including the Red Clay Creek, where high levels of PFAS had previously been detected. Once through the filters, PFAS levels are reduced to non-detectable amounts.

Veolia began designing the system in early 2022. Construction was completed in under three years by installing the vessels first and then building the structure around them. A built-in laboratory enables Veolia to test new filtration materials and optimize treatment over time, providing flexibility as environmental standards evolve.
Currently operates 33 PFAS treatment facilities nationwide, Veolia plans to expand that number to over 100 through its “BeyondPFAS” initiative, providing water security to nearly 2 million Americans.

Governor Matt Meyer praised the project’s public health impact, particularly for households that cannot afford home filtration. 
“PFAS contamination poses a serious threat to public health, and addressing it at the source is essential,” he said. “The Stanton Water Treatment Plant will play a vital role in tackling this challenge… and underscores our administration’s dedication to ensuring clean, safe water for Delawareans.”
Veolia partnered with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) to evaluate sources of PFAS contamination. The company said about a third of its water supply comes from the Red Clay Creek, a site affected by legacy pollution. The exact source of contamination has not yet been determined.
The company has filed a request with the Delaware Public Service Commission for a 44% rate increase to help cover costs of the new system. If approved, the average residential water bill would rise by about $19 per month — from $40 to $59. Veolia has not said whether it will pursue legal action to recoup costs from chemical manufacturers, as some utilities have done.
Karine Rougé, CEO of Municipal Water for Veolia North America, said the Stanton plant represents a broader shift in how utilities respond to contamination.
“I’m inspired by how swiftly and effectively Veolia responded to the PFAS challenge in Delaware through this state-of-the-art facility, which now sets a global standard,” she said. “The lessons from this project will help Veolia deploy similar water quality improvements faster, more efficiently and more effectively.”
The EPA implemented new drinking water standards for PFAS last year, though it recently proposed giving providers more time to comply following legal challenges and concerns about treatment costs. Veolia’s early delivery may position Delaware as a national model in proactive compliance.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-24-at-11.41.06 AM-1-e1750782813693-1024x632.png,,,2025-06-24 13:11:24.790161

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)In a sweeping move aimed at promoting transparency and leveling the playing field in election access, the Virginia Department of Elections announced Monday that it will reduce the cost of purchasing voter lists by 90% starting next month.
The change dramatically lowers the price of essential voter data — including lists of registered voters, new registrants, and past voters — for candidates, political parties, and political action committees legally entitled to access them under state law. For example, a statewide list that currently costs $6,000 will soon be available for $600.
“The cost reduction is intended to make the information more accessible to those qualified to purchase such lists under the Code of Virginia in an effort to promote transparency,” the agency said in a news release.
The new policy comes as political interest ramps up ahead of the November general election, which includes statewide races for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and for all 100 General Assembly seats. 
Access to detailed voter files can be critical for campaign outreach, data modeling, and voter engagement efforts — especially for first-time or underfunded candidates who have long found the pricing prohibitive.
Under Virginia law, voter data can be purchased only by specific entities: candidates running for office, political parties and committees, political action committees, nonprofit groups conducting voter outreach, and academic institutions doing election research. The state does not sell this information to the general public or commercial interests.
The voter files themselves include essential information such as voter names, gender, addresses, voting districts, and a record of whether a person voted in previous elections. While the files offer valuable insight for campaigns and researchers, they do not include sensitive personal details such as Social Security numbers, exact birth dates, or phone numbers.
“Prices are calculated based on the amount of information requested,” the Department of Elections noted. “Once the price is calculated using current methods, the cost to the purchaser will be reduced by 90 percent.”
The change was posted to the department’s Client Services page and comes after years of criticism over Virginia’s relatively high fees for voter data. 
As of early 2025, the state charged $5,000 for its full voter file, placing it among the most expensive in the country. According to a Ballotpedia analysis, Virginia was one of just a few states where the cost exceeded $1,000 — far above the 24 states that charge less and the 10 states and the District of Columbia that provide the data for free.
The high cost of access has long stood in contrast to Virginia’s otherwise modern and relatively accessible election systems. The state offers online registration, early voting without an excuse, and absentee voting by mail. It also allows same-day voter registration and requires either a valid form of ID or a signed statement confirming identity at the polls. 
These measures have earned Virginia high marks in national studies evaluating voting access. A 2020 study ranked it the 12th easiest state in the country in which to cast a ballot.
The updated pricing model takes effect July 1. More information, including eligibility guidelines and request forms, is available on the Virginia Department of Elections website.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 16:33:30+00:00,CT Mirror,Voter suppression in the name of a pre-existing law,Emily Charest,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/24/voter-suppression-in-the-name-of-a-pre-existing-law/,"Laws restricting non-citizens from voting already exist, posing the question of what  the goal of the SAVE Act truly is?","This past November, I had the opportunity to engage in my first presidential election. Being out of state for school, I requested an absentee ballot. Like most new voters, I was quickly overwhelmed with navigating my state’s official website. Once I received, completed, and mailed my ballot back, I obsessively checked the status so that I could find a solution in the case that it was rejected. 
Many young voters struggle with similar woes, from simply filling the ballot out, to meeting deadlines, and even struggles with postage. These factors have led to a disproportionate number of young voters’ mail-in ballots being rejected. These concerns become even more pressing when considering intentional laws and policies that prevent certain groups from voting with ease.    


Voter suppression has long been utilized to bolster party movements. Barriers through laws, and challenges surrounding voting accessibility for certain groups are utilized to discourage people from voting. Today, voter suppression often takes the form of purging voter rolls aimed at removing ineligible voters, for instance, someone who has moved, but it can also result in the removal of eligible voters. Other ways voter suppression has occurred is through a lack of adequate polling places, especially in low-income areas, and restrictive laws surrounding voter identification at the polls.  
According to the ACLU, voter suppression forms often disproportionately impact BIPOC communities, low income citizens, students and naturalized U.S. citizens. 
Recently, a bill referred to as The “SAVE Act” was passed in the House. This bill calls for ‘documentary proof of United States citizenship,’ actively amending the  National Voter Registration Act of 1993. This bill is problematic in relation to voter accessibility. Voting rights groups say it “[…] will pose a barrier for millions of American women and others who have changed their legal name because of marriage, assimilation or to better align with their gender identity […and could] disenfranchise others from marginalized communities who are less likely to have the necessary documentation readily available”. 

Emily Charest
In particular, for students whose name does not match their birth certificate, a common reality for many college students, voting becomes a lot harder as identity is questioned. Laws restricting non-citizens from voting already exist, posing the question of what  the goal of the SAVE Act truly is? The bill prompts people to believe the false narrative that non-citizens are voting. 
As a first time voter, who has not voted enough times to have personal experience of the polls, these false narratives can be dangerous. For instance, I rely strongly on research and media to provide evidence that the electoral system is accurate. If I were to solely utilize media sources conveying false narratives, my outlook on the polls would be much different. In connection with voter suppression, rhetoric that misleadingly creates distrust around democratic processes “[…] fuel some state legislatures’ efforts to pass restrictive voting laws that aim to make voting harder for targeted communities”. 
This bill directly impacts groups who have been targeted by voter suppression laws. The Save Act aims to create barriers in order to mute the civic engagement of some, strengthening the voice of a handpicked demographic. If passed into Law, this bill would set a precedent for similar legislation that mutes voices in the future. 
Literacy tests, known for preventing African Americans from registering to vote which  ended around 1965, originated in Connecticut as a tactic in preventing Irish immigrants from voting. Since then, in Connecticut, progress has been made towards eradicating laws that fortify voter suppression. One fairly recent example occurred in 2020 when Connecticut changed a law that restricted people from voting absentee unless they were sick, had a disability, or couldn’t make it to the polls due to religious factors. 
This, however, is just the beginning of work that needs to be done in order to fight for and preserve the voting rights of minority groups in both state and federal elections. This momentum can’t stop here. Civic engagement is critical in pushing back against modern day voter suppression. Marginalized groups and new voters are as entitled to a voice through voting as anyone else. 
I encourage voters to look critically at voter laws, and to review the Connecticut voting guidelines in preparation for the next elections. Voter education, like the voter guide linked above, is important for understanding when, where, and how to vote, and pushes back barriers to voting.

Wes Moore hands a pen used to sign the state's $67 billion fiscal 2026 budget to House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Moore administration plans to slash about $121 million from the state’s personnel budget through a combination of buy-outs to state employees, a hiring freeze and elimination of at least 150 vacant positions, officials said Tuesday.
The measures were announced in a “Dear colleagues” letter from Gov. Wes Moore (D) to state employees that was sent at noon Tuesday.
Moore Chief of Staff Fagan Harris said in an interview with Maryland Matters that state officials have been trying for weeks to come up with a plan to get the savings from the state’s general fund, in accordance with the fiscal 2026 budget that the governor signed in May.
“It’s going to be all of these things that help us get to the number, ultimately,” Harris said.
As recently as two weeks ago, the administration was looking at layoffs of current workers as part of the budget-cutting mix, according to an administration official at the time. But Harris said Tuesday that they were ultimately able to stop short of actual layoffs.
Moore’s administration is also pushing state agencies to come up with “creative” cost-cutting solutions, Harris said. That includes “in-sourcing” contracted jobs and consolidating physical facilities, to the extent possible, he said.
The administration’s plan excludes the University System of Maryland, which previously announced cuts, and the state’s “24/7” facilities, such as prisons, hospitals and juvenile facilities, as well as sworn state troopers and public safety officials, Harris said.
The “dear colleague” letter said the hiring freeze will begin July 1. Harris said it is likely to last at least through the fiscal year.
The precise terms for voluntary separation agreements is likely to be released in the coming weeks, Harris said. Harris said the administration does not yet have a goal for acceptances of the buy-out offer.
“We want to drive as much adoption as we can, but there’s no specific target,” Harris said.
The administration is planning to bring a list of vacant positions to the Board of Public Works for elimination around September.
“We want to make it so that the public does not feel these changes,” Harris said. “We certainly are aware of a large universe of savings there, but we’re going to be really careful and intentional this summer, as we work through this to achieve as many savings as we can responsibly.”

State Representative Stell Parker Selby (D-Milton) has resigned from the Delaware House of Representatives following a serious medical issue that has prevented her from participating in the 2025 legislative session.
House Speaker Melissa Minor-Brown announced Tuesday that she received Parker Selby’s letter of resignation.
Parker Selby, who was re-elected in November 2024 to represent the 20th District, has been absent from legislative proceedings this year due to her ongoing health recovery.

With only four meeting days remaining in the 2025 legislative calendar, Parker Selby’s departure leaves her seat vacant as the General Assembly wraps up its work for the year.
According to Delaware law, a special election must be held to fill the vacancy.
Minor-Brown said she will issue a writ of election within 10 days, setting the special election date between 30 and 35 days after the writ is issued.
Parker Selby, a retired educator and long-time community advocate, was first elected in 2022.
“I know I’m not alone in saying that I have deep respect for Stell Parker Selby, not just as a legislator, but as a person,” Minor-Brown said in a statement. “She has spent the past five decades actively serving her community and I know firsthand that this was not an easy decision for her and her family to come to.”
Stell came up through the segregated school system of Sussex County and went on to become a beloved educator, respected administrator, councilwoman, vice mayor, and ultimately, the first Black person ever elected from Sussex County to the Delaware General Assembly, Minor-Brown pointed out.
“There aren’t many people around who have lived in the Lewes and Milton community without Stell’s presence,” she said. “Her deep, personal connection to her home was cultivated through her lifelong commitment to helping those around her. That’s what made her such an effective advocate and trusted voice for the people of the 20th District. She’s touched so many lives over the years, and I know the thousands of people she’s served in her time feel as proud of her as we do.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-24-at-12.23.14-PM.png,,,2025-06-24 13:11:24.790161

Mark Gordon and Northern Mariana Islands Gov. Arnold Palacios listen. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham joined leaders from other western states and U.S. territories Monday in publishing a report that proposes government solutions to make housing more affordable across the region.
A group of bipartisan governors joined Lujan Grisham for the opening news conference of the annual Western Governors’ Association in Santa Fe.
As the organization’s chair, Lujan Grisham has for the past year led its push to expand lower-cost options for places to live.
The report offers fixes for what it says are zoning and land use laws that impede housing development, slow and complicated permitting systems, not enough financing tools for affordable housing, high home prices and too few construction workers.
US Interior Secretary Burgum hypes innovation at WGA, steers clear of public lands controversy

During the news conference, Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, called the report a roadmap for how western state governments can catch up on building workforce and affordable housing, including using public lands.
She pointed to state-owned land at the state fairgrounds in Albuquerque, where New Mexico is “moments away” from announcing the results of a competitive bidding process for hiring a master planner who will oversee multi-use development there.
“We are looking at moving the fair and redeveloping a brand new revitalized housing and community neighborhood initiative there,” Lujan Grisham said. In April, she signed legislation giving state officials authority to issue hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds and take other steps to develop the land.
Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican and the association’s immediate past chair, said issues like housing, water and fire resource management have come to the fore with many people moving to the West.
When the states and the federal government come together, Gordon said, “there really are no problems that we can’t successfully address.”
South Dakota’s Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden said he’s impressed with the reception governors have received from the second Trump administration, however, he believes the country’s problems will not be solved in Washington but rather by state governments.
“I’ve been encouraged that we’ve got cabinet secretaries in place, a number of them that are very willing to work with the governors to find solutions,” Rhoden said.
Several Trump-appointed leaders are scheduled to speak to Western Governors’ Association this week.
When asked about the proposal in Congress for some public lands to at least be nominated to be sold and used for housing, Lujan Grisham said the notion that we don’t need any public lands is likely to be a “non-starter” in New Mexico.
“The process that has been described so far is a problem for a state like New Mexico wherein our public lands, we have a very strong relationship with the openness and they belong to all of us,” Lujan Grisham said. “And selling that to the private sector without a process, without putting New Mexicans first, is, at least for me as a governor, going to be problematic.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he hopes the federal government includes states in a search for federal land that could be used for housing or other uses.
“Coloradans really treasure our access, and it would be a devastating blow to the quality of life, as well as to our economy, if areas were fenced off and the public was denied access,” said Polis, a Democrat.
One of the recommendations in the WGA’s housing report is for Congress to consider legislation to allow agencies beyond the U.S. Forest Service to lease some federal lands for affordable housing used by federal workers and local communities.
“With the concentration of federal lands in the West, leveraging certain parcels for responsible housing development is an additional strategy to address affordable housing shortages,” the report states.

In January, New Mexico environment officials cited the base for a spill of wastewater containing firefighting foam with PFAS which soaked into the aquifer after a retaining pond leaked. (U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Alexx Mercer)The New Mexico environment and Department of Justice on Monday announced a new lawsuit against the U.S. Department of the Air Force seeking redress for PFAS contamination at Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis.
Specifically, as delineated in a news release, the suit aims to order the Air Force to:

end all use of PFAS-containing firefighting foam at Cannon for anything other than emergency purposes
provide water treatment systems to residents whose water has been affected by PFAS contamination
install drinking water lines for any willing residents currently serviced by private wells in the spill area
hold regular public meetings with the community
install stormwater controls and retention basins to prevent offsite migration of PFAS from contaminated media
evaluate nearby private property affected by PFAS contamination
compensate the owners of such property for losses resulting from PFAS contamination





What are PFAS?
Per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances – aka PFAS – are a class of thousands of manmade chemicals used in waterproofing. They are in everyday items such as cookware or takeout containers and also in fire-fighting foams for aircraft. But the chemicals’ resistance to breaking down from exposure to water, heat and sunlight mean that they are accumulating in the soil and water and in the bodies of animals and people.
Health officials have linked PFAS to health risks such as decreased fertility, immune system damage, lower vaccine effectiveness and increased cancer risks.




In January, New Mexico environment officials issued a nearly $68,000-dollar fine to the Cannon U.S. Air Force Base Tuesday, stating the military had failed to immediately report a 4,000-gallon spill of PFAS into the groundwater in August. Cannon appealed the fine in February.
The new lawsuit follows the enactment of House Bill 140 following the most recent legislative session, which expanded the state’s authority to require cleanup of PFAS. Specifically, New Mexico has argued PFAS was subject to regulation under the Hazardous Waste Act since 2019, but the Air Force disagreed and sued NMED over the issue. HB 140 explicitly designates discarded firefighting foams containing PFAS chemicals as hazardous waste.
“After years of contesting responsibility, today’s lawsuit puts every one of the Air Force’s excuses to rest,”Environment Department Secretary James Kenney said in a statement regarding the new lawsuit. “The Air Force has spent years contesting the Environment Department’s authority as opposed to any meaningful cleanup of the toxic PFAS contamination in local drinking water sources that serve both residents and dairy farmers.”
Battle between New Mexico and US Air Force to track toxic chemicals drags on

In 2018, outflows from Cannon AFB contaminated water sources with PFAS in 2018 and caused dairy farmers to euthanize thousands of cows.
“PFAS contamination poses a serious and long-term threat to our environment and our communities,” Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “We are committed to using every legal tool available to hold the federal government accountable for the damage done on the base and the surrounding community and to prevent further harm from these dangerous ‘forever chemicals.’ New Mexicans deserve clean water, safe soil, and a future free from toxic exposure—and we won’t stop fighting until they get it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pfasphoto.jpg,,,2025-06-24 12:13:09.079194

The WGA continues through Tuesday at the Eldorado Hotel with more speakers from the Trump administration. (Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum acknowledged the importance of public land in the west during remarks to the Western Governors’ Association on Monday, but did not address the prospect of 250 million acres of Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service land becoming eligible for sale under the proposed federal budget making its way through Congress.
Nor did any of the western governors ask him about the Congressional Republican proposal when Burgum took their questions. The secretary did not take questions from the media and, as of publication, press availability with him had not been announced.
Originally scheduled to speak later in the day, Burgum instead swapped places with Education Secretary Linda McMahon. A protest against the sale of public lands timed to Burgum’s original speaking time proceeded as planned.
Public lands protesters picket Western governors’ conference

Former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a Democratic candidate in New Mexico’s 2026 governor’s race, released a statement Monday denouncing the GOP proposal and said Burgum “should answer to New Mexicans while he visits our state and explain why he prioritizes corporate greed over New Mexico’s wellbeing.”
In his remarks, Burgum, a former governor of North Dakota, noted his belief that “the only people that should ever be head of Interior are people who’ve already been a western governor,” and noted that states such as New Mexico, Montana and Wyoming—to name a few—“are more than geographic destinations.” They aren’t “snow globes,” he said. “One of my messages here to all of you today is one of abundance…you can have amazing national parks, national historic sites, national monuments, you can work collaboratively with the tribes…and you can still contribute mightily to the nation’s economy and the nation’s security.”
Burgum returned to the theme of “abundance” in remarks about energy and what he characterized as the United States’ over-dependence on China for “critical minerals.” That “lopsided” dependence, he said, works against environmental concerns, contending that “if you care about the environment, do it in the U.S., because we do this stuff cleaner, smarter and safer than anyone. So, energy dominance is about us…having affordable energy to power all Americans.” Having “low-cost, affordable reliable energy,” he continued “drives everything home…because it keeps inflation down for every single production. There isn’t a product you wear, there isn’t a product that you eat, there isn’t a product that you drive, there isn’t a home that you live in that doesn’t have an energy component already in it.”

President Donald Trump upon taking office issued an executive order prioritizing mineral mining on federal lands and opening the door to rescinding existing bans.
While WGA emphasizes the bipartisan nature of its organization, Burgum alluded to outside tensions, arguing that “part of the divisiveness in our country is getting people to believe that everything is scarce, and if we do A, then we can’t do B, or if we do B, we can’t do A. We just have to get an abundance mindset, and we have to understand that innovation will solve any problem that we have.”
Specifically, he homed in on artificial intelligence, which he said is “going to change every job, every company and every industry. It would be impossible for me to overhype this in any possible way.”
Technological advances “extends human capability” such that “we’re at this tipping point where we now have the ability to actually solve all of our problems and stop living in a world where everything is a trade-off.”
But this vision can only come to pass if America has enough energy, Burgum said, and at present “our grid is at great risk.” Rolling blackouts and rolling brownouts during peak summer and peak winter are possible, he said, not because of climate change or the environment, but because you “can’t run a grid if the majority of your energy source is intermittent.” For instance: “The sun goes down at night,” thus, “there’s no solar production at night in this country.”
On the other hand, he said, in about 10 years, “the advancements coming in nuclear will produce clean energy in unlimited forms.” Burgum noted four executive orders Trump signed in May aimed at expediting approval of nuclear reactors, among other goals.
Hence, he said “the existential threat that we are facing is not one or two degrees of climate change in 2100, because we’ll solve all that… in the next decade or two by the innovation that will be provided if we can cut the red tape and have enough energy to drive AI and have enough energy to sell to our friends and allies, so they can stop buying from our adversaries.”
Outgoing WGA Chair New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham recently announced a $1 billion geothermal plant in the state and attended an energy summit in Alaska. In her question to Burgum about the role western states can play, she noted that New Mexico “continues to have huge opportunities for energy production, everything from fossil fuels to small-scale nuclear.” Western governors want to “help demonstrate” the ability to deploy “effective clean energy across the spectrum.”
Burgum noted that the strategy in New Mexico and other Western states is one of “energy abundance” and an “understanding it’s not an energy transition.”
New Mexico does, in fact, have an Energy Transition Act that sets zero-carbon goals for the coming decades.
“There is no transition,” Burgum continued. “It’s energy addition. We need everything we have, and then we need a lot more of it.”

After Helene washed out the two main transmission lines from North Fork and a backup bypass line, the city focused on restoring service as quickly as possible. (Photo provided by City of Asheville’s Water Resources Department)The North Carolina Senate Agriculture, Energy, and Environment Committee approved a revised version of a House proposal on Tuesday that would halt significant new transfers of surface water, an issue brought forth by Hurricane Helene.
House Bill 850, or “Interbasin Transfer Moratorium/Study,” would place a moratorium on the issuance of certificates for some surface water transfers while the North Carolina Collaboratory studies the issue. The bill passed the House in May by a vote of 108-1.
Primary sponsor Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) said that in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, he spent a lot of time at the Hickory Regional Airport. Flying along on some rescue missions, he was able to observe the displacement of water around Lake James and the Linville Gorge.
Adams described how floods had scoured both sides of the gorge, pushing the trees and earth into Lake James.
“Lake James had kind of a caramel look to it, whereas it’s normally one of the most pristine lakes in the Catawba River system, so that was very alarming for me to see,” he said.
He began to wonder how much of the capacity of Lake James had been reduced.
In the Catawba River system, reservoirs like Lake James and Lake Norman store water for human use.
“The capacity, in my mind, has unquestionably been reduced, and that’s a very important characteristic of the system for all of us,” Adams said. “That’s the basis for the moratorium: simply asking for more time.”
Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) said she’s originally from Atlanta and is familiar with the debates over water between Georgia and Florida.
She asked how the city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County feel about the issue.
“I think they recognize that it’s in their best interest that the system itself altogether be healthy,” Adams said. “They need to know as well what the status is.”
The Senate committee substitute approved Tuesday sets a clear date for the moratorium to end on March 21, 2027. The original bill had simply set a date of six months after the submission of the Collaboratory’s study results.
No members of the general public provided testimony on the bill.
The legislation proceeds to the Senate Rules Committee. If approved by the Senate, it will be returned to the House for concurrence with the Senate changes.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/North-Fork-Reservoir-1024x768.webp,,,2025-06-24 12:13:09.079194

(Stock photo by Paul Souders/Getty Images)Do you remember the shocking images from the Exxon Valdez or Deepwater Horizon oil spills? The oil-slicked birds, the wrecked beaches, the empty fishing boats, and worst of all, the stories of lost lives? The Trump administration wants to bring polluting and dangerous oil and gas offshore drilling back — including to our New England shores. Here at the Conservation Law Foundation, we’re joining a lawsuit to stop this reckless plan.
In the chaos of the first months of the new regime, you’d be forgiven for overlooking this news story, but we can’t let it go unnoticed. In one of the most outrageous moves coming out of the Trump administration, the president has issued a series of executive orders pushing to open our iconic coastal waters to oil and gas drilling.
They want to exploit the waters of the Outer Continental Shelf, which make up much of the ocean surrounding the U.S. They want to loosen rules designed to protect the marine environment and the coasts. They even want to review national marine sanctuaries and monuments, the national parks of the sea, to see if we can plant some oil derricks on them as well. That means oil rigs in our lobster grounds. Pipelines cutting through fragile marine sanctuaries. The constant threat of spills on our coasts.
If you’re wondering, “Hey, didn’t Biden ban drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf?” Yes, he did, and no, President Donald Trump’s attempt to reverse the ban isn’t legal. That’s what the lawsuit is about. 
Trump claims the U.S. is in an “energy emergency.” Spoiler alert: We’re not. In fact, we’re producing more fossil fuels than ever before. This isn’t about energy security. It’s about handing over our ocean to polluters. This flimsy justification won’t hold up in court, which is why we’ve joined Earthjustice and many other environmental organizations to challenge it.
In the last year alone, climate change has fueled a hurricane that swamped North Carolina, wildfires that leveled whole neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and floods that wiped out Vermont communities. As the environmental, financial, and human costs soar before our eyes, we need to be ramping down our fossil fuel production, not ripping up the seafloor in search of more.
Fossil fuels pose an enormous danger to our climate, but they also pose a more immediate danger to everyone who has to interact with them. One study found that between 1968 and 2011, fossil fuel accidents claimed the lives of almost 5,000 Americans.
Let’s not forget that offshore drilling is a messy, high-risk business. The previously mentioned Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon catastrophes have dominated the news, but in 2003 an oil barge hit rocks off our own Cape Cod coast and dumped 98,000 gallons of oil into the waters of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The oil fouled beaches and marshes and, according to NOAA, killed countless birds while destroying oyster, clam, and fish habitat.
Our ocean is too precious to New England’s way of life to risk with dangerous, unnecessary oil drilling. Offshore drilling destroys seafloor habitats, pollutes our waters, and risks destructive oil spills. A New England ocean littered with oil rigs could mean an end to summer holidays on the beach, our iconic lobster industry, thriving fish populations, and more.
That’s why the Conservation Law Foundation is stepping up to stop the Trump administration’s reckless plan to bring offshore drilling to our shores. We’ve fought attempts to drill in our waters for decades, and we’re not stopping now. 
The Trump administration’s offshore drilling plan is an insult to every New Englander who values our ocean, our way of life, and our future. We will not let anyone turn our coast into another oil-soaked headline.

The Southern Delaware Orchestra (SODELO) is tuning up for a vibrant summer, headlined by a series of concerts titled “A Summer Celebration of America’s Music.”
The performances, taking place in July and August, spotlight some of the nation’s most iconic composers and reflect the orchestra’s ongoing mission to foster a love of orchestral music across Southern Delaware.
The summer series kicks off with two performances: July 19 at Milford High School and July 20 at Cape Henlopen High School, both beginning at 3 p.m.
These concerts will mark a milestone for SODELO, with the Milford performance serving as the orchestra’s debut at the first public high school in Sussex County to offer string education.
Under the baton of internationally acclaimed conductor and cellist Stephen Czarkowski, and featuring Metropolitan Opera soprano Dr. Makeda Hampton, the program will include works by American greats such as Aaron Copland, George Gershwin, John Williams, Richard Rodgers, and Irving Berlin.
“We are truly excited about a program that raises the bar high for the orchestra and features the talents of these amazing guest artists,” said SODELO Co-Founder and Board President Stephen Greifer. “We promise an evening of favorites, plus exploration and discovery, as we stroll through some of the greatest music from some of the most iconic composers this nation has ever produced.”
Tickets for the Cape Henlopen concert are priced at $25 for adults and $10 for students, with free admission for children 10 and under.
At Milford, veterans, students, faculty, and staff will be admitted free of charge as a gesture of welcome to the community.
The orchestra will also take the stage at the Freeman Arts Pavilion on August 12 at 7 p.m., performing selections from the “America’s Music” program. Tickets are $19, with free admission for children 12 and under.
Honoring young musicians
The summer performances will also serve as a send-off for three young violinists embarking on new chapters. Sigrid Evers of Milford High School, who joined SODELO as a freshman in 2022, is heading to Haverford College, while Cape Henlopen graduate Olivia Passwaters will attend Salisbury University.
Shelby Troyer, Salutatorian of Greenwood Mennonite School, plans to pursue nursing through the University of Delaware and Margaret H. Rollins School of Nursing, and will continue performing with SODELO.
“It is the nature of a community orchestra to include performers of all ages and backgrounds,” Greifer said, “and it is a special moment for us to wish Sigrid, Olivia and Shelby great success in the next steps in their lives, education and musical careers.”
Expanding outreach efforts
Beyond the concert hall, SODELO is deepening its educational outreach this summer through a new partnership with the Children’s Beach House in Lewes.
The orchestra’s musicians will offer 25 half-hour sessions to underserved youth, featuring percussion, soprano recorder, dance, singing, and hands-on introductions to orchestral instruments.
Founded in 2022, SODELO began as a 32-member string ensemble and has since grown into a full symphony of 75 volunteer musicians.
Its members include students, teachers, veterans, professionals, and retirees, united by a shared passion for music and community.

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations. (Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania. 










Roofers are right out there where you can see them. 


– Sergio Barajas, National Hispanic Construction Alliance executive director


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

He said blues music can help people through a tough time, and that’s why he keeps coming to the stage night after night.","Blues legend John Primer knew from a young age that he wanted to be a musician.
“When I was two or three years old, I would go around and play that thing,” Primer said. “I always wanted to be a guitar player.”
Primer, born in Mississippi, migrated to Chicago when he was 18-years-old in the early 1960s and quickly found work at local clubs, honing his guitar skills. He performed seven nights a week for seven years at Theresa’s Lounge in south Chicago alongside the Junior Wells Band. There, he sparked the interest of Vicksburg-born bluesman Willie Dixon, which ultimately led Primer to become band leader for the iconic Muddy Waters. 
“When I play with those big guys like that, they’re teaching me,” he said. “I’m in school then, because I’m learning what they’re doing, but I don’t try to be them.”
Now, he’s returning to Mississippi with The Real Deal Blues Band to play at the National Folk Festival held November 7-9 in downtown Jackson.
“Mississippi is my home, so I can’t forget about that,” he said. “It’s where I started.”
Through the years though, he said the music scene has changed around Chicago. He’s worked as a musician for more than six decades and said he’s seen it all. 
“When I got to Chicago in 1963, music was everywhere. Music was in every club in Chicago, now it’s changed. It’s not like it used to be,” he said. “It’s not many clubs like it used to be in the 60s, 70s and 80s. They’re all gone, vanished. They’re very few in Chicago now. A lot has changed.” 
But he said his love for the blues keeps him performing.
“I tell everybody, when I’m playing, I don’t work for money, but I like to get paid. I get up there and play. Thinking about the money? No. Think about the people and my love so people can know the blues, that’s why I play. They keep me going.”
Primer has a career spanning six decades and close to 100 albums. He’s been nominated for three Grammy awards, and has won countless Blues Blast and Blues Music awards. He’s performed all over the world, but he said he’s looking forward to coming home to Mississippi. Looking to the National Folk Festival, Primer said he’s going to play some fan favorites and throw in a couple songs from his recent album “Grown in Mississippi.” 
“I know what the people like, and so I’m going to try to play some of this and some of that for them. Whatever it takes to get the mood going,” he said. 
Blues to Primer is a way of living. He said blues music can help people through a tough time, and that’s why he keeps coming to the stage night after night. 
“Blues help you with your pain. Not physical pain, but if you had a bad night, you lost a loved one or some person passed away,” he said. “A lot of people come to me and say ‘I’ve been having a bad day, but I heard you tonight and I can go home and sleep good. I forgot about the bad feelings.’ Blues makes you forget about your troubles.”

Utah senator says Forest Service lands no longer on the block as parliamentarian finds sell-off violates reconciliation budget rules.
The post Lee cuts scope of Senate public lands sell-off plan amid setbacks, public opposition appeared first on WyoFile .","In the face of mounting bipartisan criticism, Utah Sen. Mike Lee has backed off from a plan to sell Forest Service land at the same time a congressional official concluded his proposal didn’t meet rules to fast-track the federal budget.
Lee, a Republican, had sought to include a “mandatory disposal” provision in the Senate’s reconciliation budget, a measure that would have put 2-3 million acres of public land up for sale in Wyoming and 10 other Western states. The provision, Lee maintained, would help reduce the deficit and supply housing in the West. The reconciliation package can be passed by a simple majority.
But in a post on X Monday evening Lee said he would no longer target U.S. Forest Service lands in the plan forwarded by his Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
His about-face came as a Senate rule-maker — Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough — opined that the 11-page mandatory disposal section didn’t comply with a rule requiring reconciliation measures — the Republican’s One Big, Beautiful Bill in this case — to focus on budget matters.
“We are NOT selling off our forests.” Mike Lee
That means the provision would be subject to protest and a ruling by the presiding senator when the matter is considered by the upper chamber. Measures that are found to violate the rule must be passed by 60 votes, not a simple majority.
In a narrowly divided Senate, that prospect would likely doom the land-sale effort.
“Here’s what I plan to do,” Lee posted. “REMOVE ALL Forest Service land. We are NOT selling off our forests.”
Further, Lee would require lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management to be considered for sale only if they were within five miles of population centers. He would also ensure the lands benefit American families, he said. Critics have worried foreign investors might swoop in on the sales.
Democrats said Monday evening that Republicans continue to violate the rule.
“Today, the Senate Parliamentarian again advised that several provisions in the Republicans’ ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill,’ would be subject to a 60-vote threshold if they remain in the bill,” Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, posted on the committee’s website.
One of the seven provisions ruled out-of-bounds required mandatory public land sales. “This section mandates the unprecedented sale of millions of acres of public land, including from both Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service lands,” Democrats said.
Lee’s provision sparked an outburst of opposition as Wyoming residents of all stripes rose up to criticize it. U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, all Republicans, told upset constituents that the Wyoming delegation continued to support President Donald Trump’s agenda.
Criticism of the measure, Hageman wrote, amounts to “an effort to control these lands to ensure our amenities are used solely by the independently wealthy, who have little concern as to whether there is affordable housing available for the people who seek to make their lives in places like Kemmerer or Green River or Pinedale.”
But Democrats have countered that it is the Republican public lands plan that would benefit the wealthy at the expense of average Americans.
“Democrats will not stand idly by while Republicans attempt to circumvent the rules of reconciliation in order to sell off public lands to fund tax breaks for billionaires,” Merkley said in a statement.“Democrats continue to show up and fight every provision of this Big, Beautiful Betrayal of a bill, because this bill is an attack on workers and families everywhere,” he stated. “We will make sure the Byrd Rule is followed and review any changes Republicans attempt to make.”

Andrea Campbell and three other blue state attorneys general took to Washington on Monday to describe their ongoing fight against Trump administration policies in court.
The post In Washington, Campbell defends states’ efforts against Trump’s executive overreach appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE FIREHOSE OF Trump administration actions has not slowed down one bit since blue state attorneys general last month touted their efforts to push back on what they see as dramatic executive overreach.  
Speaking before a group of Democratic members of Congress on Monday, the top state prosecutors from Massachusetts, Minnesota, Illinois, and New Jersey laid out their litany of lawsuits over the last six months. A coalition of about two dozen Democratic attorneys general have fought the administration, often in New England federal courts, over issues including National Institutes of Health funding for medical research, the ability of Harvard University to enroll foreign students and defend its tax status, consumer protection policy, endangered green energy options like offshore wind, and immigration policy including birthright citizenship. 
Campbell identified both birthright citizenship and the due process violations of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement as two major areas of concern. 
Both Tufts doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk and Milford High School student Marcelo Gomes da Silva were arrested off the streets by federal agents, who Campbell noted were masked and unidentified.  
“ICE and local authorities would have you or have us believe that they were doing it all to promote public safety, which is total nonsense,” Campbell said. “They were doing it to create fear in our communities and they’re continuing to do that.” 
Along with filing lawsuits, Campbell said she and other state authorities have put out guidance for people on what to expect in interactions with ICE, as well as connecting them with attorneys. While Öztürk and Gomes have been released, Campbell said, their cases indicate a troubling indifference to the due process rights enshrined in the 14th Amendment and the rights of free expression. 
The “spotlight forum” was a joint hearing brought by Democratic US representatives and senators. Without control over either chamber of Congress, the series of subject-specific special hearings is something of an attempt to highlight Democratic action at a time when the president is wielding executive power in ways that may infringe on the “power of the purse” granted to Congress by the country’s founding documents. 
Exercises of presidential authority, in any given administration, often prompt a deeply partisan response. As was the case in May, with a gathering of New England attorneys general, Campbell told lawmakers “sadly it is only Democratic AGs that are standing up in this moment in time.” 
While congressional Republicans have largely backed President Donald Trump’s actions on tariffs, budget slashing, and broadsides against diversity initiatives, some disagreement is rising around the president’s decision to involve the United States in military strikes against Iran without congressional approval. 
This leaves state attorneys general with a heavy responsibility, lawmakers said.  
Attorneys general and lawmakers noted that the Trump administration has received blistering ruling from judges appointed by both parties, including Reagan appointee US District Judge John Coughenour, who blocked the president’s order purporting to end birthright citizenship for children of parents in the country illegally.  
 “I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is,” Coughenour told a Justice Department attorney. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.” 
Another Reagan nominee, US District Judge William Young, last week ordered the National Institutes of Health to reinstate hundreds of research grants slashed centered around themes of gender and sexuality, Covid-19 and vaccines for the disease, or health disparities.  
Campbell said she is careful about “defining how we’re winning, because I never want to discount the real harm that people are suffering and experiencing.” 
A missed clinical trial can mean life or death for a patient, she said. The damage caused by funding cuts, attacks on medical and higher education institutions, and trade uncertainty ripple out into the broader Massachusetts economy, Campbell added, noting the impact on people’s ability to live and receive care. 
Massachusetts General Brigham is the largest recipient of NIH funding, Campbell said, and has had to make significant program cuts. The cuts are impacting research on antibodies, she said, and halting clinical trials. 
The lower courts have stalled some of the sweeping presidential actions, which some Republicans claim is an unacceptable use of judicial power, but the end result once the Supreme Court weighs in on Trump’s actions is far from certain.  
As the attorneys general testified, the Supreme Court issued an emergency ruling lifting an order from Boston-based US District Judge Brian Murphy requiring that migrants set for deportation to so-called “third countries” get a “meaningful opportunity” to tell federal officials they are at risk of torture at their new destination.  
Laid out before them, the four state prosecutors said, is a broad attack on the rule of law.  At stake are a functioning economy and a responsive government. 
Explaining the magnitude of the attacks is critical, Campbell said.  
“I’ve been telling folks, regardless of how you feel about the 14th amendment, pick the amendment that you like,” she said, “because they can come after that one too.”

The notice came on the three-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, and ended nearly 50 years of a constitutional right to an abortion. 
It also follows a decision earlier this month by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to rescind guidance that emphasized hospitals are responsible for providing emergency abortion care despite state bans, saying it does not reflect the Trump administration’s policy.
“Due to recent federal action taken and guidance issued, the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs reminds you that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) remains in force, including its requirement to provide screening and appropriate follow up care,” the notice stated. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office said the decision to rescind the guidance will place thousands of lives at risk by restricting women’s ability to access appropriate emergency health care. 
“Here in Michigan, we believe everyone deserves the freedom to make their own decisions about their reproductive health,” Whitmer said in a press release. “We trust women to make decisions that are right for their bodies, lives, and futures. I’ll keep fighting like hell to protect your freedoms.” 
 The notice makes clear to Michigan hospitals that the state’s authority on reproductive health issues is not preempted by decisions made by the federal government. It also says that while state-licensed health facilities and agencies aren’t required to admit patients for the purpose of performing an abortion, they “are still required to offer adequate and appropriate care for the services they provide.”
In its press release, Whitmer’s office states that by not enforcing the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, the Trump administration is “providing cover to hospitals systems that have ideological opposition to abortions, putting the life of the mother at risk in the process.”
 Meanwhile, reproductive rights advocates note that in the three years since Roe was overturned, more than 20 states have severely restricted or placed outright bans on access to abortion. Combined with a lack of clarity around the responsibilities of hospitals in those states to provide appropriate care, those advocates say the result has been a number of preventable deaths.
“Knowing this, the Trump administration still revoked Biden-era guidance around lifesaving emergency care, making their stance as clear as ever: when faced with a life or death situation, they do not care if pregnant people die,” Paula Thornton Greear, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Michigan, said.
Whitmer also expects that Trump’s decision to rescind the federal guidance will result in additional residents in states like neighboring Indiana that have abortion bans to seek reproductive health care in Michigan. That could place a strain on resources and potentially limit the services offered by Michigan hospitals, Whitmer said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8331-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 11:21:27.191450

(Photo by Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark and their golden retriever Gilbert will lie in state on Friday at the Capitol. Rep. Hortman and her husband were killed on June 14 in a “politically motivated assassination.”
Hortman will be the first woman to lie in state at the Capitol. The public may pay their respects from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. Friday, the office of Gov. Tim Walz announced Tuesday.
A private funeral will be held on Saturday, but it will be livestreamed.
Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota Legislature for two decades. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator was beloved around the Capitol and is known for scoring major legislative victories including free school lunch for K-12 students, a new paid leave program and a mandate that Minnesota utilities use 100% carbon-free energy sources by 2040.
Sophie and Colin Hortman, the children of Melissa and Mark Hortman, issued a statement calling on people to honor their parents’ legacy by doing “something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.”
“Our parents touched so many lives, and they leave behind an incredible legacy of dedication to their community that will live on in us, their friends, their colleagues and co-workers, and every single person who knew and loved them,” the Hortman children said.

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Three-time former Newport mayor and current city council member Jeanne-Marie Napolitano faces a $1,000 fine for violating state campaign finance laws over the last year.
The Rhode Island Board of Elections voted to approve a consent agreement with Napolitano at its June 17 meeting, following results of a subpoena and audit of her campaign finance account. Napolitano, a Democrat who has served nearly 30 years as a Newport city official, misreported or failed to report roughly $6,000 in combined campaign donations and spending from Jan. 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, according to the state election board’s audit. That includes more than $1,000 in cash contributions from sources who were not identified, and more than $3,200 in donations that were misreported or not reported at all.

Napolitano also used $110 from her campaign for personal use, and accepted a separate, $3,000 contribution from one donor — exceeding the $2,000-per-person per-year donation cap in state law.
Under the June 6 agreement with the elections board, Napolitano will pay a $1,000 fine, due no later than Sept. 30. She also must forfeit $2,025 from her campaign account within the next 30 days, based on failure to disclose sources of cash contributions, and exceeding the annual donation cap on a separate, individual donation.
Napolitano did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Tuesday. However, she took “full responsibility” for the violations during the board’s review, according to its audit report. Napolitano told state campaign finance staffers that she tried to handle her campaign account herself after her treasurer resigned, but it was “over her head,” the report stated.
She turned in the required information to the state elections board to complete her incorrect and incomplete campaign finance statements in May, according to the audit report.
Napolitano is a long-time fixture in city politics. She served two years on the city council from 1991 to 1995, returning again after 1999. She has won re-election in every subsequent term, and, as the top vote-getter in council elections, served three terms as city mayor, most recently from 2020 to 2022.
In 2024, Napolitano was the fourth highest vote-getter in the non-partisan race for the council’s four at-large seats, securing 14.5% of the vote.

The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) has issued a formal Notice of Violation (NOV) to the Delaware City Refining Company following an unpermitted emissions incident that occurred on March 13, 2025.
According to DNREC, the violation stems from the refinery’s release of more than 260,000 pounds of carbon monoxide and over 38,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide during a 10-hour period when its carbon monoxide boiler—a key pollution control device—was offline.
The breakdown occurred during a routine equipment maintenance operation, resulting in untreated flue gas bypassing the emissions control system.
Visible black smoke, exceeding permitted opacity levels, was also released.
The NOV cites the refinery for discharging air contaminants without a permit and failing to operate required control equipment as outlined in its air permit.
The agency said the emissions and violations were first reported to the Delaware Environmental Release Notification System (DERNS) on the day of the incident.

The March event is separate from another emissions issue currently under investigation. Between May 26 and June 12, the refinery reportedly released unpermitted sulfur dioxide emissions for 19 consecutive days.
That incident also involved a malfunction of the carbon monoxide boiler, this time caused by a water-tube leak.
Emissions violation process
An NOV is part of the multi-stage DNREC enforcement process that can include:

An initial report or notice of environmental release, which for an industrial facility can mean emissions believed to be over reportable or permitted limits
An environmental investigation, including collection of emissions data and investigation into cause of the incident
A Notice of Violation, which formally documents DNREC’s understanding of the facts, background and a description of a violation
A Notice of Administrative Penalty Assessment, proposing a monetary penalty based on the severity and duration of the violation.
A Notice of Conciliation, prescribing specific actions a facility has agreed to take to return to compliance.
A DNREC Secretary’s Order, requiring corrective measures to be completed by a set deadline.
A possible appeal by a facility of DNREC’s NOV, requirements or penalties, which by law can go to the Environmental Appeals Board and to state court.

The refinery may appeal the NOV or any future penalties through the state’s Environmental Appeals Board or in court.
More information on the violation and the ongoing investigation can be found on the Delaware Environmental Navigator, DNREC’s public database for environmental compliance records.
The Delaware City refinery has a capacity of 180,000 barrels per day and a high complexity rating of 13.6, enabling it to process a wide range of heavy, high-sulfur crude oils.
Located on a 5,000-acre site along the Delaware River, it receives crude via rail and water and distributes refined products through pipelines, barges, tankers, trucks, and rail. It is one of the largest and most complex refineries on the U.S. East Coast.

Mike Braun announced. (Getty Images)Indiana’s 15 public colleges and universities will freeze in-state undergraduate tuition and mandatory fees for the next two academic years, Gov. Mike Braun announced Monday morning.
The Republican governor called the move a “historic” step toward making higher education more affordable.
The freeze applies to all flagship and regional campuses across the state and will keep costs flat through the 2026-2027 academic year. 










The commitment made by all of Indiana’s public colleges and universities puts students and parents first and demonstrates to the rest of the country that Indiana is a leader in providing a high quality education at an affordable price.


– Indiana Gov. Mike Braun


That includes Ball State University; Indiana State University; Indiana University’s Bloomington, East, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Kokomo, Northwest, South Bend and Southeast campuses; Ivy Tech Community College; Purdue’s West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne and Northwest campuses; University of Southern Indiana; and Vincennes University.
It marks the first time since at least 2010 that more than two Hoosier campuses have simultaneously frozen tuition — and the first time ever that all state colleges and universities have done so at once, according to Braun’s office.
“A month ago, we challenged our state’s public higher education institutions to find efficiencies, eliminate redundancies and identify ways to streamline services without compromising quality,” Braun said in a statement. “The commitment made by all of Indiana’s public colleges and universities puts students and parents first and demonstrates to the rest of the country that Indiana is a leader in providing a high quality education at an affordable price.”
Schools can still raise rates for room and board, however, and some institutions will additionally raise attendance costs for international students.
Higher education costs in the spotlight
The tuition freeze came at Braun’s request, just weeks after he signed Indiana’s next two-year state budget, which takes effect July 1. 
Under state law, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (CHE) must issue tuition recommendations within 30 days of the budget’s approval. Typically, each university system sets its own tuition schedule, which is approved by CHE. 
But last month, commissioners instead announced their unanimous support for the governor’s recommendation to implement the 0% increase. It was the first such recommendation ever made by the higher education panel.



“While the Commission, along with our institutions and other partners, have leveraged policies, programs, and partnerships to keep our colleges and universities affordable, we all recognize the economic challenges our fellow Hoosiers have faced over the past several years,” said Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education Chris Lowery. “In the spirit of seeking to maintain Indiana’s national leadership in affordability, the Commission is in full support of Gov. Braun’s recommendation for a 0% tuition increase.” 
The announcement also comes amid growing national concern over the cost of college and rising student debt. While Indiana’s tuition rates are generally lower than other states, scrutiny about affordability has increased.
CHE officials reported last year that nearly 70% of Hoosier undergraduates receive some form of financial aid — but out-of-pocket expenses remain a barrier, particularly for first-generation and low-income students.

Facing a weak state revenue forecast, state agencies and universities — were hit with funding cuts of at least 5%, plus an additional 5% reduction in reversions. 
Braun defended the freeze, however, noting that state colleges and universities are well-positioned to absorb reductions.
“Out of all state entities, our higher education institutions are in the best financial position to weather these cuts, as state funding represents just one of the revenue streams — and institutions hold strong financial reserves,” Braun said in May. 
“Higher education institutions should address the reductions in the same way as other state entities: by refocusing on their core missions, finding efficiencies, eliminating redundancies, and identifying ways to streamline the delivery of higher education,” he continued. 
Braun pointed to success at Purdue University, where tuition and mandatory fees have stayed flat for 14 years while still “delivering successfully on (the institution’s) core mission.” 
New policy already taking effect
Across the state, campuses had already started putting the governor’s plan into action.
Ivy Tech Community College, Indiana’s largest postsecondary system by enrollment, approved its freeze earlier this month. The two-year college system has over 40 locations statewide.
At their June 12 meeting, Indiana University trustees confirmed a tuition freeze at the Bloomington flagship, as well as at campuses in Indianapolis, Kokomo, Richmond, Gary, South Bend and New Albany.
Commissioners preview changing higher education landscape

Purdue University additionally announced this month that it will maintain its longstanding freeze at the West Lafayette campus. Regional campuses in Fort Wayne and Northwest will also keep tuition flat.
Indiana State University, which has faced enrollment challenges in recent years, will participate in the tuition freeze while continuing efforts to grow its student base.
University of Southern Indiana (USI) and Vincennes University will both hold rates steady, too. 
USI student Samantha Fleischaker, who serves on the Indiana Commission for Higher Education, said in a statement that the decision will make college more accessible for families across the state.
“Keeping tuition flat keeps the door open for students of all backgrounds, all ZIP codes, and all walks of life,” Fleischaker said. “It’s not just a number. It’s the difference between opportunity and what feels impossible.”
Ball State University in Muncie will hold base undergraduate tuition steady, but school officials said room and board costs will increase slightly.
It’s not yet clear if other institutions will also raise ancillary charges, like for housing or program-specific fees.
Several institutions are further planning increases for non‑residents and international students. Purdue, for example, is raising international student fees by $500 per semester and implementing a 3% annual tuition increase for non‑resident and international undergraduates at its regional campuses starting this fall.

Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) addresses the upper chamber on May 7, 2025. (By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent. 
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.” 
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition. 
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.” 
A lifelong Mainer, Bennett currently serves as Oxford County’s senator, a term he plans to finish in 2026 to total 18 combined years of nonconsecutive service in the Maine House of Representatives and Senate, including formerly serving as Senate president. He’s vied for higher office before. Running as a Republican, Bennett narrowly lost a bid for Maine’s 2nd Congressional district in 1994 and a primary race for U.S. Senate in 2012.
He then went on to chair the Maine Republican Party from 2013 to 2016, casting a vote for President Donald Trump the year of his exit as the party’s elector. 
But his votes in the Legislature in recent years position him as one of the most bipartisan legislators. 
Bennett said he doesn’t think he’s changed his views much throughout his time in public office. Rather, he thinks the Republican Party, and politics more broadly, has embraced a toxicity that detracts from what he sees as the most pressing issues facing the state: declining quality education, a lack of access to health care particularly in rural areas and affordable housing. 
“A lot of the energizing elements in the Republican Party are not what I think respond to the needs of a lot of Maine people,” he said. 
Bennett offered a similar critique amid the state budget debate in March.
One of two Republicans to vote for a proposed change package that sought to address the urgent MaineCare deficit, Bennett told Maine Morning Star at the time that he was concerned about the growing demand for fidelity in politics entering Maine. 
“There’s an element in the Republican Party and the Republican caucuses that is sort of feeding off the chaos and disruptive energies of Donald Trump,” Bennett said, “and it’s really not a good thing to see.” 
That supplemental budget ultimately failed after opposition from others in his caucus who refused to back it without structural reform to the program, which is Maine’s version of Medicaid. Later in March, Bennett voted against the two-year budget, as well as the addition passed last week. However, he was a rare voice among Republicans in not objecting to the budget being something largely crafted and advanced by Democrats, the majority party.
“We think about these things in partisan terms far too much,” he said in March. “I object to this budget because it represents a dramatic failing of the Legislature to do its job.” 
Reiterating the reform he’s long pushed for, Bennett said in an interview ahead of announcing his gubernatorial bid that, if elected, he would push for the Legislature to overhaul its budget process, specifically by building in opportunities to re-evaluate baseline spending, which the budget plan passed in March continued as is. 
A record of crossing party lines 
While ultimately joining Republicans in opposing the budget plans for the next biennium, Bennett is no stranger to bucking his party. 
Recently, he joined Democrats in voting against a bill to ban transgender girls from playing girls sports or using girls bathrooms or locker rooms, as well as a slate of other proposals that sought to roll back protections for trans Mainers. 
While stating that he was initially unsure how he would vote, Bennett said in a speech on the Senate floor that he shared the proposals with his daughter, Abby, describing her as an accomplished athlete. 
“Her response was simple and struck me deeply,” Bennett said. “She said, ‘These bills make me sad.’ Her feelings gave me permission to be honest about mine too. I feel sadness that these are before us… I’m saddened by the hardening of silos and the temptation to stigmatize those who are different.”
Bennett also joined Democrats in voting for a bill to restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, specifically raising concern that municipalities would be on the hook to pay for their local police taking on federal immigration enforcement work, expanding their legal risk with no compensation.
“I, for one, am concerned about the use of Maine resources and the taking of those resources for activities that are governed by whatever party is in the White House,” he said on the Senate floor. “We need to focus on Maine.”  
Bennett has championed the Wabanaki Nations’ push for state recognition of their sovereignty, sweeping reform that current Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has opposed. He’s also taken interest in laying the groundwork for a four-day work week and eliminating daylight saving time, though such a change would be contingent on federal approval. 
Bennett has also advocated for significant campaign finance reform, which, as he put it, is “unfortunately one of the things that the Republicans and Democrats agree on in Augusta.”
This year, the Legislature rejected a bill Bennett proposed to offer Mainers transparency regarding who spends money in elections by requiring political action committees to disclose their donors over $5,000. The proposal was based on an Arizona law that has already been tested in and held up by the courts.
In 2023, Bennett also chaired the ballot question committee for a referendum Maine voters passed to ban companies from spending money on referendum campaigns if they are partially owned by a foreign government or entity. He also supported the referendum passed last year to place a $5,000 limit on super PACs, which are independent political action committees that can currently raise and spend unlimited funds. 
However, both of those reforms were blocked as legal battles play out in the courts. 
While Bennett has previously run his campaigns under the Maine Clean Elections Act, which offers full public financing of political campaigns, he said he will not be doing so for his gubernatorial bid, noting the currently inadequate funding for the program and higher qualifying contribution requirements for governor that he sees as difficult to achieve without the backing of a political party. 
A bill the Legislature passed, which Bennett supported, could also change how Mainers cast their votes in the gubernatorial race in 2026. It currently awaits the governor’s approval. 
LD 1666 would expand ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates by preference, for general and special elections for governor and state legislators. RCV is currently used for federal elections and gubernatorial and state-level primary elections in Maine. 
“I wasn’t wild about ranked-choice voting but the voters of Maine said twice that they want it,” Bennett said, referring to Mainers initially voting the system into law and later expanding it. “So, I have been supporting it and trying to make it work.” 
Though, Bennett declined to comment on how he thinks the expansion of this voting method would impact the governor’s race. 
The Republicans currently running for governor are state Sen. James Libby of Cumberland, Robert Charles of Bangor, who worked in the federal government during the George W. Bush administration, Navy veteran Steven Christopher Sheppard, also of Bangor, Kenneth Capron of Portland, David John Jones of Falmouth, Owen McCarthy of Gorham, 
Democratic contenders include Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson and the children of two of Maine’s current members of Congress, Hannah Pingree, also the former head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, and Angus King III.
There is also one other unenrolled candidate so far, Alexander Kenneth Murchison of Dover Foxcroft.

(Dylan Freedom/Getty Images)TOPEKA — A change in state law allows Kansans to buy and sell fireworks for two weeks before Independence Day, but local ordinances still restrict when they can be set off.
The Legislature expanded the previous nine-day window for fireworks sales earlier this year. Retailers can now sell fireworks from June 20 to July 7.
Mark Engholm, the state fire marshal, encouraged Kansans to be cautious about using fireworks and to check city and county rules before purchasing or discharging fireworks.
“Also, as Kansans prepare to celebrate Independence Day, I want to emphasize the importance of using fireworks safely and responsibly,” Engholm said.
Lawmakers for years have entertained proposals to allow year-round fireworks sales. This year, they expanded the window as part of a package of legislation bundled into Senate Bill 199 at the end of the session.
The House passed the bill by a 68-53 vote, followed by a 28-12 vote in the Senate. Gov. Laura Kelly signed the bill into law on April 8.
The owner of Jakes Fireworks and the principal of a Catholic school in Wichita, where fireworks sales are an annual fundraiser, testified in support of expanding the window for legal sales, which previously was June 27 to July 5. The legislation also allows for “permanent retailers” to operate from “permanent structures,” as opposed to seasonal retailers with pop-up tents.
Engholm testified the bill would result in more injuries and losses to fire each year. A private citizen testified against the bill because fireworks can be a trigger for those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
Other provisions in the bill designate a memorial near the Kansas Firefighters Museum in Wichita as the Fallen Firefighters Memorial of Kansas and establish a Kansas Firefighters Memorial Council.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1257438377-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 11:21:27.191450

PEORIA — For 60 years, SkillsUSA Illinois has held workforce development competitions for young people entering the trades. For 60 years, there has never been an all-female team competing in the architecture and construction team competition.

Until now, that is.

This April, students competed at the Peoria Civic Center in a bid to showcase their trades work skills, from barbering and cosmetics to house building and fixing cars. First-place winners in the Illinois competition earned eligibility to travel to Atlanta to compete in the national SkillsUSA Championships this week.

Amid the fanfare and cheer, however, the state competition highlighted some of the persistent challenges facing the Illinois workforce. As employers continue searching for skilled tradespeople to combat national worker shortages, entry into fields like construction remains strikingly low for women and people of color, particularly in higher paying and leadership positions.

SkillsUSA Illinois’ first all-girls team — Aubrey Levin, Kayhl Miles, Catelin Wesley and team captain Amyla Walls — did not know they were breaking boundaries until after they had finished their competition this spring in Peoria.

The team from the Bloomington Area Career Center reacted to the news with shocked laughter, followed by near immediate dread as they anticipated the heightened expectations and scrutiny of their work this title would bring.

“They’re going to be like, ‘You’re the first all-female team,’ and I’m going to be like, ‘Please don’t look at my electrical,’” Levin said, half laughing.

Although it may seem late for the existence of the first all-female team, it is consistent with the construction industry demographic trends in Illinois. Over the past 10 years, women have held fewer than one in 10 construction jobs. Prior to 2021, fewer than 5% of new construction apprentices in Illinois were women, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor.

The problem is a national one. Although 2020 saw the largest number of women working in trades, only one in 20 U.S. construction workers was a woman, according to a report from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.

Male construction workers were also better compensated than female construction workers in 2024, even for entry-level apprenticeship positions. New male apprentices earned an average wage of $23.76 per hour, 36 cents more than the average pay for their female counterparts.

The discrepancy grew for those who completed their apprenticeships, with an average hourly gender pay gap of $1.41.

Participation rates for workers of color also remained low, with white apprentices accounting for over three quarters of new registered apprenticeships in 2024.

Apprentices of color earn less on average than white apprentices, both at entry and completion. In 2024, newly registered Black apprentices earned on average 36 cents less in hourly wages than their white counterparts. For those who completed apprenticeships, the gap grew to almost $4 per hour.

As limited as the progress is, much of it has come in the last few years, according to Jayne Vellinga, executive director of the non-profit Chicago Women in Trades.

Vellinga attributes the momentum to “a perfect storm” of an expected construction boom and worker shortage, infrastructure investment and federal leadership on diversity initiatives.

“It did get people to think sort of outside the box in terms of how they were going to recruit a sufficient workforce to meet a large number of projects projected to come to the area and the retirement of experienced workers,” Vellinga said.

Since 2021, the state has invested heavily in the Illinois Works pre-apprenticeship program, which seeks to create a “qualified talent pipeline of diverse candidates in the construction and building trades.” Gov. JB Pritzker’s office announced an additional $19 million funding allocation to the program in April.

However, Vellinga said she is seeing a rollback in progress, pointing to President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind an executive order that  had been in place since enacted by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, which prohibited federal contractors from engaging in employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.

“I don’t know how it’s going to impact opportunities for women, but there is definitely a change in narrative also at the federal level, from ‘we need diversity on publicly funded projects’ to ‘don’t engage in diversity, equity and inclusion activities,’” Vellinga said.

In addition to outright hiring discrimination, Vellinga said many women’s careers are limited by gender stereotypes and harassment on job sites.

“Some women are doing well and are having an opportunity to move up, and other women do face discrimination, are unable to cobble together enough work during the year to make it a viable career, or perhaps the works site is so hostile that they walk away from it,” Vellinga said.

The hostility is something that the team of high schoolers was already familiar with.

As SkillsUSA Illinois’ first all-girls team spent two days using their carpentry, roofing, electrical and plumbing skills to build a small house, they were subjected to disparaging, gender-based comments, which the team diplomatically referred to as “construction language.”

It is not something unique to this competition, they said. Levin recalled asking women in the construction unions about their advice on entering tradework. They told her she would need to have thick skin.

“Even now?” Levin asked. Especially now, they replied.

The team described their male peers making jokes with double meanings, and then getting irritated if the girls did not laugh.

“You’re like a bad person for not laughing at a really bad joke,” Miles said.

One such joke came at Levin’s expense, while she was standing on a ladder and trying not to cry from pain after being hit in the back by something on site. A team nearby pointed and laughed at her, she said. A teacher walked by and told Levin to let it out if she needed to.

“Not here,” Levin said. “You can’t cry, because then you’re soft.”

On the other hand, if they got mad, Levin said, a male peer would inevitably ask, “What, are you on your period or something?”

The girls said they are held to a higher standard, as any sign of emotion will be used to prove that they are incapable of matching their male peers. If they stop for a second, they will be called lazy or asked whether they broke a nail, the team said. The job requires a strong poker face, Miles added.

And, Walls said, their judgment is constantly called into question. She recounted a male peer repeatedly correcting her and speaking to her like a child, before eventually concluding she was correct all along.

A national survey of women exiting the trades found that the most common reason women left the trades was due to harassment and lack of respect; nearly half of those who left or had strong intentions to leave marked this as their reason for doing so. Over a quarter of women in the study also indicated that they frequently or always saw sexually explicit and racist graffiti; a fifth responded the same for anti-semitic graffiti.

The second most common reason for exiting, selected by over 40% of those with strong intentions to leave, was a lack of prospects for promotion and advancement. The least selected option was that the work was too physically demanding.

The perception that women are less competent exacerbates other structural barriers to employment, according to Manny Rodriguez, executive director of the Chicago-based nonprofit Revolution Workshop, which offers workforce development programs targeted at communities of color who have been underrepresented in the trades.

Construction is a tough business for anyone, Rodriguez said. A recent paper by the RAND Corporation found that almost 40% of apprentices drop out of their programs before completion, regardless of race or gender, with almost half of those dropping out in the first six months.

Part of the issue is stability of work, such as making it through the cold season when opportunities for new construction projects dip, according to Rodriguez.

“In the wintertime, you can’t pour concrete. You can’t weld. If the structure is not already up, you pretty much got to wait until spring,” Rodriguez said.

Employer biases mean that women and people of color may be hired for jobs, but not retained for the next one, resulting in more instability for those workers, Rodriguez said. As a result, apprenticeship completion rates for women and people of color are even lower.

In 2023, women accounted for 4.5% of U.S. construction apprentices, but 6% of cancellations, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. A study by The Institute for Construction Employment Research found that over the last two decades, around two-thirds of Black construction apprentices did not complete their programs.

Hispanic workers have maintained a high share of workforce participation in the construction industry, but often in lower paying, physically intensive roles, resulting in higher rates of both fatal and nonfatal injuries on the job.

“Latinos are represented in construction, but where?” Rodriquez asked. “I’m not the electrician, I’m not the plumber, I’m not the heavy equipment operator, I’m not the pipe fitter. So you got no problem breaking my brown body, but you’re not letting me do the other things.”

Many women and people of color who do make it in construction attribute their success, at least in part, to having others who look like them in the field.

In the survey of tradeswomen, almost two thirds of respondents identified mentorship from senior tradeswomen as important to their recruitment and advancement. It was something the all-girls team said was valuable as well.

“If we passed a construction site, and they were working, I always got excited when I saw a girl,” said Miles. “I was happy about it, because I’m like, I’m not the only one who actually enjoys this.” Other members of the team agreed.

But Walls, the only Black member of the team, sees fewer women in construction who look like her.

“I don’t see a lot of women, let alone,Black women, doing construction,” Walls said. “I wish I had someone to relate to.”

That is part of the reason why breaking this barrier was important, for the girls on the team and for those who will come after them.

“It doesn’t matter if we win,” Wesley said. “The fact that we have taken a step like this for us, but also for other females in the trades, it’s a huge deal.”

Vendors at Broadacres Marketplace, a decades-old swap meet in North Las Vegas that caters largely to the Latino community, were told to close their shops at 9 a.m. Saturday and that the market would remain closed until further notice.
The market said the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution and concern” for its vendors, customers, and staff.
“We don’t want any of our customers, vendors, or employees to be detained at our business or for us to be a beacon of shopping and entertainment while our federal government is raiding businesses and detaining its people,” the Broadacres Marketplace Management team wrote on social media.
The move comes after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted a major raid at the Santa Fe Springs Swap Meet in California on June 14. The Los Angeles Times reported that dozens of agents in tactical gear with guns searched the site and detained several people as multiple helicopters circled overhead.
Following the immigration raid in Santa Fe Springs, Broadacres assured shoppers that the retail space does not cooperate with ICE or similar federal agencies, but warned that federal agents could legally enter the market “without prior notice, permission, or a warrant.”
“While we cannot control the actions of outside agencies we remain fully committed to creating a space where all people feel welcome, respected, and protected,” the Broadacres Marketplace Management team wrote on social media.
But the Santa Fe Springs raid and ongoing immigration enforcement in Las Vegas appeared to have a chilling effect. 
On Friday, the day before Broadacres officially shuttered, vendors and customers noted on social media the typically bustling open-air market was nearly empty. Only a fraction of the usual customers could be seen shopping Friday despite a discounted $1 entry fee. (Broadacres normally charges a $3 entry fee Friday nights.)
The closure leaves hundreds of vendors and employees with a significant loss of income, and no set date for a return.
“Targeting community spaces like Broadacres doesn’t make anyone safer; it only disrupts and threatens the lives of hardworking immigrant families and businesses,” said Marina Hernandez, a Broadacres vendor who runs a portrait studio, in a statement.
For nearly 50 years Broadacres has been a major economic and cultural hub for North Las Vegas. Open Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, vendors sell everything from piñatas and street food to construction gear and washing machines.
Broadacres Marketplace is the largest open-air market in Nevada, attracting more than 15,000 people every weekend. It’s one of the largest employers in the City of North Las Vegas, according to data from the Nevada Department of Employment, Training & Rehabilitation.
City of North Las Vegas Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown on Monday issued a statement saying she was “saddened” by the closure, adding that the market is “a cornerstone of our local economy and culture.”
Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto on social media criticized President Donald Trump for “indiscriminately targeting immigrant communities.” 
“These are innocent Nevadans working hard to build a better life,” read the post. “This president’s campaign of intimidation is cruel and un-American.”
Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the ACLU of Nevada and a civil rights attorney, said one of his former clients who runs a shop at Broadacres called him Saturday after she was told the market would close indefinitely.
“She’s concerned about the economic impact of Broadacres shutting down. That’s how she supports herself and her family,” Haseebullah said. 
About a decade ago, Haseebullah’s own family ran a booth at Broadacres, where they promoted their independent pharmacy during a moment of economic uncertainty. The economic stability of hundreds of employees and vendors at Broadacres is now at risk as large-scale immigration sweeps create a chilling effect in immigrant communities, said Haseebullah.
“It’s not surprising at all to me that people are fearful,” Haseebullah said. “The fear that we’re seeing in Nevada right now is well founded, because people do not feel a sense of support from the federal government, and they don’t feel a sense of support from our governor.”
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo did not respond to a request for comment on the closure of one of the largest private employers in North Las Vegas.
As immigration enforcement operations continue in Las Vegas, the Nevada Immigrant Coalition urged immigrants “to know their rights, develop family preparedness plans, and be aware of ICE officers in plainclothes and unmarked vehicles.”
 
Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has directed ICE in recent weeks to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. That has included an order to the agency to meet an arrest quota of at least 3,000 people per day.
Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people taken into ICE custody despite having no criminal record has risen sharply since January, according to the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.
Reports of U.S. citizens getting  detained for ICE have also made the headlines in several states, including Nebraska, Florida, and Arizona.
In Nevada, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department renewed its 287(g) partnership with ICE earlier this month, which deputizes police to carry out immigration duties.
“People are legitimately afraid to leave their homes, and that is evident by Broadacres closing,” said Democratic Assemblymember Cecelia González, who chairs the Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus. “The Trump administration’s enforcement tactics are not just targeting our communities. They are actively, in real time, destabilizing entire communities.”
González said the Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus tried to provide immigrant communities some sense of security through a number of bills during the legislative session, including Assembly Bill 217 which would have limited the access of immigration officials to school grounds and records without a court order or warrant. Lombardo vetoed the bill.
“We as a caucus tried to be proactive by responding to the community’s real-time fears. That is our job as elected officials, to bring forth the issues and concerns of our constituencies,” González said. 
In his veto message, Lombardo said the bill was “well-intentioned but fundamentally overbroad” and risked turning “school grounds into sanctuary zones at all times.”
“We met with his office multiple times, and he never once brought this concern up or made any suggestions,” González said. “The lack of empathy. It’s more than disappointing.”
“Immigrants are our neighbors, our business owners, our taxpayers, our communities, and the backbone of the Las Vegas community. Our caucus will not be silent while families are being targeted and pulled apart and our community being weakened and destabilized,” she continued.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BAM-1-1024x686.png,,,2025-06-24 10:02:53.367367

Isaacsohn, a 36-year-old representing the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods, is set to replace Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, as she steps down to allow new leadership to prepare for the midterms. She is term-limited after this General Assembly and is expected to announce her next move in the coming months.
The other leadership positions for the House Dems have changed, as well. If the full floor vote follows the caucus vote — state Rep. Phil Robinson, D-Solon, will be assistant leader, state Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna, will be whip, and state Rep. Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, will be assistant whip.
The millennial lawmaker Isaacsohn has risen to the top of the party since joining the legislature in 2023. He has been the whip since 2024 and is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. He also sits on the Finance and Energy committees. He focuses on affordable housing, education, government transparency and criminal justice reform.
He is a small business owner and created an organization called Cohear, focusing on community engagement. He attended Georgetown and received his law degree from Yale.
Isaacsohn will be one of the first Jewish leaders in state history. He helped create the Ohio Jewish Caucus, which includes five other legislators, including Brown Piccolantonio.

 The future of the Wilmington Neighborhood Conservancy Land Bank came under intense scrutiny Monday night as members of City Council’s Community Development & Urban Planning Committee clashed over whether to dissolve the entity,  and whether one of their own is being removed from the committee for demanding accountability.
The proposed ordinance, sponsored by Councilmember Shané Darby, would revoke the city’s authorization of the land bank, citing long-standing concerns about financial mismanagement, lack of transparency, and insider conflicts.
But the debate quickly veered into deeper controversy when Councilmember Coby Owens revealed he is being removed from the committee, and claimed it’s retaliation for his criticism of the land bank.
“This is probably going to be my last Community Development & Urban Planning meeting,” Owens said. “They went behind closed doors, had a meeting to remove me. They didn’t answer my questions with the land bank. They didn’t answer the questions on why they’re removing me from this committee.”
RELATED STORY: Residents protest after Council rejects rent stabilization in narrow vote
Owens has been among the land bank’s most vocal critics. He cited a 2024 performance audit from the city auditor that found failures across nearly every financial category, including delayed reports, unqualified staffing, and unvalidated reserves. The audit also noted the organization’s failure to complete timely financial documentation, including some records that were over a year late.
“They have misused funds,” Owens said. “And we have an official report from our city auditor that states that.”
Cabrera defends votes, sparking friction 
Owens directly questioned Councilmember Maria Cabrera — who sits on the land bank board — about her continued support for the agency despite the audit findings. Cabrera confirmed she voted to approve city funding for the land bank, even after the concerns were raised.
“You voted to give them money knowing there were financial issues raised by our own city auditor, correct?” Owens asked.
“Yes, I did,” Cabrera responded, adding that the city had committed $1.5 million to the land bank when it was created, but only delivered the full amount last year.

Cabrera defended the agency’s work in redeveloping vacant homes and stabilizing neighborhoods, especially on the city’s West Side and in Hilltop.
 “There are homeowners who bought them at an affordable price and are living there — single moms, grandmoms with their children,” she said.
But the exchange intensified an already strained debate, as Darby, Owens, and Hackett pushed back on what they described as a broken system that benefits well-connected nonprofits while sidelining ordinary residents.
Accusations of favoritism and gentrification 
Critics said the land bank has reserved properties for organizations whose leaders serve on the board, such as Habitat for Humanity, while declining to disclose who sits on its advisory board or why certain lots are designated “reserved.”
Owens, who represents Wilmington’s East Side, said homes transferred through the land bank in his district were selling for over $300,000 — far out of reach for most residents, whose average income is about $36,000.

“They’re not trying to get affordable housing for residents here in the city of Wilmington,” Owens said. “They’re trying to market this in the Philadelphia market to attract professionals.”
Several residents raised similar concerns during public comment, sharing experiences of being denied access to desirable homes or steered toward neglected properties in under-resourced neighborhoods. One mother described how her daughter tried for years to purchase land bank homes on Ninth Street, only to be directed elsewhere.
“They’re divvying out houses where they want you to live,” she said. “You’re not going to get those houses in areas where gentrification is happening.”
Land Bank accused of dodging Gibraltar oversight
Resident Maggie Messinger criticized the land bank’s handling of a Council resolution requiring a public hearing on the transfer of the historic Gibraltar mansion. Instead of a formal forum, she said, the land bank staged a neighborhood association presentation with glossy photos and no financial data, failing to address how over $3 million in taxpayer funds had been spent or how the mansion fit into the agency’s mission.
“The land bank is paying the bills, but no one knows what the plan is,” Messinger said. “Not one page in that shiny magazine had one piece of information about money.”
Council divided on a path forward
The ordinance calls for transferring land bank properties back to the city’s Department of Real Estate and Housing. Darby and Owens argue the move is necessary to rebuild a more transparent and equitable approach to housing development.
“They don’t deserve grace,” Owens said. “They haven’t done what they should be doing for our community.”
Councilmember Nathan Field and Councilmember Yolanda McCoy acknowledged oversight failures but said the city should focus on fixing the land bank rather than eliminating it.
“Fix it rather than end it,” Field said. McCoy added, “We dropped the ball-but we’re in a different term now. Let’s fix it.”
Council President Trippi Congo denied having supported Owens’ removal, but Owens insisted that internal Council emails confirmed efforts to sideline him and Hackett.

If passed, it would mark a dramatic shift in Wilmington’s housing strategy — and signal a rebuke of how the city has managed public land, redevelopment, and accountability.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WilmingtonLandBankMarketSt-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 10:02:53.367367

WILMINGTON — A planned replacement of gas flares at the Wilmington Wastewater Treatment Plant would increase air emissions due to a proposed switch to propane-fired pilot flames.
The plant, located at 12th Street and Hay Road, uses flares to burn off digester gas, a byproduct of sewage treatment. The proposed upgrade includes two elevated flares that will feature continuous pilot flames for safety. These pilots are small flames that stay lit to ensure the main flare can ignite as needed.
Originally, the city proposed that the pilot flames would be powered by digester gas, but it has since opted to use propane instead. According to DNREC, this change slightly increases emissions from the flare system.
“Basically, the city’s WWT facility has proposed replacing their existing flares with new flares to be fired by propane gas,” DNREC spokesperson Michael Globetti explained in an email to Delaware LIVE. 
According to Globetti, the city had originally planned for the flare pilots to run on digester gas, but later revised the application to use propane instead. The switch alters how the system operates and affects the air quality profile of the project. He explained, “This changed the emissions associated with the flare pilot, which would result in slightly increased emissions.”
If approved, the new flare system would be permitted to emit annually:


2.02 tons of particulate matter (PM, PM10, PM2.5)


4.60 tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx)


1.37 tons of sulfur dioxide (SO₂)


6.92 tons of carbon monoxide (CO)


0.49 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)


The flare replacement would also involve the installation of a 1,200-gallon propane tank. Internal correspondence between Jacobs and DNREC indicates that the emissions increase from the propane pilot is minimal and does not exceed regulatory limits.
Residents can inspect the applications or submit public comments or hearing requests until July 7, 2025. Requests for a hearing must include a familiarity with the application and a reasoned statement of its potential impact.
DNREC stated it will not provide additional comments. If a public hearing is requested and the DNREC Secretary decides it is warranted, the department would also withhold further comment until the public record is closed and a final permitting decision is made.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/wastewater-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 10:02:53.367367

(Stock photo by Tolgart/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina enters the 2026 campaign season without any state laws preventing political candidates from using artificial intelligence to make unfounded attacks against their opponents.
Twenty-five states now require disclosures when using AI in campaign materials or banned its use altogether, with a number of them passing their laws ahead of the 2024 election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
In the last presidential election cycle, GOP hopeful Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ campaign shared AI-generated images of President Donald Trump hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one-time chief medical adviser to the president, who is loathed by much of Trump’s base. And in New Hampshire, robocalls impersonating former President Joe Biden discouraged voters from casting their ballots in the state’s pre-South Carolina presidential primary.
The man responsible for spreading the calls was acquitted of charges related to voter suppression that could have sent him to prison for decades, according to The Associated Press.
South Carolina’s already-contentious gubernatorial race officially launched Monday, as the first two Republicans announced their bids.
Other Republicans expected to enter the fray include U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, which could create two wide-open races for Congress too. Other statewide races on the ballot in 2026 include U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham’s contested re-election bid.
Yet, in a state with a decades-old reputation for mud-slinging campaigns, there are no legal restrictions on using AI to take the political hijinks to a whole new level.
“We have seen a lot of meddling in our elections to help influence people,” said state Rep. Jermaine Johnson.
The Columbia Democrat has introduced legislation the last two years that would ban using AI in the three months before Election Day, unless the campaign material discloses that the image, video, or audio “has been manipulated or generated by artificial intelligence.”
AI will play a role in election misinformation. Experts are trying to fight back

Without that disclosure, if the campaign ads look or sound like the other person and intend to damage their reputation, the targeted candidate could seek damages in court. Violators could also be sentenced to up to 90 days in jail and fined $500, according to the latest proposal Johnson pre-filed last December for this year’s session.
As it stands, both the state Election Commission and Ethics Commission told the SC Daily Gazette there is little to limit the use of AI in campaign material.
AI in an SC election
In last year’s election for chief prosecutor of the 9th Circuit, made up of Berkeley and Charleston counties, incumbent Solicitor Scarlett Wilson used AI to mimic the voice of her opponent, former employee David Osborne, in a campaign ad.
A 30-second ad on local television and posted to Facebook last October included an AI-generated voice that was supposed to sound like Osborne reading emails he sent to Wilson, The Post and Courier reported.
“I think what made me comfortable is it was verbatim. It was his words” Wilson told the Gazette.
But Palmetto State Democrats were outraged.
Christale Spain, chair of the state Democratic Party, called for the State Law Enforcement Division to investigate, saying the emails were official communication between two employees. She contended that Wilson needed to file a public records request to be able to use the emails for political purposes.
Lachlan McIntosh, Osborne’s campaign consultant, called the ad, which used pieces of emails sent six months apart, “exceedingly unfair.” If the prosecutor had done that in court, he added, “the case would have been thrown out.”
SLED did not respond when asked if it investigated the video. Regardless, Wilson defeated Osborne by 22 points to keep the job she’s held since 2008.
Wilson said the outcry by Democrats brought more attention to the ad, working in her favor because it used his words.
Now in her fifth term, Wilson told the SC Daily Gazette as long as the claims being made are accurate, she has no issue with AI in campaigns.
However, she said, some guardrails are needed.
“It could be very dangerous,” she said. “I think I’d be fine with limits on it. As long as words and visuals are accurate … I think that should be fair game.”
When Johnson saw the advertisement, he said he went to colleagues and said, “I told you so.”

Neither of his bills has received any traction.
The latest was sent to the Judiciary Committee on the first day of session in January but has yet to receive a hearing. Since 2025 was the first of a two-year session, the proposal could still be heard next year without being re-filed.
When asked about the bill, House Judiciary Chairman Weston Newton said his committee received 469 bills last year and just didn’t have the time to properly vet them all.
“We’re in a new era. We’re in a new frontier regarding AI,” said the Bluffton Republican.
He pointed to bills criminalizing the use of AI to create child pornography — whether using actual or computer-generated photos of children. Another law passed this year criminalizes the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, to include fake images made through AI.
“The laws on the book years ago didn’t contemplate anything about AI,” Newton said. “So, there’s a whole host of issues we’re now beginning to talk about.”
Rep. Jeff Bradley, the head of the House regulatory and technology advisory committee, thinks Johnson’s proposal will likely get heard next year.
A federal ban?
But there’s a chance come January that the Legislature will no longer be able to consider Johnson’s bill, or any legislation with AI for that matter.
Included in the 1,000-plus page “Big Beautiful Bill” pushed by President Donald Trump that narrowly passed the House is a 10-year ban on passing regulations surrounding AI.
“No state or political subdivision thereof may enforce, during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, any law or regulation of that State or a political subdivision thereof limiting, restricting or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems or automated decision systems entered into interstate commerce,” the bill reads.
The proposal has exceptions for bills that remove legal impediments to AI, streamline its use or do not impose “substantiative design, performance, data-handling, documentation, civil liability, taxation” or fees on the rapidly evolving technology.
Attorneys general, including South Carolina’s Alan Wilson, and state legislators across the country have spoken out against the moratorium that has caused GOP in-fighting on Capitol Hill, according to reports.
South Carolina Rep. Brandon Guffey was the top signature on a letter signed by more than 260-state lawmakers urging Congress to remove the ban from the 1,000-plus page proposal.
The Rock Hill Republican testified in front of the U.S. Senate in February on a bill that required social media platforms to take down manipulated images and was recognized by Trump when he signed it into law.
Senate President Thomas Alexander, R-Walhalla, penned an op-ed with California state legislator Jacqui Irwin in Governing, an outlet geared towards government officials, also cautioning the potential impact of stripping power from legislators to regulate AI.
Alexander and Irwin are the leaders of the National Conference of State Legislatures’ Task Force on Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Privacy.
“The states are leading the way because our constituents have asked us to guard against the worst abuses and threats of AI,” the piece said. “Each of these laws — and hundreds more like them — were passed by legislatures on a broadly bipartisan basis. Yet each is now under threat of invalidation by a little-noticed provision in the reconciliation bill passed by the U.S. House.”
The mega-bill is under debate in the Senate, so the moratorium could be amended — or removed entirely. But if passed, it could eliminate the chance of regulating AI when it comes to South Carolina’s elections until 2035.
Lynn Teague with the League of Women Voters’ state chapter, said the AI ban frightens her because the technology is rapidly growing. And when it comes to voters, it’s only going to get easier to misinform them.
“The potential for misrepresentation, outright deception, with AI is so high,” Teague said. “We all know by the time something is out there in the public, correcting it becomes very hard.”
“An original lie spreads faster than the truth,” she added.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AI-computer-screen-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 10:02:53.367367

That’s in part because of a decision by Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins to reject the Missouri Gaming Commission’s emergency rules, which would have fast-tracked the rulemaking process.
Jan Zimmerman, chair of the Missouri Gaming Commission, said the emergency rule would have given highway patrol staff more time to complete the “extensive” process of investigating license applicants.
But Hoskins wrote in a statement that the regular process — including a public comment period and a review by a state committee — was needed to ensure “the people of Missouri are appropriately informed and have a say in the final decisions.”
In a constitutional amendment that voters narrowly approved last year to legalize sports betting in Missouri, the state was given a deadline of Dec. 1, 2025, to launch sports betting. The state is on track to meet that deadline, Zimmerman said.
The commission in May approved Missouri’s new sports betting rules, which “cover everything from processing license applications to disciplinary action,” Zimmerman said.
“Every phase of sports wagering allows us to provide oversight,” she added.
License applications are currently open. Zimmerman said “untethered” licenses, which go to operators not connected to a casino or stadium, will be issued in August while other licenses will be issued in November.
While “everyone is anxious for the end of baseball season (and) the beginning of football season,” Zimmerman said, “it’s important that the gaming commission staff get it right … Our responsibility is to protect the industry and the folks who work in the industry, but also to protect the citizens of Missouri.”
The state expects to collect about $28 million in tax revenue from sports betting annually. However, how much money will go to schools — a key selling point used during last year’s campaign — is still unclear.
Some of the taxes collected will first be used to cover the commission’s regulatory expenses, according to the amendment. After that, $5 million or 10% — whichever is more — will be sent to the Compulsive Gaming Prevention Fund. The rest will be used for K-12 and higher education.
 A new fund for problem gambling

The amendment created the Compulsive Gaming Prevention Fund, which is distinct from the Missouri Department of Mental Health’s Compulsive Gamblers Fund.
Overseen by the state treasurer and managed by the Gaming Commission, the new fund will help provide compulsive gambling counseling and support services, develop problem-gambling treatment and prevention programs and distribute grants to organizations that help people with compulsive gambling problems.
Unlike other state appropriations — which, if unspent, typically go back to the general revenue fund — this fund will roll over into following years.
That’s a critical part of addressing compulsive gambling in the state, according to Keith Spare, chair of the Kansas City Port Authority Problem Gambling Advisory Committee and the Missouri Alliance to Curb Problem Gambling.
“In the case of this $5 million, if it is not spent, it stays in the fund to be spent later. That’s incredible, because that means you have something to plan on,” he said. “Missouri funding will now be, for the first time in history, secure for problem gambling.”
Roughly 3.1 million Missourians participate in some form of gambling each year, according to a 2022 study. About 200,000 met the criteria for a gambling disorder and another million met enough criteria to be considered at-risk.
An estimated 1.2% of adults globally have a gambling disorder. In the United States, the legalization of gambling and the proliferation of sports betting have made compulsive gambling — which experts consider an addiction similar to alcohol and drugs — more widespread, especially among young men.
New data suggests that when a state legalizes gambling, the number of bankruptcies rises between 20% and 35%. Financial hardship is one of the main reasons that nationally, an estimated one in five compulsive gamblers considers or attempts suicide, said Spare, a retired substance use and compulsive gambling counselor.
With sports betting going live in Missouri this year, Spare and other experts are worried that outcomes like bankruptcy and suicide will become more severe even if the number of people with gambling disorders doesn’t rise much.
“When you have the prevalence of gambling online — and this is going to be largely online — you have the ability to gamble day and night, basically in a private setting,” he added. “That’s putting gas on a fire.”
 A fresh start?

The money allocated to the Compulsive Gaming Prevention Fund will help the state better serve people with compulsive gambling problems. But Spare’s main concern is whether the department — which he said “has largely abandoned problem gamblers” — will spend the money effectively.
“I’ve said to (the department) from the beginning: ‘You need an advisory committee. You need people who can tell you what’s a good idea, what’s not a good idea, and here’s how to do it,’” he said.  “But like they’ve done all along, they want to do what they want to do and not have any public input.”
The Missouri Department of Mental Health repeatedly declined requests for an interview and only replied to one of several questions sent by The Beacon.
In that response, a spokesperson wrote that the new fund is managed by the Gaming Commission, but that in the recently approved state budget, the General Assembly approved $4 million from the fund to go to the Department of Mental Health.
That money includes $1.5 million for “prevention and education services,” $500 thousand for “adult psychiatric services” and $2 million for “treatment of alcohol and drug abuse.”
Spare said that although the Department of Mental Health requested some money from the older fund — the Compulsive Gamblers Fund — for several years, “last year, they drew down nothing.”
He said that when he asked the department’s director of behavioral health, Nora Bock, about her division’s limited use of the fund, he was told, “‘Well, my counselors don’t know that there’s many gamblers out there.’”
“Well, that’s all in how you ask the question,” Spare told The Beacon. “If you say, ‘Do you have a gambling problem?’ every gambler is going to say no … Her opinion is that if there isn’t a lot of demand (for counseling), there isn’t a lot of problem gambling. Well, that doesn’t mean people aren’t dying.”
The department did not respond to The Beacon’s questions about Spare’s concerns.
Spare said a major reason for low demand for help is a lack of awareness that is due, in part, to the fact that counseling and other services are only advertised on casino, lottery and sports betting ads.
“There’s a difference between marketing to get gamblers in treatment … (and) traditional advertising for casinos and the lottery,” he said. “You need to find a way to get advertising to the general public and to the gamblers about when this is a problem, why it’s a problem and what to do about it.”
He said the state has spent decades “getting alcohol and drug abuse to be recognizable” so that people can identify the warning signs of addiction in their loved ones and help them find care, but “there’s nothing like that for problem gambling.”
“We need advertising that says not to gamble, to be aware that if you do gamble, these are the problem signs, and if you see them in your family member or neighbor or co-worker, raise the alarm,” Spare said.
 Accessing care

Even for those who do seek help, state resources are limited, Spare said.
Nine agencies have contracts with the Department of Mental Health to provide compulsive gambling counseling services at no cost to qualifying Missourians. However, of those, only six have a certified gambling disorder counselor on staff.
Calls to the 1-888-BETSOFF number are routed to these counselors. In the Kansas City region, the state has partnered with University Health in Kansas City and Family Guidance Center in St. Joseph.
Jordyn Johnston, an alcohol and drug counselor at University Health, is also a gambling disorder counselor, providing in-person and remote counseling for people living anywhere in Missouri.
She currently works with eight compulsive gambling patients and said she has seen demand increase over time, particularly in rural areas.
Part of that increase could stem from the legalization of sports betting in Kansas in 2022, with many Missourians crossing the border to place wagers.
“I live on the Kansas side, and I actually see people pulled off on the 435 ramp on Saturday mornings, placing their bets,” Johnston said. “There’ll be like five to 10 cars lined up on those off-ramps.”
As demand for services increases, it places more strain on the state’s gambling disorder counselors, many of whom are also alcohol and substance use counselors. While Johnston works with eight patients with a gambling disorder, she works with 35 to 40 patients with substance use disorder.
She said that as the state prepares for another potential increase in the number of people seeking care for gambling disorders, she’s hopeful that University Health and other organizations will bring on more counselors.
Spare said Oklahoma offers a virtual training for problem gambling counseling that, for a $4,000 annual fee, an unlimited number of Missouri-based counselors can attend. But he said the Department of Mental Health hasn’t expressed much interest in the Oklahoma program.
While the state hotline refers people to the handful of agencies that have partnered with the state, there are other counselors across Missouri, Spare said. Port KC’s Problem Gambling Advisory Committee paid for dozens to be trained in the last few years alone.
The problem, he said, is that there isn’t a comprehensive list of public and private counselors able to provide problem gambling care, which makes it harder to find a local counselor or gauge how well the current supply of counselors could keep up with a potential increase in demand.
Johnston said that if people with gambling disorders aren’t able to access care, the repercussions could be dire for them and their families.
“The rate of suicide is increasingly high for those people, because gambling is an addiction where it doesn’t really have those outward symptoms. … A lot of the things that they go through are really hidden, and even their family doesn’t know,” she said.
“A lot of it is financial problems — they’re in so much debt, they’ve gambled away their house, and they really feel like there’s no other option left, (like) there’s nothing else for them and suicide is the only option,” she added.
 Building a better sports betting system

Spare said Missouri could learn from neighbors like Kansas and Oklahoma, which pay for specialists and counselors statewide and offer a hotline staffed by trained gambling counselors.
“In Missouri, we have a hotline paid for by the gaming industry that’s answered by college students … All they try to do is make referrals,” he said.
Asked what the state should do with its new fund, Spare advocated for a full range of services, including individual and family counseling, inpatient treatment and “first and foremost, an advertising campaign … that gets people to come for treatment.”
He also pushed for a “no wrong door” approach through which mental health and substance use counselors are also trained to provide gambling disorder care so that “wherever someone shows up looking for care, it’s available.”
That care must also be long-term, Spare said, likening it to addressing substance use disorder.
“Addiction is a mental disease. It’d be like saying, ‘We’re going to give you six weeks of medicine for schizophrenia and then we’re not going to worry about you,’ he said. “It’s crazy, but some people think that way: ‘Why aren’t you over it? Why don’t you quit? Why did you start again?’ Because it’s an addiction.”

(USDA NRCS photo)The nutrition and agriculture sections of the reconciliation bill under consideration by the U.S. Senate threaten to do more harm than good for Alaska’s food systems. While some provisions may offer benefits for agriculture nationwide, the bill — when applied to Alaska’s unique landscape — projects a net loss for our state.
At a time when prices and uncertainty are at all-time highs, and we have one of the highest percentages of farmers who’ve farmed less than 10 years in the nation, Alaska’s food producers and vulnerable families need meaningful support. This bill instead shifts resources away from small farms, undermines nutrition programs and imposes new costs on a state still recovering from the pandemic. It also risks delaying or derailing the farm bill reauthorization — essential to Alaska’s food security.
Nutrition cuts will deepen hunger in Alaska
Proposed changes to nutrition programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will have devastating consequences for food security in Alaska. The bill mandates a “cost-neutral” approach to the Thrifty Food Plan — limiting SNAP benefit levels to inflation. This ignores the state’s exceptionally high food costs. 
In 2023, Alaska’s food retailers—including grocery stores and farmers markets—brought in $281 million in SNAP dollars, directly supporting local economies and families. Undermining this support puts both at risk.
Work requirements are another red flag. Lowering the age exemption for dependent children to 10 years old is not just tone-deaf — it’s dangerous. With limited child care options across the state, these rules force impossible choices, especially for single parents.
Additionally, requiring a 10% unemployment rate to waive work mandates ignores rural job scarcity; only a few regions in Alaska meet that threshold, yet many face equally dire employment prospects. The bill also removes bipartisan exemptions for veterans, homeless individuals, and former foster youth — groups for whom SNAP is a lifeline.
The bill penalizes SNAP recipients for receiving energy or internet assistance. In rural Alaska, where basic utilities are costly and connectivity is essential, this change effectively asks families to choose between food, heat and access to opportunity.
A proposed 15% cost shift to states for SNAP benefits would saddle Alaska with an estimated $37 million in additional costs — on top of new administrative burdens. These costs will worsen cost-shifting to municipalities, and reduce services for families.
Eliminating the SNAP-Ed program further undermines health equity. In 2024 alone, Alaska’s SNAP-Ed program reached nearly 14,000 residents with proven success in promoting healthier diets. Cutting it directly contradicts the administration’s health goals.
Hunger doesn’t go away because we turn our backs. 
Agricultural provisions leave Alaska behind
Despite headlines touting support for agriculture, the bill’s farm programs prioritize large-scale commodity producers. Alaska’s small and independent farmers are left with crumbs. Expanded subsidies for commodity crops like corn and soy offer little to a state where fewer than 3% of farms qualify, and where not a single Agriculture Risk Coverage or Price Loss Coverage payment was issued in 2023. These programs provide funding to farmers whose income falls below certain levels, but only for a limited set of commodities. 
Crop insurance, too, largely bypasses Alaska, serving fewer than 10 producers annually. While we appreciate provisions to expand beginning farmer support and Whole Farm Revenue Protection — an insurance program that helps farms manage risk — they don’t offset the broader imbalance.
The bill cancels funds from conservation programs through the Natural Resource Conservation Service, which have been critical in Alaska for high tunnels, soil management, crop studies, and so much more. Proposed investments in agricultural research are welcome, but match requirements and competitive processes disadvantage Alaska’s relatively small institutions like the University of Alaska Fairbanks Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station. Without reforms, these funds will continue to bypass our research institutions.
We need policy that reflects Alaska’s reality
From Nome to the Mat-Su to Ketchikan, Alaskans are building vibrant, resilient food systems — but we need federal partners and policy that reflects our state’s realities. Alaska’s producers operate on small plots of land, in extreme climates, with vulnerable supply chains and limited infrastructure. Our food assistance programs are lifelines, not luxuries. Food pantries and food banks across Alaska are already stretched beyond their limits. 
We believe Congress should listen to the lived experience of Alaskans and amend this reconciliation bill to protect nutrition programs, preserve state flexibility, invest equitably in small farms, and defend the critical groundwork laid by the farm bill. The wide scope of potential impacts across Alaska’s food systems makes clear the reconciliation bill must reflect the realities on the ground here. If not, our communities, food producers, businesses, and families will bear the consequences.

In 2023, the most recent year with data available, Minnesota’s age-adjusted death rate was 681.7 per 100,000, compared to 649.2 in 2019 […]","Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.Deaths in Minnesota declined for the second year in a row in 2023, but mortality’s still higher than it was in 2019, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2023, the most recent year with data available, Minnesota’s age-adjusted death rate was 681.7 per 100,000, compared to 649.2 in 2019 and 756.5 at the pandemic’s peak in 2021.

This mirrors nationwide trends, though Minnesota’s death rate is lower than the national one. Relative to the United States as a whole, Minnesota has a low poverty rate and strong access to health care. In 2023, 3.8% of Minnesotans were uninsured, compared to 7.6% of Americans.
Still, the data underscore Minnesota’s vast and longstanding disparities in health and other outcomes of well-being. The mortality rate among Black and Indigenous Minnesotans was higher to begin with and rose more sharply during the pandemic. Across the country, Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to experience unemployment and to live in poverty, both of which are correlated with an increased risk of death. These economic gaps are especially stark in Minnesota, which is by many measures one of the nation’s least racially equitable states. 
The pandemic served to reinforce the disparities. People of color were more likely to work jobs that involve a high risk of COVID-19 exposure and less likely to have adequate access to medical care. The latter was especially true of Indigenous Americans who live on reservations. Researchers at the University of Minnesota studied neighborhood-level death rates before and during the outbreak of COVID-19. They found that in general, death rates were higher in poorer neighborhoods. Members of racial minorities are much more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Before the pandemic, though, people of color living in disadvantaged neighborhoods were actually less likely to die than white residents of the same neighborhoods. But the COVID-19 death rate was higher for people of color even when controlling for geography. 

For all racial groups, however, the overall death rate fell in 2022 and 2023 — but remained elevated. COVID is one driver. While the COVID-19 death rate in Minnesota has plummeted since the height of the pandemic — from 71.9 per 100,000 people in 2021 to 12 in 2023 — it’s still obviously higher than in 2019. And not all of the increase in mortality during the pandemic was from the disease itself. In 2022, researchers at the Mayo Clinic released a paper studying changes in Minnesota mortality in 2020. They found that gun homicides, accidental poisoning, malnutrition, alcoholic liver disease and other types of liver disease also increased.
As the pandemic waned, not all of these causes of death declined as dramatically as COVID. In fact, as of 2023, deaths from starvation and non-alcoholic chronic liver disease were trending upward. 

Rates of food insecurity started rising in 2020 and haven’t stopped, with the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families reporting that food shelf visits increased for the fourth straight year in 2024, bringing them to 2.5 times the pre-pandemic number. Households of color and those with school-aged children are more likely to experience food insecurity. The Mayo Clinic study, however, found that those most vulnerable to malnutrition deaths were women 85 years and older, white women, and rural residents. Older people who needed help eating were particularly at risk during the pandemic. The Star Tribune reported on multiple cases of nursing home residents who stopped eating during COVID isolation and starved to death.  
Firearm homicides, on the other hand, were more common in inner cities. Nationally, the murder rate has fallen each year since 2020, reaching pre-pandemic levels in 2024. But Minneapolis hasn’t yet seen a similar decline. The murder rate in the city has remained high since the pandemic and rose slightly in 2024, though early numbers show that it is trending down this year. 
There’s some evidence that more Americans began drinking heavily during the pandemic, resulting in more alcohol-related deaths. But nationally and in the state, binge drinking and alcohol-related deaths have been trending upward since well before 2020. 
Minnesota’s binge drinking rate is one of the nation’s highest.

Many age groups have seen elevated death rates in the wake of the pandemic, even those less likely to die of COVID. Infant mortality rates, for example, increased during the pandemic and remain slightly higher than they were, though infants are very unlikely to die of COVID. Reduced access to medical care may be responsible, as maternal mortality rates also increased. But the increase in mortality is most pronounced among older Americans, who made up 90% of COVID-19 deaths in 2023.
Overall, the data shows that bringing the death rate down to pre-pandemic levels will take more than controlling one disease. It will require attacking the root causes of excess deaths, such as food insecurity, social isolation, and inadequate health care access, with special attention paid to vulnerable populations such as seniors and those giving birth.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1217649916.jpg,,,2025-06-24 09:06:35.408138

Fifty high school and 12 middle school students participated in themed workshops taught by published authors. The students submitted short stories, poems and novel excerpts to their instructors and peers for feedback.
Courtlandt Willingham, a Jackson native and rising junior at Mississippi School of the Arts in Brookhaven, described the workshop process as, “listen, ask questions and write.”
Willingham attended a workshop themed around folklore and mythmaking, and that provided inspiration for his poetry.
He said folklore means different things depending on the person.
“Folklore, to me, is a collection of ideas about being a Mississippian — especially a Black Mississippian,” Willingham said.

The residential workshop took place June 9-13. One day, campers attended a private craft talk and keynote speech by Jack Davis, who won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for history for his book, “The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea.”
Keynote speakers in previous years included acclaimed authors Kiese Laymon, Joyce Carol Oates and Angie Thomas.
“These young people will ask keynote authors questions that are not the standard, boring questions that adults ask,” said Jamie Dickson, a workshop instructor. He said the visiting writers are not condescending to young people.
“Someone who is truly invested in literature really understands that there’s a lot of truth to the cliche: ‘This is the next generation of writers,’” Dickson said.
Students attended lectures on screenwriting techniques, the Afrofuturism genre and the connection between artmaking and political life.
They spent an afternoon touring the Eudora Welty House and Garden.
“I’ve been in the garden before,” said Hannah King, a rising freshman at Belhaven University. “I went into the garden and wrote a poem about it. I hadn’t been able to finish it. But when I went back there, I was able to finish it — because I was touring the house.”
Instructors took students to other Jackson cultural sites, including the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, the Mississippi Museum of Art, Lemuria book store and the COFO Civil Rights Education Center at Jackson State University. 
Campers at Millsaps cheered and drumrolled as their instructors went up to the podium to read in front of a handwritten poster proclaiming “Open Mic Night.”
“I think Open Mic is everyone’s favorite night,” said Syd Clay, a rising sophomore at Northwest Rankin High School. 
“It’s just fun being able to have a community that you can share things with,” Clay said. “My class this year was mainly first-years, and they were all really nervous about the Open Mic. But, at the end of the night, they all loved it.”

Honey bees across the country are under attack from tiny, eight-legged parasitic mites. These mites burrow between the segments of the bees’ adult bodies or invade their larvae and infect them with viruses — deforming their wings and leaving them flightless.
That’s not only problematic for the bees — whose entire colonies can collapse from a mite invasion — but also for California, which relies on the bees for its food production and economy. 
Earlier this month the state Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill that would direct the California Department of Food and Agriculture to establish a health program for managed honey bees. The department would work with beekeepers, farmers, scientists and other stakeholders to provide grants for projects and research that support managed honey bees.
Honey bees are essential for pollinating almonds, which are a lucrative multibillion-dollar industry. The bees also produced 13.3 million pounds of honey in 2024, or nearly 10% of the country’s supply, valued at $32.8 million.
But beginning in the late 1980s, Varroa mites native to Asia began infiltrating bee colonies in the U.S. By the early 2000s, they were “in everyone’s hives,” said Ryan Burris, the president of the California State Beekeepers Association.
Pesticides and other pest management methods stabilized the bee population over the decades. But commercial honey bee deaths have been soaring in the U.S. in recent years, and the reason why remains unclear. Between June 2024 and March 2025, beekeepers lost 1.6 million colonies — an average of 62% of their colonies.
The proposed program would provide grants to help beekeepers and farmers plant more crops or purchase probiotics to improve the bees’ health, among other things.
The bill is currently before the Senate Agriculture Committee, where it could be considered as early as mid-July.

Newsom slows roll on return to office mandate

From CalMatters deputy editor Adam Ashton:
Gov. Gavin Newsom is open to giving California public employees a temporary break on his return-to-office mandate.
The union representing about 14,000 state engineers made a deal that delays the four-day-a-week order for one year. It was supposed to take effect July 1.
The Professional Engineers in California Government disclosed that agreement alongside a new contract that includes some concessions Newsom wanted to trim payroll expenses as he tries to shore up a $12 billion budget deficit.
Workers represented by the union will get a 3% raise next week, but it’d be offset by mandatory unpaid time off that would basically negate the pay increase for two years. That’s similar to the terms of a deal Newsom made last week with the union representing state prison guards.

Ted Toppin, PECG’s executive director: “These two agreements are the best terms possible for our members at this time. … The PECG Team worked hard to deliver on the items that are most important to PECG members and make improvements in their pay and benefits, despite challenging times.”

Newsom embraced telework policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. He brought public employees back to the office twice-a-week last year, and ordered a bigger move to four-days-a-week in May.

Congress follows up on CalMatters investigation

After CalMatters and The Markup published an investigation in April that found that Covered California shared enrollees’ personal data with LinkedIn, Congress is demanding answers.
As Colin Lecher and Tomas Apodaca explain, Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives sent a letter last week to the executive director of the state’s health insurance marketplace expressing their concern about the “the privacy and security implications” revealed by the investigation.
When visitors filled out forms on Covered California’s website, trackers sent information to LinkedIn, including information about whether visitors were blind, pregnant, used a high number of prescription drugs or reported that they were transgender or possible victims of domestic abuse. The data tracking operated for more than a year.
Since the publication of the story, most ad trackers have been removed from the site, and Covered California said it paused its use of trackers entirely. Four other state-run health care sites were also found to be sharing information with tech companies.

 Catherine Blakespear
State Sen. Catherine Blakespear, an Encinitas Democrat, represents California’s 38th Senate District.


Californians are tired and angry about the seemingly intractable, unsheltered, street homelessness crisis. 
After serving in elected office for 12 years, I have been frustrated by the many boxes that we’ve put around ourselves as policymakers that somehow justify allowing people to suffer, degrade and ultimately die in front of us, while our public spaces become living spaces for other humans. 
It’s a terrible reality for everyone. In the last decade more than 50,000 people died nationwide after living on the streets. This is unacceptable! 
Now, for the first time in years, there is growing recognition that we can end unsheltered homelessness, if we expand our concept of acceptable housing to be broader than someone’s forever home. There are a number of interim solutions between living unsheltered on the street and permanent housing. 
One proven scalable solution for building interim supportive housing is using temporarily vacant land and modular, relocatable cabins. These are not the “shelters” of the past. These are quick-build, clean, safe, modest housing units that provide shelter from the elements and have social workers on site. 
Wide-scale adoption of this interim housing would mean our streets aren’t a waiting room anymore for the 187,000 unsheltered homeless people in California. Interim housing can be constructed for as little as $50,000 a unit, compared to an average cost of $650,000 for a permanent housing unit. 
Some cities are leading the way. San Jose is on track to open 1,400 beds within 18 months — including more than 800 modular interim housing units — in stark contrast to taking the four to seven years, which is standard for traditional affordable housing projects. 
One of the pernicious problems in tackling homelessness in the real world is the “where” question. NIMBY-ism, bureaucratic hurdles, lawsuits and political jousting can lead to the inaccurate perception that nowhere in an entire city is the right place to build a small, homeless-serving housing project. This is absurd. 
We need to be more open-minded in considering locations. Urban landowners own undeveloped or under-developed parcels slated for future investments that could host shorter-term interim projects. 
Large parking lots that can be repurposed for a quick-build project are everywhere when you start to look — from aging shopping malls, to city civic centers, to community college campuses, to fairgrounds, to Caltrans park & ride lots. 
Old hotels and motels already provide separated rooms. 
And we need everyone to get on board — leaders in politics, business, labor, environment and community preservation. We should demand a goal of getting to functional zero in unsheltered street homelessness and that we have a plan to get there. 
Two bills this year — one by me (SB 16) and one from state Senator Josh Becker (SB 606) — would bolster this framework. The state and its regions would be required to develop a plan to reach and maintain functional zero for unsheltered homelessness, and they would be held accountable to use the tools the state has provided, including the Shelter Crisis Act passed in 2020 and the Low-Barrier Navigation Center law passed in 2019.
 We could make this happen by legislating property tax breaks, city incentives like the Regional Housing Needs Allocation credit, security and sanitation commitments from cities, flexible funding and automatic “by-right” approvals when projects satisfy zoning and local ordinances.
That could be paired with a requirement that all 500-plus cities and counties in the state participate in the provision of  in-patient treatment and interim housing.
Today, unfortunately, the preponderance of state funding comes with rigid restrictions that tie the money exclusively to permanent housing “exits.” For example, the state’s Homekey+ program specifies that “ineligible uses include: Interim Housing.” 
Read More: Federal DEI, ‘wokeness’ restrictions put California homeless providers in a bind
The latest state Encampment Resolution Funds program now requires that any interim use must be accompanied by a concrete plan to move individuals into permanent housing. 
These restrictions prevent pragmatic interim solutions to bring people in off the streets fast and cost effectively. Cities should be empowered to use state funds for interim solutions.
Interim housing does not end all types of homelessness for all people at all stages. We still need to build enough permanent housing to end the housing crisis. 
But unsheltered homelessness is the most devastating. And it is actually solvable in the near term when we expand our definition of housing to include “housing now.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062325-San-Jose-Tiny-Homes-BANG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-24 09:06:35.408138

Can Central Valley lawmakers save them?,Lynn La,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/06/california-honey-bee-varroa-mites/,"Honey bees, a critical component of California’s agriculture, face several challenges to survival. Will the Legislature spend more money in a deficit year to try and address the problems facing the bees?","In summary
Honey bees, a critical component of California’s agriculture, face several challenges to survival. Will the Legislature spend more money in a deficit year to try and address the problems facing the bees?


Honey bees across the country are under attack from tiny, eight-legged parasitic mites. These mites burrow between the segments of the bees’ adult bodies or invade their larvae and infect them with viruses — deforming their wings and leaving them flightless.
That’s not only problematic for the bees — whose entire colonies can be destroyed by an unchecked mite invasion — but also for California, which relies on the bees for its food production and economy. 
Earlier this month the state Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill that would direct the California Department of Food and Agriculture to establish a health program for managed honey bees. The department would work with beekeepers, farmers, scientists, agricultural commissioners and other stakeholders to provide grants for projects and research that support managed honey bees.
“Without our honey bees, we are at risk of losing jobs and a huge part of our economy,” said Assemblymember Rhodesia Ransom, a Stockton Democrat and co-author of the bill author. “This (bill) is integral at maintaining our ability to be self-sustaining and contributing to healthy foods in the U.S. and across the world.” 
Another Central Valley lawmaker, Republican Assemblymember Heather Hadwick of Redding, co-authored the bill.
Honey bees and mites
Compared to carpenter bees or bumble bees, honey bees are much more manageable pollinators that build stronger and bigger colonies. They’re essential for pollinating California’s most lucrative crops, including cherries, melons and almonds. California almonds are a multibillion-dollar industry, and the pollination of California almond orchards serves as the largest honey bee migration in the world. 
In 2024, California bees also produced 13.3 million pounds of honey — nearly 10% of the country’s supply — valued at $32.8 million.
But beginning in the late 1980s, Varroa mites originally native to Asia began infiltrating bee colonies in the U.S. By the early 2000s, they were “in everyone’s hives,” said Ryan Burris, the president of the California State Beekeepers Association and a third generation beekeeper.

Pesticides and other pest management methods stabilized the bee population over the decades somewhat. But commercial honey bee deaths have been soaring in the U.S. in recent years, and the reason why remains unclear. Between June 2024 and March 2025, beekeepers lost 1.6 million colonies — an average of 62% of their colonies. This nationwide scarcity has also given rise to more beehive thefts. 
Besides the mites, honey bees are threatened by pesticides, habitat loss and a lack of food and nutrition. Each hazard presents its own problems, but the mites in particular have vexed beekeepers. 
Killing the mites with pesticides is complex: The mites have grown resistant to some chemicals, so beekeepers have to routinely swap out different pesticides while trying to avoid contaminating the bees’ honey with large doses of chemicals. The financial losses due to mites can be staggering, according to Burris.
“There’s a time when you’re treating, treating, treating. You want to give the bees a break but the mites just come back,” Burris said. “They blow up, and all the money you spent trying to save and treat the bees is out the door. It’s totally disheartening because this is our livelihood. A hive can get you almond pollination money; pollination money off of other crops; and honey.”
A health program for bees
The Managed Honeybee Health Program proposed by Ransom and Hadwick would provide grants to help beekeepers and farmers plant more crops for bees to forage on; buy feed; or purchase probiotics to improve the bees’ health, among other things
The program would be funded either through the state, nonstate, federal and private funds or a combination. Funding for the grants would likely range in the hundreds of thousands of dollars to the low millions, while operating costs, such as staff to manage contracts, would cost in the low hundreds of thousands, according to Carson Knight, a legislative aide for Ransom’s office.
While there is no formal opposition to the proposal, securing the funding could be a tough sell for lawmakers as they grapple with a $12 billion budget shortfall.
The bill is currently before the Senate Agriculture Committee, where it could be considered as early as mid-July. Until then, Burris said he is crossing his fingers that the measure, if signed into law, will help the beekeeping industry.

When Hank Woolley, a paleontological researcher who specializes in lizard evolution, opened a jar of bones labeled “lizard” at the Natural History Museum of Utah, he said his first thought was, “Oh wow, there’s a fragmentary skeleton here.” 
“We know very little about large-bodied lizards from the Kaiparowits Formation in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, so I knew this was significant right away,” said Woolley, from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County’s Dinosaur Institute. 
With Woolley’s expertise, that jar of bones — even though it was collected back in 2005 — helped lead to a new discovery of a “racoon-sized armored monstersaurian,” a giant relative of the Gila monster, according to an announcement issued last week by the University of Utah. 
Inspired by a Middle Earth monster
Its name, Bolg amondol, was inspired by a “goblin prince” villain in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” universe. Bolg now represents an “evolutionary lineage that sprouted within a group of large-bodied lizards called monstersaurs that still roam the deserts from which Bolg was recovered,” according to the U. 
Woolley knew that a new species of monstersaur called for an appropriate name from an “iconic monster creator”: Tolkien, the university said in its release. 
“Bolg is a great sounding name. It’s a goblin prince from ‘The Hobbit,’ and I think of these lizards as goblin-like, especially looking at their skulls,” Woolley said.

He also used Tolkien’s fictional Elvish language Sindarin to craft the species’ epithet. “Amon” means “mound,” and “dol” means “head,” a reference to mound-like osteoderms (or bony deposits that act as a form of armor) found on Bolg’s and other monstersaurs’ skulls. 
“‘Mound-headed Bolg’ would fit right in with the goblins — and it’s revealing quite a bit about monstersaurs,” the U. said. 
‘Hidden treasures’ await in museum fossil collections
The research published June 17 in the journal Royal Society Open Science, led by the Dinosaur Institute in Los Angeles County and the Natural History Museum of Utah, “reveals hidden treasures awaiting future paleontologists in the bowels of museum fossil collections,” the university said, along with “the vast potential of paleontological heritage preserved in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and other public lands.” 
The field collection of the specimens were conducted under paleontological permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management, which also helped fund the study with a National Science Foundation award.

Though the Bolg specimen was first unearthed more than a decade ago, in 2005, Woolley’s expertise in lizard paleontology helped determine its significance. He was the lead author of the research. 
“Bolg is a great example of the importance of natural history museum collections,” said co-author Randy Irmis, an associate professor at the U. and curator of paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Utah, in the news release. “Although we knew the specimen was significant when it was discovered back in 2005, it took a specialist in lizard evolution like Hank to truly recognize its scientific importance and take on the task of researching and scientifically describing this new species.”
Though museum collection spaces are “sometimes stereotyped as dusty, forgotten places, the truth is quite the opposite,” the Natural History Museum of Utah said in a post about Bolg last week. The museum’s paleontology collection is a “glorified storage unit. Instead, it’s a space where staff, students, volunteers, and visiting researchers can care for fossils and conduct new research.”
“It was this reevaluation of collection specimens,” the museum added, “that led to Woolley’s breakthrough research on Bolg amondol.”

Bolg sheds light on lizard evolution mysteries
Irmis said discovering a new species of lizard that’s an ancestor of the modern-day Gila monster is “pretty cool in and of itself, but what’s particularly exciting is what it tells us about the unique 76-million-year-old ecosystem it lived in.” 
“The fact that Bolg co-existed with several other large lizard species indicates that this was a stable and productive ecosystem where these animals were taking advantage of a wide variety of prey and different micro-habitats,” Irmis said. 
Researchers identified the new species from a collection of skull, limbs, vertebrae and bony armor called osteoderms. Most fossil lizards from the dinosaur age “are even scrappier — often just single, isolated bones or teeth — so despite their fragmentary nature, the parts of Bolg’s skeleton that survived contain a stunning amount of information,” the U. said. 
“That means more characteristics are available for us to assess and compare to similar-looking lizards,” Woolley said. “Importantly, we can use those characteristics to understand this animal’s evolutionary relationships and test hypotheses about where it fits on the lizard tree of life.”
The clade (or ancestral grouping) of anguimorph lizards known as monstersauria are characterized by their large size and distinctive features, like “sharp, spire-like teeth and pitted, polygonal armor attached to their skulls.” 
Bolg, the U. said, “would have been a bit of a monster to our eyes.”

“Three feet tip to tail, maybe even bigger than that, depending on the length of the tail and torso,” Woolley said. “So, by modern lizard standards they’re a very large animal, similar in size to a Savannah monitor lizard; something that you wouldn’t want to mess around with.”
Monstersauria have a roughly 100-million-year history, but their fossil record is largely incomplete, meaning Bolg’s discovery is a “big deal” to help fully understand the prehistoric lizards and their world, the university said. 
“Bolg’s closest known relative hails from the other side of the planet in the Gobi Desert of Asia,” the U. said. “Though dinosaurs have long been known to have traveled between the once-connected continents of the Late Cretaceous Period, Bolg reveals that smaller animals also made the trek, suggesting there were common patterns of biogeography across terrestrial vertebrates during this time.”
Where was Bolg uncovered?
Bolg was discovered in the rocks of the Kaiparowits Formation of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument — a formation that has emerged as a paleontological hotspot over the past 25 years, according to the U. 
Those rocks have produced “one of the most astounding dinosaur-dominated records in North America,” the university said. “Discoveries like this underscore the importance of preserving public lands in the Western U.S. for science and research.”
Co-author Joe Sertich, from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and Colorado State University, said in the release that the “exceptional record of big lizards” from Grand Staircase-Escalante “may prove to be a normal part of dinosaur-dominated ecosystems from North America.”
He said those lizards appear to have filled “key roles as smaller predators hunting down eggs and small animals in the forests of Laramidia,” which is an island continent that existed during the Late Cretaceous period.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum acknowledged the importance of public land in the west during remarks to the Western Governors’ Association on Monday, but did not address the prospect of 250 million acres of Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service land becoming eligible for sale under the proposed federal budget making its way through Congress.
Changes to Senate Republicans’ budget proposal means even more Utah public land could be sold

Nor did any of the western governors ask him about the Congressional Republican proposal when Burgum took their questions. The secretary did not take questions from the media and, as of publication, press availability with him had not been announced.
Originally scheduled to speak later in the day, Burgum instead swapped places with Education Secretary Linda McMahon. A protest against the sale of public lands timed to Burgum’s original speaking time proceeded as planned.
Former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a Democratic candidate in New Mexico’s 2026 governor’s race, released a statement Monday denouncing the GOP proposal and said Burgum “should answer to New Mexicans while he visits our state and explain why he prioritizes corporate greed over New Mexico’s wellbeing.”
In his remarks, Burgum, a former governor of North Dakota, noted his belief that “the only people that should ever be head of Interior are people who’ve already been a western governor,” and noted that states such as New Mexico, Montana and Wyoming—to name a few—“are more than geographic destinations.” They aren’t “snow globes,” he said. “One of my messages here to all of you today is one of abundance…you can have amazing national parks, national historic sites, national monuments, you can work collaboratively with the tribes…and you can still contribute mightily to the nation’s economy and the nation’s security.”
Burgum returned to the theme of “abundance” in remarks about energy and what he characterized as the United States’ over-dependence on China for “critical minerals.” That “lopsided” dependence, he said, works against environmental concerns, contending that “if you care about the environment, do it in the U.S., because we do this stuff cleaner, smarter and safer than anyone. So, energy dominance is about us…having affordable energy to power all Americans.” Having “low-cost, affordable reliable energy,” he continued “drives everything home…because it keeps inflation down for every single production. There isn’t a product you wear, there isn’t a product that you eat, there isn’t a product that you drive, there isn’t a home that you live in that doesn’t have an energy component already in it.”

President Donald Trump upon taking office issued an executive order prioritizing mineral mining on federal lands and opening the door to rescinding existing bans.
While WGA emphasizes the bipartisan nature of its organization, Burgum alluded to outside tensions, arguing that “part of the divisiveness in our country is getting people to believe that everything is scarce, and if we do A, then we can’t do B, or if we do B, we can’t do A. We just have to get an abundance mindset, and we have to understand that innovation will solve any problem that we have.”
Specifically, he homed in on artificial intelligence, which he said is “going to change every job, every company and every industry. It would be impossible for me to overhype this in any possible way.”
Technological advances “extends human capability” such that “we’re at this tipping point where we now have the ability to actually solve all of our problems and stop living in a world where everything is a trade-off.”
But this vision can only come to pass if America has enough energy, Burgum said, and at present “our grid is at great risk.” Rolling blackouts and rolling brownouts during peak summer and peak winter are possible, he said, not because of climate change or the environment, but because you “can’t run a grid if the majority of your energy source is intermittent.” For instance: “The sun goes down at night,” thus, “there’s no solar production at night in this country.”
On the other hand, he said, in about 10 years, “the advancements coming in nuclear will produce clean energy in unlimited forms.” Burgum noted four executive orders Trump signed in May aimed at expediting approval of nuclear reactors, among other goals.
Hence, he said “the existential threat that we are facing is not one or two degrees of climate change in 2100, because we’ll solve all that… in the next decade or two by the innovation that will be provided if we can cut the red tape and have enough energy to drive AI and have enough energy to sell to our friends and allies, so they can stop buying from our adversaries.”
Outgoing WGA Chair New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham recently announced a $1 billion geothermal plant in the state and attended an energy summit in Alaska. In her question to Burgum about the role western states can play, she noted that New Mexico “continues to have huge opportunities for energy production, everything from fossil fuels to small-scale nuclear.” Western governors want to “help demonstrate” the ability to deploy “effective clean energy across the spectrum.”
Burgum noted that the strategy in New Mexico and other Western states is one of “energy abundance” and an “understanding it’s not an energy transition.”
New Mexico does, in fact, have an Energy Transition Act that sets zero-carbon goals for the coming decades.
“There is no transition,” Burgum continued. “It’s energy addition. We need everything we have, and then we need a lot more of it.”

Matthew Reeves, a partner with the firm, said in court last month he had used artificial intelligence to obtain citations in documents filed on behalf of the Alabama Department of Corrections in a lawsuit from an inmate alleging the department failed to protect him from violence.
Attorneys for the inmate first flagged the citations. U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, overseeing the case, described five of them as “hallucinations,” including at least two to cases that do not exist.
Representatives from Butler Snow told Manasco during the May hearing that the firm would review filings from other cases to investigate any other possible use of AI that led to fabricated citations in other documents.
Manasco agreed to the firm’s request at the hearing to allow Butler Snow to complete the internal investigation before she levies sanctions in the case.
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, based in Philadelphia,  independently reviewed the filings. The firm also included declarations from the attorneys in the case that they have not used AI in this case or any other aside from Reeves.
“The firm has begun the process of implementing the revised policies and procedures previously described to the Court,” Butler Snow said in the filing. “In addition, Matthew B. Reeves is, in conjunction with Plaintiff’s counsel and law school professor Anil Mujumdar, engaging in efforts to educate law students regarding the risks and repercussions of the use of AI in legal practice to help deter such conduct by others.”
The case is a civil lawsuit filed by Frankie Johnson against the Alabama Department of Corrections after he was assaulted by 13 people and stabbed at least nine times at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer in December 2019.
Johnson alleges corrections staff failed to protect him which led to another assault in March 2020 when he was stabbed by another individual at Donaldson.
During the case, attorneys for the Alabama Department of Corrections filed a motion to depose Johnson the week of June 3, but his attorneys filed their own motion seeking to delay the deposition to better prepare their client for questioning.
Reeves then filed a response to that motion to challenge opposing counsel’s request, claiming that courts have required people to testify after they are given proper notice, which they argued happened in the case. The filing included two legal references that attorneys for Johnson said they could not verify. Reeves admitted to using AI to generate the citations to support his argument without verifying if they were accurate.

(Photo by Austin Fisher/Source NM)As state-level elected officials met with cabinet secretaries appointed by Donald Trump at the Western Governors Association’s annual meeting on Monday afternoon, hundreds of demonstrators protested outside, their chants of “not for sale” echoing through downtown Santa Fe.
A coalition of hunters, fishers, mountain bikers, rock climbers, skiers, hikers, campers, wildlife lovers and more marched to the conference venue from nearby DeVargas Park, where the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance hosted a rally to oppose a Republican tax and spend proposal that would make more than 21,000 square miles of public land in New Mexico “eligible” to be sold to private buyers, according to a recent analysis.
New Mexico State Police unsuccessfully tried to stop the crowd from completely blocking West San Francisco Street and the entrance to El Dorado Hotel, where U.S. cabinet secretaries and state and territorial governors were gathered. Earlier in the day, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had given a keynote address to conference attendees, with no mention of the GOP proposal.
“This land is sacred, this land belongs to all of us, the water belongs to all of us,” Santa Clara Pueblo Gov. James Naranjo said at the rally. “They don’t belong to rich millionaires, they belong to the people of New Mexico and our visitors that come a long way to see our beautiful state, our beautiful culture, our beautiful ways of life.”
Speakers at the rally also opposed the Trump administration’s review of national monument protections, including buffer zones around Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
“Please support us tribes,” Naranjo told the crowd. “We’re fighting for Chaco Canyon, we’re fighting for Bears Ears, Tent Rocks, Puye Cliffs, Bandelier, Valles Caldera. All our national parks are in jeopardy.”

Teresa Martinez, executive director and co-founder of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition, said when people stand up for the land, they also stand up for each other. She said 100 years from now, future generations need to know that the right people stood up at the right time to protect cherished natural landscapes.
“Because if we don’t do it, the wrong people will,” she said, gesturing to the hotel where the governors were meeting with Trump officials. “The people in that room are the wrong people, and they’re trying to do it right now.”
Lauren Leib, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 340, which represents federal Bureau of Land Management workers in New Mexico, called on all of the state and federal officials at the conference to stop the tax and spending legislation going through Congress called the “one big beautiful bill.”
“They’re using this rationale to propose selling off millions of acres of our public lands to offset the massive tax breaks for the 1%, and they’re doing that under the guise of creating affordable housing,” Leib said. “That’s now how you solve the housing crisis.”
Instead, she said, policymakers should enact rent control, living wages and regulations of the rich who can afford to buy up housing.
“They’re trying to steal your public lands to line their own pockets out of insatiable greed, and utter disdain for working class people like you and me,” she said.
Also during the rally, more than 100 nonprofit organizations delivered a letter to the 19 state leaders at the WGA conference, urging them to oppose the federal legislation. The letter warned that the proposal would allow an unprecedented disposal of public lands “with no environmental review, meaningful Tribal consultation, or public input.”
“It will take effect with lightning speed, forcing the immediate nomination of lands put up for auction within 30 days, all with no public process,” the letter states. “There are no requirements or safeguards that sold land be used for affordable housing. It’s an attack on the very values Westerners hold dear.”
Naranjo placed the struggle over public lands in the context of his people’s struggles against colonialism.
“We fought off the Spaniards. We fought off the U.S. government,” he said. “We fought off a lot of people in our day, my ancestors, and we’re still here.”

The state plans to double subsidies to films, which amount to half that.","When James Marshall discovered traces of gold in the American River in 1848, he ignited the famous California Gold Rush that attracted a tidal wave of immigration and led to statehood just two years later.
However, not everyone who made the arduous trek to California in the mid-19th century was seeking gold. Many — including those in the ill-fated 1846 Donner Party — wanted farmland.
Completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 made immigration into California and shipping produce out of the state much easier. As the gold rush quickly waned, agriculture became the state’s dominant industry, globally famous for fresh fruits and vegetables.
California’s vast network of reservoirs to capture water and canals to deliver it was originally created to help farmers prosper. They still use, by a wide margin, most of the system’s water.
While California is still No.1 in agricultural production among the states, generating about $60 billion a year, other sectors, such as technology, health care and logistics now play much larger roles in the state’s economy.
This is the time of year when crops are maturing and farmers are looking forward to harvests, shipments and paydays. But agricultural leaders see this year as one of the industry’s most trying periods, beset by economic and political factors that could significantly reduce production.
“When we talk about the things that are keeping me up at night, it really comes down to what is going to keep our members in business,” Shannon Douglass, president of the California Farm Bureau, said this month during a gathering of industry leaders.
She cited a federal census of agriculture which revealed California has lost 20% of its farmers in the last decade.  The industry is at a tipping point, she declared.
She also pointed to a study by researchers at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo that detailed rising costs of producing lettuce in the Salinas Valley due to government regulations. It found that costs of environmental, labor and food safety regulation are $1,600 per acre, up 63.7% since 2017, while income from lettuce has been virtually stagnant.
The list of factors affecting the industry also includes rising labor costs due to state wage regulations, new limits on pumping water from wells and demands from the state to reduce water diversions from rivers.
This year brought two new adverse factors — President Donald Trump’s tariffs that could generate retaliatory tariffs, depressing export markets, and Trump’s sweeps of undocumented immigrants, who are a major portion of the agricultural labor force.
Alexi Rodriguez, president of the Almond Alliance, told the gathering that China had been the top market for almonds until 2018, when an earlier round of Trump’s tariffs cut shipments. “After this year, China is likely to drop out of the top 10 export markets for almonds as a result,” she said.
The state’s labor costs also put California’s growers at a disadvantage.
“We’re sitting here in California and getting our brains beat in with costs that are through the roof and going up against my competitors in the East Coast paying $8 to $9 an hour for labor, and we’re dealing with the same customers,” said Mike Way, a bell pepper producer in the Coachella Valley. “What’s my choice? My choice is to shrink my acreage and go elsewhere.”
As agriculture’s acreage declined, so too did its economic importance and its once-dominant political clout vis-à-vis other economic interests. Efforts by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders to double state subsidies for the film industry underscore that decline.
Newsom, et al, says the subsidies are necessary to keep film production from declining further. The film industry pegs its economic contribution at $30 billion a year, just half of agriculture’s output.

Where is the district located?
The north central Senate district includes Lamar, Fayette, Walker, the northern half of Tuscaloosa County and the western part of Jefferson County.
How did the seat become vacant?
Former Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Reed, R-Jasper, who had held the seat since 2010, stepped down at the beginning of the year to join Gov. Kay Ivey’s administration as Senior Advisor to Workforce Transformation. Reed’s role is transitioning the Department of Labor into the new Department of Workforce, with an aim at boosting Alabama’s labor force participation. Reed, who had led the Senate since 2021, was strongly allied with business interests and helped expand tax incentives and workforce training programs during his time in the Senate.
Does the seat have a partisan lean?
The seat is strongly Republican. Reed first won the seat in 2010 as a first-time candidate with 73.3% of the votes. Reed subsequently ran unopposed in the Republican primaries and was not challenged by a Democratic candidate in 2014, 2018 and 2022, according to Ballotpedia.
What issues dominate the race?
Woods is campaigning on his legislative record and a platform of conservative leadership. He pointed to the “Alabama Child Protection Act,” a bill he sponsored that criminalized the creation, sharing or possession of child sexual abuse material, and his work on the “Parents’ Right to Know Act,” requiring schools to post classroom curricula online. Woods also pointed to his votes in favor of grocery tax cuts and the elimination of sales tax on feminine and baby products, saying that he is committed to cutting taxes. If elected, he intends to re-introduce legislation to increase penalties for violent threats to schools and to remove state sales tax on federally funded broadband equipment so that more grant money goes to infrastructure development.
Cagle is a first-time candidate advocating for the proper representation of working-class and vulnerable populations. He said he was concerned that current elected officials are not sufficiently engaged with on-the-ground issues like poverty and the opioid crisis. He criticized the influence of lobbyists and large corporations on state leadership and called for a reprioritization of state policies to better support communities. He also criticized the “CHOOSE Act” for expanding funding for private schools and homeschooling at the expense of public education.
What happens after today?
The candidate with the most votes will be elected to represent the district.
Will the results alter control of the Legislature?
No. Republicans currently hold 73 of the 105 seats in the lower chamber and 26 of the 35 seats in the upper chamber.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SD5-race-1024x683.png,,,2025-06-24 09:06:35.408138

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator) State policy calls for government agencies to log all moveable property that cost more than $1,000 within 60 days of its acquisition, but a recent review found Louisiana State Police has failed to keep an accurate inventory of such purchases for the past six years.
The Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s review of the state Department of Public Safety, which was made public Monday, found that three major purchases were left off the books during the review period – a narcotics-detecting dog and two helicopters – with a total listed value of more than $9.43 million. 
The audit sampled 35 State Police movable property purchases between Sept. 29, 2023, and June 30, 2024. It found 10 items – including the helicopters and the drug-sniffing canine – were not logged into the state property system within 60 days. Of those 10, two were entered only after the auditor notified State Police.
The time it took for the assets to be logged as required ranged from 167 to 389 days.
In its response to the audit’s findings, Louisiana State Police said it would work with the Louisiana Property Assistance Agency to create movable property training tailored to its needs. More than 25,000 pieces of movable property are under State Police control, Maj. Nicole Kilgore, Support Services command inspector, said in response to the audit.
The Department of Public Safety review also discovered the Office of State Fire Marshall failed to timely certify and approve all time sheets – a finding the auditor has noted for three years running.
Between Oct. 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024, the audit counted 558 out of 5,195 timesheets that were not certified by employees. Also, 999 timesheets – totaling $3.3 million in salaries, wages, leave and overtime pay – weren’t approved by a supervisor before they were submitted for payroll processing.
State Fire Marshal Ed Branch concurred with the auditor’s findings. He said his office has added timekeepers to assist employees and supervisors with adhering to state policy. Those who do not comply will be tracked and notified. 
“For repeat offenders, disciplinary action will be taken,” Branch wrote in response to the audit.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Louisiana-State-Police-relief-1024x754.jpg,,,2025-06-24 08:01:44.717732

The Public Utilities Commission of Nevada voted Monday to approve the utility’s request for a significant decrease in its deferred energy rate, an accounting method used by the utility to adjust for changes in the price of natural gas.  
The change will go into effect on July 1 and is expected to lower the average gas bill in Southern Nevada by more than $10 a month, and by more than $18 a month in Northern Nevada, according to PUC Hearing Officer Sam Crano.
The commission also approved a request from staff to investigate how NV Energy overcharged as many as 80,000 customers during the last two decades.
NV Energy, which services most of the state, overcharged some 60,000 customers by more than $17 million, disconnected service to some, and attempted to rectify the mistake by offering six months’ worth of refunds that amount to a fraction of what customers overpaid. The company informed regulators in late April that it overcharged another 20,000 customers an undisclosed amount.
“They won’t tell me how long I’ve been overcharged and how they came up with the $47 credit to my account,” Las Vegas resident Irwin Silver said during public comment. “I call up NV Energy and you give me the run around. They hang up on me.”
Chair Hailey Williamson announced the PUC’s general counsel recommended the commission grant staff’s request for an investigation.
“The scope of the investigation should include a focus on identifying the full extent of misclassifications of customers and how such misclassifications occurred, whether NV Energy misapplied its tariffs and appropriate remedies to avoid future misclassifications and compensate overcharged customers,” Williamson said. “I think this is incredibly important.”
PUC staff, through an investigation, “discovered that NV Energy has been overcharging tens of thousands of misclassified residential customers since as early as 2001,” according to the staff’s petition.
NV Energy, which says it completed an audit of the misclassifications in January, disclosed in late April that it overcharged some 20,000 “previously unidentified ‘multi-family accounts’ for an undisclosed amount.”
“Despite overcharging more than 80,000 customers for up to 23 years, NV Energy only provided refunds to a portion of affected customers. For the customers who received them, NV Energy capped refunds at six months, amounting to less than $2 million in refunds,” PUC staff asserted, adding the rule capping reimbursement to six months may not apply to customers in the north, and does not apply to customers in the south.
The skimpiness of the refunds triggered public outcry and caught the attention of the Nevada State Legislature, which approved Assembly Bill 452, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Tracy Brown-May. The law requires that customers receive full refunds with interest for overcharges, address high utility bills by shifting some cost volatility back to utilities, and extend regulatory timelines for rate case reviews.
The PUC, however, already has the authority to order NV Energy to fully refund customers for the overcharge.
It’s unknown how the misclassification occurred, according to the petition, but it began in 2001 when the utility adopted its multi-family rate schedule. 
Between 2017 and 2024, NV Energy overcharged some 59,939 customers across 22,101 premises just over $17 million because it misclassified the multifamily residences as single-family. 
During the same period, NV Energy undercharged 5,438 customers across 2,451 premises for just over $2.5 million because it misclassified single-family residences as multi-family.
The utility released a public statement saying it “promptly refunded the overcharged customers in accordance with the applicable rules and is not seeking repayment by those customers who were undercharged.” 
NV Energy did not publicly disclose that the amount undercharged was a fraction (12.4%) of the amount overcharged, according to PUC staff. 
“In addition to financial harm, NV Energy disconnected service for a substantial number of injured customers due to nonpayment. Between April 1, 2017 and April 1, 2024, NV Energy disconnected service to 3,177 of the 59,939 customers who overpaid,” staff wrote in its petition.
Staff writes that given the number of affected customers disconnected for nonpayment, “it is reasonable to infer that overbilling contributed to, if not caused, nonpayment and related service disconnections in some cases.” 
Staff contends NV Energy used an inapplicable rule to cap refunds at six months, “denying tens of thousands of known injured customers millions of dollars of measurable financial losses…” 
The utility did not notify PUC staff of the mistake, but instead unilaterally applied the six-month rule. 
The PUC can issue administrative fines against NV Energy, require the utility to make customers whole, and impose any other remedy available. 
Staff is recommending the Commission order NV Energy to fully refund affected customers as a sanction.
“NV Energy is committed to working with our regulators through a transparent process that provides a fair and balanced outcome for the impacted customers and will continue working with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada through the recently opened investigatory docket,” the utility’s spokesperson Meghin Delaney said in a statement Monday. “We continue to review customer accounts to correct any remaining miscoded properties and to implement controls and process improvements to help avoid this type of error in the future.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/natural-gas-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 08:01:44.717732

Critics say it would criminalize legitimate criticism of Israel.,"Assemblyman Gary Schaer, a bill sponsor, said he is disappointed a vote on it was postponed yet again. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Trenton lawmakers heard nearly three more hours of debate Monday on a controversial bill that would establish a specific definition of antisemitism in state law, but they did not take a vote on the measure.
Assemblyman Gary Schaer (D-Passaic), the bill’s chief sponsor, said he was surprised by the decision not to move forward with a vote. Schaer introduced the bill in February 2024 and has previously expressed frustration that it has not yet been voted on by the Assembly’s community development committee.
“The bill before you is well over a year old. Within that period of time, it seems to me that there has been ample time for members to debate the merits as well as the disadvantages of this bill or any other bill,” Schaer said.
Those who testified echoed similar sentiments.
The bill, which has more than 50 cosponsors, would require that the state recognize the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism to aid investigators trying to determine if a crime has been motivated by antisemitic bias. Its Senate companion cleared a committee in that chamber one year ago after nine hours of testimony.
Critics say the bill improperly conflates criticism of Israel with antisemitism and would criminalize protests against Israel. Basma Bsharat is the education director at the Palestinian American Community Center in Clifton.
“Do not criminalize our story,” Bsharat said during a committee hearing Monday.
The committee also heard from Sadaf Jaffar, a former New Jersey assemblywoman and mayor.
“All good and decent people stand against hate, including antisemitism. This is not what this legislation is about,” Jaffar said. “We do not have a definition of antiblack racism or antiimmigrant hate. This does not stop hate crimes from being prosecuted, as they should be.”
Supporters of the bill argued that members of the Jewish community live in fear of attacks because of their religion, and said this legislation would serve as protection against that violence. 
“We are at a moment where Jewish families are scared to send our kids to school, attend synagogue, or simply live our daily lives without fear of hate and violence,” Katie Katz, the executive director at Teach NJ, said to the committee.
In an April report, the Anti-Defamation League said there were 719 total reported antisemitic incidents in New Jersey in 2024. Though that represents a 13% dip from 2023, the Anti-Defamation League said it was the third-highest number recorded in any state nationwide last year and the second-highest ever recorded in New Jersey.
Jason Shames is the CEO and executive vice president of the Jewish Federation of Northern New Jersey.
“You know exactly what is going on in our community with Jews being harassed on the street all over the place just for being Jewish, not just for support of Israel,” Shames told lawmakers Monday.

It takes just one boat carrying an invasive to add another pristine lake to the list of infested water bodies.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Pat Suozzi: Big waves, aquatic invasives and Vermont’s home lake rule.","This commentary is by Pat Suozzi of Hinesburg, president of the Federation of Vermont Lakes and Ponds.


Picture this: a motorboat puts into Lake Champlain. As you watch it move out towards the middle of the lake, you notice something odd happens: its stern is down, and its bow is up. 
As it moves slowly along, you realize that it is producing very large waves and that rather than a water skier, there is a person on a small board apparently surfing on the boat’s large wake. What you are observing is a wake boat in wake sports mode.
The mechanism that allows wake boats to create these waves are ballast tanks that are filled with lake water when a boat enters a lake. Once the boater is ready to leave the lake, those ballast tanks are emptied. However, there is a problem. 
Those ballast tanks — and wake boats usually have multiple tanks — cannot be fully emptied, always leaving some residual water. If that boat filled its tanks in a lake infested with an aquatic invasive species that boat could potentially carry those invasives to the next lake the boat enters.  
The definition of an aquatic invasive species is that it has no natural predators, proliferates quickly, damages ecosystems and provides no nutrition or support for native fish or wildlife. Even very small fragments of an invasive like Eurasian watermilfoil or a few zebra mussel larvae, if carried into a lake in a ballast tank, can spawn a serious infestation.
However, this does not have to happen. Vermont has a rule to prevent this very scenario.
In the spring of 2024, the state approved new rules to regulate wake boats including the home lake provision specifically intended to prevent wake boats from carrying aquatic invasive species from lake to lake. The home lake provision requires that all wake boats select one home lake where it will operate. If a wake boat owner wishes to operate in a different lake, they must show proof that the wake boat has been properly decontaminated.
Unfortunately, the Agency of Natural Resources chose not to implement this provision of the rule last year due to lack of time.
Yet here we are in June of 2025, and the agency has once again announced that it will not implement the home lake provision despite many of the lake associations on affected lakes repeatedly offering to work with the agency to shoulder much of the burden of implementation.
Why so much concern? After all, as far as we know, wake boats comprise a very small number of boats on the state’s lakes, although they are growing in popularity.
The reason is that an invasive infestation can harm a lake’s ecosystem, damage fisheries, make recreational use unpleasant or impossible and can cause economic harm to surrounding communities.
We are amazingly fortunate here in Vermont to have so many still pristine and uninfested lakes. Yet the Agency of Natural Resources, the agency specifically charged by law to protect Vermont’s lakes and to stop the spread of aquatic invasives, has again chosen to put the state’s precious water resources at risk. It takes just one boat carrying an invasive to add another pristine lake to the list of infested water bodies.
With the boating season already well underway, what can be done?
If you love Vermont lakes you can help to stop the spread by making sure that all your aquatic gear: boats, kayaks, canoes, paddleboards, and even life jackets and children’s toys, are cleaned, drained and dried whenever they leave a waterbody and before they enter another.
If you go to a lake with Greeters, stop and talk with them. The Greeters, managed by volunteer lake associations, are trained to inspect and clean aquatic gear and can also provide information about whether a lake is infested with an invasive and, if so, the best ways to avoid spreading it.
Finally, a few special requests to wake boat owners: please consider keeping your boat on just one lake this summer, especially if you have used your boat in wake sport mode in an infested lake. If that is not possible, please drain your ballast tanks as fully as you can and keep your boat out of the water for at least 14 days to allow any invasives to die. Also, keep in mind that wake boats’ enhanced wakes can cause shoreline erosion issues, and can be dangerous to other lake users — so please perform all wake sports in the lake’s designated wake sport zone.
Our lakes are the jewels of Vermont. All of us working together can protect these very special resources.

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Washington state inspectors are way behind in their examinations of hospitals and fail to investigate when hospitals report errors they made in caring for patients.
That’s the word from a preliminary report recently published by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee.
Nearly three-quarters of acute care hospital inspections were late, as of December, according to the committee. One facility hadn’t gotten a state inspection since early 2018.
What this lag means for health outcomes is unknown, the report says. 
The check-ups involve registered nurses who focus on patient care and other inspectors who look at everything from staff training to cleanliness.
The audit also found delays in inspecting behavioral health hospitals, a backlog in uninvestigated complaints about hospitals and that state hospital data could be more accessible online. Many of the issues are driven by a lack of staff.
Before the pandemic, the state inspected 81% of acute care hospitals on time, but that dropped to 28% by the end of 2024, according to a committee analysis of state Department of Health data.
The health department has to inspect each acute care hospital “on average, at least every 18 months,” under state law. From May 2021 through 2024, the state was averaging 31 inspections per year, down from 41 per year before the pandemic, according to the report. Washington had 93 acute care hospitals at the beginning of this year.
In one example of the inspections, committee staff accompanied six inspectors as they made an unannounced three-day visit at a 400-bed hospital. They evaluated dialysis and colonoscopy processes, sterilization of equipment and drug administration.
The Washington State Hospital Association noted other state agencies, including the Department of Labor and Industries and the Health Care Authority, also provide hospital oversight. 
“Hospitals are inspected frequently enough that they often must request state agencies coordinate so they are not on site at the same time,” spokesperson Tim Pfarr said.
Hospitals are allowed to count federally required outside inspections once every three years in lieu of a state check-in. But the state hasn’t verified that these accredited non-state inspectors follow similar standards to Washington’s requirements, the report found. 
And when hospitals get these outside inspections, they must prove they passed, but the state says most hospitals don’t provide that evidence and it doesn’t keep track of which hospitals do, the audit found. Without these reports, inspectors may be unaware of more recent problems.
The Department of Health attributes the holdup to an overworked staff and increasing inspection needs as hospitals expand their services. Inspectors also examine other medical facilities separate from hospitals. The agency expects to reach the 18-month timeline for most hospitals by 2028 or 2029.
State law also requires the agency to inspect each behavioral health hospital every year, but it hasn’t met that goal since 2018. Inspectors have made progress since the pandemic. Last year, they evaluated eight of 10 such hospitals.
The audit committee suggests the Legislature fine-tune the law on hospital inspection frequency. For example, the statute doesn’t specify the maximum amount of time that can pass between inspections.
The Department of Health declined to comment on the findings as the report is not yet finalized.
The final report will likely be published in July. State lawmakers ordered the audit in 2022.
Complaints and errors
The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee also examined how the state handles complaints against hospitals. Grievances range from patient neglect and injuries to medication errors and other mistakes. 
As these complaints have increased over the past decade, the department completed reviews of 80% of complaints within its goal of 170 days, according to the report, but also faces a backlog of more minor allegations to probe. A lack of complaints reported in languages other than English may also signal access barriers.
Washington’s 103 acute care and behavioral health hospitals pay for their own state oversight through annual licensing fees. The Department of Health hiked these fees last year to help staff up the unit investigating complaints against hospitals. 
When fully staffed, the department has 10 staff each inspecting medical facilities and looking into complaints. But the inspections unit has only been fully staffed one of the past eight years.
Washington has also seen hospital reports of their own avoidable medical errors jump dramatically in recent years. These errors, known as “adverse health events,” include issues like bed sores and mistakes with medication.
The Department of Health is supposed to investigate these reports and review hospitals’ plans for preventing similar problems in the future. But the agency doesn’t do that, undercutting an opportunity to identify common problems at hospitals and take steps to prevent them, the report found.

The House of Representatives took the two most vital votes of the year without record.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lachlan Francis: It’s time for electronic voting and transparency in the Legislature.","This commentary is by Lachlan Francis of Westminster. He is chair of the Windham County Democratic Committee and a member of the Vermont State Democratic Committee.


This legislative session made one thing very clear: it is time for electronic voting in Montpelier. While this is nothing new, our esteemed legislators are far too comfortable casting votes that will never be recorded, denying their constituents the opportunity to be fully informed about how they are represented. 
Take, for example, a few of the most high profile issues of this past legislative session. In January, we know from reporting that 18 Vermont legislators voted to overturn the 2024 election for Lieutenant Governor, yet the identity of those 18 is forever concealed because it was done via secret ballot.
That vote came just months after many Democratic and Progressive legislators were telling their constituents that “Democracy is on the line” in the 2024 elections — and yet, roughly one in five of them voted to overturn the election as a first order of business in 2025, despite a margin of six thousand votes, nearly 2% of the statewide electorate. We will never know who these 18 election deniers were.
More recently, after having spent months debating the education transformation bill — the singular policy debate of the year — the House of Representatives took the two most vital votes of the year without record.
First, to suspend the rules so that they could consider a conference committee bill that overstepped the procedural boundaries of such a bill, they held a “vote by division” — meaning supporters stood and were counted, then sat, and then opponents stood and were counted. None of which, of course, was written down.
Within seconds, a voice vote on the entire package was called, and it was deemed that the “ayes” had it, sealing the bill’s fate without a single recorded vote in the House. This prompted outcry from some members, and ultimately a roll call vote was held on the procedural issue of whether to send the bill to the governor for his signature. 
Legislators who are embarrassed by that lack of transparency have already attempted to claim that the procedural roll call vote should be deemed the vote of record — it’s better than nothing, but it’s a certainty that some legislators voted one way on the rules suspension and adoption votes, then another on the procedural vote. For example, there were 113 “aye” votes to suspend the rules, but only 96 “aye” votes on the procedural motion.
What’s worse is that, in both of the instances above, multiple legislators have told me and others that it happened because they were not sure what they were voting on at the time that they voted. That is even more concerning, and more reason for an electronic voting system that would make the process faster and more transparent for legislators and citizens alike. 
Nearly every other state utilizes electronic voting in their legislative assemblies, and Vermont has a bipartisan bill — introduced by Democrat Mike Mrowicki, D-Putney, and Republican Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden — that would mandate such a system in the Vermont House. Both chambers in Montpelier should adopt such a system before they further embarrass themselves.

Anthony D’Amato and his cousin, Angelo Buono, were convicted of strangling five people to death in southern California. D’Amato, who was suspected of several other murders but never convicted, killed two more women by himself in the Bellingham area. D’Amato, now 74, changed his name from Kenneth Bianchi in 2023.
Washington’s Indeterminate Sentence Review Board will consider parole for D’Amato on Wednesday. He’s currently held at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla.
The hearing was previously scheduled for late May, but postponed. As is standard, it will be closed to the general public. The result of the hearing will be posted online by July 23, according to the board.
After raping and killing women in the Los Angeles area, D’Amato was working as a security guard in Bellingham in January 1979. While there, he lured two Western Washington University students, Karen Mandic and Diane Wilder, into a home and strangled them to death. Their murders led police to connect D’Amato to around 10 similar cases in California.
D’Amato pleaded guilty to the killings in Washington state court to escape the death penalty. He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.

In 1990, the review board revised his life imprisonment to a sentence of more than 118 years due to a change in state law. With credit for good behavior, his release is set for 2065, when he would be 114 years old, according to the state Department of Corrections.
If the board decides against parole, more time could be added to his sentence.
In his decades incarcerated, D’Amato has challenged his Washington convictions on numerous grounds, including by claiming his confession was the product of hypnosis. He’s repeatedly maintained he’s innocent.
The board has denied D’Amato’s parole requests multiple times in recent years.
If ever released from Washington custody, D’Amato would serve separate life sentences in California. He is also set for a parole hearing in California next month for the five murder charges to which he pleaded guilty there, where he has previously been denied relief.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
Following the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly nine in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than four in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training, and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is now law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

But counties have struggled to foot the bill themselves in lower-level cases.,"(Getty Images)Beginning next month — and for the first time in nearly 30 years — nine Indiana counties will enjoy partial state reimbursement for spending on public defenders for destitute Hoosiers accused of misdemeanors.
The U.S. and Indiana constitutions afford those facing criminal charges the right to public defense when they can’t afford it themselves.
Counties can draw on the Indiana Commission on Court Appointed Attorneys to help pay for public defense in death penalty, felony and child abuse cases — but they’re on their own for misdemeanors.
That’s changing via a limited pilot program.
Its backers hope to build a case for long-term reimbursement.
  Derrick Mason (Courtesy Commission on Court Appointed Attorneys)
The commission’s “top priority” is to guarantee enough funding “for our core mission of reimbursing all counties that comply with our standards for the entire 40% of their eligible public defense expenses,” Executive Director Derrick Mason said in a news release.
“We intend to achieve that mission by continuing to ensure constitutionally protected, effective public defense services are provided,” he continued. Commission data has shown that doing so “ultimately saves taxpayer dollars at both the state and county level.”
Program takes shape
Clark, DeKalb, Floyd, Lawrence, Perry, Pulaski, Steuben, Vigo, and Wabash counties will be eligible for 18 months of 40% reimbursement as part of an initiative authorized last year.
That’s in exchange for agreeing to abide by attorney caseload and compensation standards set by the commission. They must also send data on how the reimbursement has impacted attorney appointment rates, jail population, trial rates, and case outcomes for a report due by 2029.
“The overall goal of the pilot is to gather data to determine whether (commission) reimbursement to counties, in exchange for the county following standards in the representation of people charged with misdemeanors, produces improved outcomes in Indiana’s criminal justice system,” the news release explained.
The nine selections were finalized at a meeting last Wednesday.
Senate Enrolled Act 179, enacted in 2024, required the commission to consider population and geographic diversity.
Staff also prioritized counties with track records of strong leadership, effective communication and accurate, on-time reimbursement requests, according to meeting materials.
Indiana to pilot return to misdemeanor defense reimbursement

One table featured red-to-green color-coding for the 21 applicants based on how highly they were recommended for the pilot. Clark County was lauded as a “unique opportunity,” for example, while several unsuccessful counties were knocked for data errors and noncompliance.
It’s a smaller pilot than authorized.
The statute lets the commission pick up to 12 participants for a four-year pilot. But the agency chose nine, and it’ll last for less than half the time.
The news release cited “budget cuts.” Most agencies were dealt a 5% cut after a grim revenue forecast forced budget architects to scale back spending — and they’ve been directed to withhold an additional 5%.
But participation could be renewed after the initial 18-month term, based on each county’s success and upon the commission’s budget, per the news release. Meeting materials noted that if some participants can’t follow through, the commission could replace them or just let the pilot shrink.
The pilot could also grow if there’s enough money.
Last year, when it was setting up the pilot, the commission envisioned funding it with a pandemic-era surplus and recently doubled fees paid by some Hoosiers assigned public defense.

'How do you teach biology? How do you teach sociology or literature? Are William Faulkner's books banned?'","A federal judge will hear arguments Tuesday over enforcement of a new law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs from Mississippi public schools and universities.
A coalition of civil rights and legal organizations, on behalf of students, parents and educators, is asking U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing state officials from enforcing the mandate. American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi and partner legal groups filed the lawsuit on June 9 against the state’s education boards. 
House Bill 1193, which was passed after heated debate during the 2025 legislative session, prevents public schools from creating diversity, equity and inclusion offices, engaging in “divisive” concepts and hiring people based on their race, sex, color or national origin. It also enshrines in law the teaching that there are two genders — male and female.
The hearing comes after the state Board of Education and the Institutions of Higher Learning, to comply with the law, voted last week to approve policies that create a complaint and investigation process for violations. Now local school boards will have to come up with their own policies that comply with the new law.
Rob McDuff, a Mississippi Center for Justice attorney on the case, said a temporary pause would benefit both parties in the lawsuit. 
“This is going to be a real pain to enforce,” he said. “We’re asking the judge to put a pause on it until we can dive into the legal issues and resolve them. I think that would be in everybody’s interest.”
McDuff said he’s concerned that the policy adopted by the state education board is going to lead to a wave of complaints, and there are still a number of issues with the law itself. For example, the civil rights attorney said, there’s no explanation of how to cure a violation in the bill, which could lead to different interpretations. And the consequences are dire — state money will be withheld from any school with two violations or more until those schools return to compliance.
While other states have adopted similar laws as part of a national anti-DEI trend, McDuff said Mississippi’s law restricts the normal classroom teacher far more than other laws he’s reviewed. 
“This opens the door to ideological warfare on campuses,” he said. “How do you teach biology? How do you teach sociology or literature? Are William Faulkner’s books banned?”
Professors and school officials, including Laura Mammina, a history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi, provided written comments to education officials opposing the bill.
“As it currently stands, the policy, like the law, is a gross violation of the United States Constitution,” she wrote. “This issue will impact the quality of education in our state, and have effects on current students that may last for decades to come.” 
Jackson Public Schools’ deputy superintendent Michael Cormack Jr. asked a number of questions of the state education department’s chief of advocacy and counsel, Erin Meyer, in his public comment about the new policy, including whether or not the district could still celebrate Black History Month and if one of the district’s core values, “equity,” put them out of compliance. 
He also asked whether teaching about the causes of the Civil War is no longer allowed under HB 1193 and if the district’s effort to hire more male teachers was prohibited by the new law.
State Rep. Kabir Karriem, who leads the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, said the bill is a step backwards. His organization also submitted a comment opposing the policy.
“It’s a bad piece of legislation,” he said. “It’s unfortunate that our kids have to suffer.”

When recognizing the rights of people as citizens, we have a lot of examples. At the inception of our distinguished nation, the preamble of the U.S. Constitution was established: “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the General Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”
Missouri became the 24th state in 1821. Our state motto, carved in Latin into the ceiling of the state capital rotunda, reads: “Salus Populi Suprema lex Esto,” which means “The Welfare of the People Shall be the Supreme Law.”
This principle shows Missouri’s commitment to its citizens’ well-being. It reflects the values in the Constitution and should guide our elected representatives in Jefferson City. However, a state representative told me, “You only have as many rights as you have money and political power.”
The influence of money is clear in how Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) are regulated and how they manage the large amounts of waste they produce.
In the early 2000s, rural citizens and family farmers negatively affected by CAFO pollution sued and won. But in 2011, the Missouri legislature changed the law to prevent people from suing over the loss of enjoyment of their property due to CAFOs. This change shows how money and power can overshadow the rights and well-being of Missouri citizens. The principles in Missouri’s motto and the state and U.S. Constitutions are ignored when economic power dictates our rights.
For CAFOs, the environmental and health impacts on nearby residents are often ignored. Corporate interests override the voices of communities, leaving them to deal with pollution and a declining quality of life. Legal victories once provided hope, but later changes in laws remind us how fragile justice is against powerful special interests.
In 2013, the corporate takeover of rural communities began with allowing foreign corporations to own 1% of Missouri farmland — which was at the time 289,000 acres. Shuanghui International, now WH Group, quickly bought Smithfield Foods, amassing over 40,000 acres of Missouri farmland.
In 2014, the “Right to Farm” constitutional amendment was introduced. Its deceptive language seemed to give CAFOs and foreign corporations free reign.
Then, in 2019, the Missouri legislature passed a bill outlawing “local control” over CAFOs. This bill stripped counties of their ability to protect citizens through local health ordinances. These rules limited CAFO setbacks from water sources, homes, schools, and churches. Counties could not enforce any protections stronger than Missouri’s weak regulations.
Communities across Missouri have voiced concerns as CAFOs intrude into neighborhoods.
Just since 2023, 22 CAFO permits have been proposed for Barry, Lawrence, McDonald and Newton counties, and the seven permits currently being considered by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) would allow 52 new barns and a whopping 2.5 million chickens in Lawrence and Newton.
This is an unacceptable level of concentration and density in the area. A key concern is our karst topography, which includes caves and underground rivers. CAFO waste could significantly  contaminate our groundwater according to the DNR’s own report..
This raises critical questions about the role of government and elected “representatives” in safeguarding the rights of Missourians. Are they truly representatives of the people, justice and welfare, or are they succumbing to external pressures that compromise the foundational ideals of our democratic process? It is in these moments that the responsibility of civic engagement becomes paramount, urging citizens to hold their representatives accountable and ensure that the welfare of the people remains the supreme law.
It may not be in your backyard now, but if we don’t act, it could be in your next glass of water.
This is a statewide issue. If the DNR is unwilling to do their job, then we need a legislative fix. A departmental resolution should be just the beginning. We need to repeal the 2019 law and let local governments address this problem.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hog-getty-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 06:58:55.560802

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to abortion three years ago in a landmark ruling known as Dobbs, the national conversation on reproductive rights has centered on states that have banned or restricted the procedure.
That largely excludes states like New Jersey where Dobbs drove state legislators to protect and expand abortion access. But the Trump administration’s crusade to torpedo Democratic policies nationwide has ignited fears in New Jersey that those abortion protections could fall.
“Those laws are untested, so we don’t even know how they will hold up,” said Kaitlyn Wojtowicz, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey. “We are attuned to the fact that we may need new responses to this administration, because the attacks have been really unprecedented and just really draconian and cruel.”
A bit of paralysis on this issue has set in at the Trenton Statehouse since President Trump retook the White House in January, with legislators taking no action this year on nine bills they announced last June that are intended to expand abortion protections here.
The bills’ supporters say the legislative inaction cannot continue if New Jersey wants to remain a state that can brag about its reproductive rights protections — as it has done on billboards in states like Texas, where abortion is largely banned.
“It’s not a moment to sleep on our laurels,” said Alejandra Sorto of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. “We need immediate and courageous action against what’s happening at the federal level. It isn’t a wait-and-see moment at all.”

 Federal threats

Trump’s crackdown on immigration has been his most visible agenda priority, but a crackdown on abortion rights has been underway, too, even though Trump had vowed during his campaign to leave abortion policy to states.
New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin has fought the Trump administration on abortion rights, joining a multi-state petition to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to drop restrictions on the abortion medication mifepristone and battling anti-abortion pregnancy centers in court.
Still, abortion rights advocates said New Jersey patients could feel the repercussions of national restrictions soon.
Sorto, the ACLU-NJ’s associate director of civic engagement, pointed to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recent order for the FDA to review mifepristone. Such medications are used in about two-thirds of pregnancy terminations.
The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit last year to restrict mifepristone, but abortion rights advocates fear the Trump administration could revoke federal approval of the drug. Gov. Phil Murphy said in January that New Jersey would begin stockpiling mifepristone “so every woman can access this crucial form of reproductive care.”
Wojtowicz warned that threats to yank Planned Parenthood’s funding also threaten access here. The budget bill now before Congress would cut Medicaid funding to nonprofit abortion providers.
“It doesn’t name Planned Parenthood directly, but it’s tailored in such a way that it’s really targeting Planned Parenthood health centers,” Wojtowicz said.
Those cuts could force up to 200 Planned Parenthood clinics to close across the country, she said. The nonprofit, which has 23 health centers in New Jersey, is a significant provider of abortion in the Garden State. About a third of Planned Parenthood patients here rely on Medicaid, Wojtowicz said.
Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers around the country already had lost substantial funding during the first Trump presidency.
“It’s devastating for access. This isn’t a red-state or blue-state thing. This is an everywhere issue,” Wojtowicz said. “We don’t see this as an ‘if Planned Parenthood is defunded’ issue. We see it as a ‘when.’”
New Jersey residents seeking abortions also should be concerned about security — both the privacy of their patient data and their physical safety, said Brittany Holom-Trundy, a senior policy analyst at progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective.
She pointed to the Trump administration sharing Medicaid enrollee data with deportation officials, as well as controversial data-mining the administration has done with impacts that aren’t fully clear yet. And in a ruling this month that applies nationally, a federal judge in Texas struck down a 2024 federal rule that shielded reproductive health information from disclosure to law enforcement when care was legally obtained, such as in another state with abortion access.
The Trump administration also has largely stopped enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, a 1994 federal law that set criminal penalties for people who harass or threaten anyone entering or leaving an abortion clinic. Trump in January pardoned 23 people convicted under the act.
“This is a scary time for that aspect of things,” Holom-Trundy said.
One of the bills now stalled in Trenton would strengthen data privacy for patients who receive reproductive health care. Another would essentially codify the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act here.
“We need to protect data security, making sure data can’t be accessed or taken, but we also need to protect physical security, of providers and patients,” Holom-Trundy said. “We need to ensure that we as a state are ensuring that people don’t fear seeking the care that they need, and that they won’t be targeted by political violence when they do so.”
 Senate President Nicholas Scutari said he is “as pro-choice as they come” and would agree to a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights in New Jersey. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
 Meanwhile, in Trenton …

Even before Dobbs, New Jersey legislators had acted to codify the right to abortion into state law. Other protections followed, including a mandate requiring some health insurers to cover abortion care in full and a law banning the extradition of people who get or give abortions in New Jersey to states that criminalize it.
Rising abortion rates suggest some of those laws are working. Abortion providers in New Jersey performed close to 5,000 abortions a month by last December, up from about 4,000 terminations a month before Dobbs, new data from the Society of Family Planning shows.
“We’re seeing people from places where we just never would have before, like Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Ohio,” Wojtowicz said.
One measure in the nine-bill package now stalled in Trenton could help abortion providers fundraise. It would allow New Jersey taxpayers to donate part or all of their refund to a state abortion fund, and proceeds would be distributed annually to the three reproductive health providers in New Jersey who serve the most Medicaid patients.
Other bills in the “Reproductive Freedom and Health Equity” package would make abortion more accessible on college campuses and create a new crime for those who interfere with reproductive care.
The Assembly hasn’t acted on any of the bills since they were introduced last June. The Senate stalled on them after passing one and advancing four others in committee.
Holom-Trundy suspects the Trump administration’s unpredictability has derailed momentum on state legislation.
“I’m always frustrated by a lack of movement on important things,” Holom-Trundy said. “Uncertainty can cause a paralysis. Uncertainty can lead people to say, ‘Let’s just wait and see,’ and take a more reactive approach to what happens outside of their control. I would encourage them to instead take a proactive approach. Even though you can’t predict right now exactly what’s going to happen, you can see that there are threats to this care and to access and to security and to privacy.”
Democrats Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin and Assemblywoman Shanique Speight, prime sponsor on all nine bills, did not respond to requests for comment.
Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), who wields great power over what legislation moves as Senate President, told the New Jersey Monitor he’s “as pro-choice as they come” and had been willing to seek an amendment to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution.
He also gave a chilling nod to the volatility of abortion politics now.
“Don’t try to get me killed out here. I mean, that’s what killed those people in Minnesota,” he said.
A gunman assassinated a Minnesota state legislator and her husband and seriously wounded another legislator and his wife earlier this month in a rampage investigators suspect was motivated by anti-abortion extremism. The gunman, who was arrested, also planned to target abortion providers, investigators said.
Scutari said he wasn’t holding up the bills for any particular reason but added: “If the Assembly doesn’t move anything, sometimes we’re like: ‘Well, we’re wasting time and energy that we could have for other bills.’”
“I can’t really speak to the specific bills, because I only have, like, 7,000 to review, but in the general sense, I’m always in favor of additional pro-choice protections,” he said. “If there’s more that needs to be done, and the sponsors contact me about it, I will never stand in the way of that.”
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex), prime sponsor on all nine bills, said she wants to see them become law before a new governor replaces Murphy in January. Lawmakers now are preoccupied with passing a state budget, as they must do by the end of June, and then will recess for the summer, she added. She expects the reproductive rights bills will become a legislative priority in the fall.
“We know what’s at stake here and what we have to do to protect New Jersey,” Ruiz said.
Murphy has urged legislators to act on one of the bills — a measure to eliminate copays for reproductive health care — in state-of-the-state addresses this year and last year.
His budget plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1 includes more than $50 million for family planning services, facility upgrades, and growing the reproductive health care workforce, said Murphy spokeswoman Natalie Hamilton.
“Three years after the disastrous Dobbs decision, Governor Murphy is eager to sign additional legislation further protecting and expanding reproductive rights and health care access in New Jersey. He urges the Legislature to act without delay,” Hamilton said.

Her doctor and several pharmacies turned her down because she was below the recommended age at the time, which was 60. So, in 2016, she celebrated her 60th birthday at her local CVS.
“I was there when they opened,” Beckham recalled. After getting her Zostavax shot, she said, “I felt really relieved.” She has since received the newer, more effective shingles vaccine, as well as a pneumonia shot, an RSV vaccine to guard against respiratory syncytial virus, annual flu shots and all recommended covid-19 vaccinations.
Some older people are really eager to be vaccinated.
Robin Wolaner, 71, a retired publisher in Sausalito, California, has been known to badger friends who delay getting recommended shots, sending them relevant medical studies. “I’m sort of hectoring,” she acknowledged.
Deana Hendrickson, 66, who provides daily care for three young grandsons in Los Angeles, sought an additional MMR shot, though she was vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella as a child, in case her immunity to measles had waned.
For older adults who express more confidence in vaccine safety than younger groups, the past few months have brought welcome research. Studies have found important benefits from a newer vaccine and enhanced versions of older ones, and one vaccine may confer a major bonus that nobody foresaw.
The new studies are coming at a fraught political moment. The nation’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has long disparaged certain vaccines, calling them unsafe and saying that the government officials who regulate them are compromised and corrupt.
On June 9, Kennedy fired a panel of scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and later replaced them with some who have been skeptical of vaccines. But so far, Kennedy has not tried to curb access to the shots for older Americans.
The evidence that vaccines are beneficial remains overwhelming.
The phrase “Vaccines are not just for kids anymore” has become a favorite for William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
“The population over 65, which often suffers the worst impact of respiratory viruses and others, now has the benefit of vaccines that can prevent much of that serious illness,” he said.
Take influenza, which annually sends from 140,000 to 710,000 people to hospitals, most of them seniors, and is fatal to 10% of hospitalized older adults.
For about 15 years, the CDC has approved several enhanced flu vaccines for people 65 and older. More effective than the standard formulation, they either contain higher levels of the antigen that builds protection against the virus or incorporate an adjuvant that creates a stronger immune response. Or they’re recombinant vaccines, developed through a different method, with higher antigen levels.
In a meta-analysis in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, “all the enhanced vaccine products were superior to the standard dose for preventing hospitalizations,” said Rebecca Morgan, a health research methodologist at Case Western Reserve University and an author of the study.
Compared with the standard flu shot, the enhanced vaccines reduced the risk of hospitalization from the flu in older adults, by at least 11% and up to 18%. The CDC advises adults 65 and older to receive the enhanced vaccines, as many already do.
More good news: Vaccines to prevent respiratory syncytial virus in people 60 and older are performing admirably.
RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants, and it also poses significant risks to older people. “Season in and season out,” Schaffner said, “it produces outbreaks of serious respiratory illness that rivals influenza.”
Because the FDA first approved an RSV vaccine in 2023, the 2023-24 season provided “the first opportunity to see it in a real-world context,” said Pauline Terebuh, an epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and an author of a recent study in the journal JAMA Network Open.
In analyzing electronic health records for almost 800,000 patients, the researchers found the vaccines to be 75% effective against acute infection, meaning illness that was serious enough to send a patient to a health care provider.
The vaccines were 75% effective in preventing emergency room or urgent care visits, and 75% effective against hospitalization, both among those ages 60 to 74 and those older.
Immunocompromised patients, despite having a somewhat lower level of protection from the vaccine, will also benefit from it, Terebuh said. As for adverse effects, the study found a very low risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that causes muscle weakness and that typically follows an infection, in about 11 cases per 1 million doses of vaccine. That, she said, “shouldn’t dissuade people.”
The CDC now recommends RSV vaccination for people 75 and older, and for those 60 to 74 if they’re at higher risk of severe illness (from, say, heart disease).
As data from the 2024-25 season becomes available, researchers hope to determine whether the vaccine will remain a one-and-done, or whether immunity will require repeated vaccination.
People 65 and up express the greatest confidence in vaccine safety of any adult group, a KFF survey found in April. More than 80% said they were “very “or “somewhat confident” about MMR, shingles, pneumonia, and flu shots.
Although the covid vaccine drew lower support among all adults, more than two-thirds of older adults expressed confidence in its safety.
Even skeptics might become excited about one possible benefit of the shingles vaccine: This spring, Stanford researchers reported that over seven years, vaccination against shingles reduced the risk of dementia by 20%, a finding that made headlines.
Biases often undermine observational studies that compare vaccinated with unvaccinated groups. “People who are healthier and more health-motivated are the ones who get vaccinated,” said Pascal Geldsetzer, an epidemiologist at the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience at Stanford and lead author of the study.
“It’s hard to know whether this is cause and effect,” he said, “or whether they’re less likely to develop dementia anyway.”
So the Stanford team took advantage of a “natural experiment” when the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, was introduced in Wales. Health officials set a strict age cutoff: People who turned 80 on or before Sept. 1, 2013, weren’t eligible for vaccination, but those even slightly younger were eligible.
In the sample of nearly 300,000 adults whose birthdays fell close to either side of that date, almost half of the eligible group received the vaccine, but virtually nobody in the older group did.
“Just as in a randomized trial, these comparison groups should be similar in every way,” Geldsetzer explained. A substantial reduction in dementia diagnoses in the vaccine-eligible group, with a much stronger protective effect in women, therefore constitutes “more powerful and convincing evidence,” he said.
The team also found reduced rates of dementia after shingles vaccines were introduced in Australia and other countries. “We keep seeing this in one dataset after another,” Geldsetzer said.
In the United States, where a more potent vaccine, Shingrix, became available in 2017 and supplanted Zostavax, Oxford investigators found an even stronger effect.
By matching almost 104,000 older Americans who received a first dose of the new vaccine (full immunization requires two) with a group that had received the earlier formulation, they found delayed onset of dementia in the Shingrix group.
How a shingles vaccine might reduce dementia remains unexplained. Scientists have suggested that viruses themselves may contribute to dementia, so suppressing them could protect the brain. Perhaps the vaccine revs up the immune system in general or affects inflammation.
“I don’t think anybody knows,” said Paul Harrison, a psychiatrist at Oxford and a senior author of the study. But, he added, “I’m now convinced there’s something real here.”
Shingrix, now recommended for adults over 50, is 90% effective in preventing shingles and the lingering nerve pain that can result. In 2021, however, only 41% of adults 60 and older had received one dose of either shingles vaccine.
A connection to dementia will require further research, and Geldsetzer is trying to raise philanthropic funding for a clinical trial.
And “if you needed another reason to get this vaccine,” Schaffner said, “here it is.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)As a warming planet delivers more wildfires, hurricanes, and other threats, America’s once reliably boring home insurance market has become the place where climate shocks collide with people’s pocketbooks. 
The turmoil in insurance markets is a harbinger for an American economy that is built on real property. Without insurance, banks won’t issue a mortgage; without a mortgage, most people can’t buy a home. Communities that are deemed too dangerous to insure face the risk of falling property values, which means less tax dollars for schools, police and other basic services.                  
Oklahoma is now estimated to have the highest average cost of homeowners insurance in the United States. One recent analysis found Oklahomans pay an average of $6,210 per year. 
The national average for homeowners insurance, by the way, is $2,110 a year, according to the NerdWallet analysis. That means Oklahomans are paying 194% more than other American homeowners. The online site, which provides financial resources, said it looked at pricing data from over 100 insurance companies to calculate the average insurance cost. They looked at quotes for a 40-year-old that had good credit and needed $300,000 in both dwelling and liability coverage and who wanted a $1,000 deductible.
Enid has an unhappy distinction of being the place in Oklahoma where insurance is more costly than pretty much everywhere else in America.
Enid is certainly not a place that is unusually subject to severe weather. In fact, the federal government designates Garfield County, which includes Enid, as having a “relatively low” level of risk. Yet as the New York Times reported last year, as a percentage of home prices, insurance is more expensive in sections of Enid, than it was in a wildfire-ravaged area of California, the hurricane-prone New Orleans and Florida Keys, and North Carolina’s Outer Banks, which is grappling with homes sinking into the sea.
That same New York Times article cited federal data which showed that Oklahomans who live along the borders paid premiums 70% higher compared to residents living just over the state line in Arkansas, Kansas and Texas. Those counties had comparable exposure risks to natural disasters.                
It’s clear that climate change has increasingly produced damaging weather which can account, at least in part, for the drastic increase in home insurance, but there’s another reason that could explain Oklahoma’s skyrocketing costs. 
Recent research points to a surprising factor: Higher premiums are charged in states, like Oklahoma, where regulators are more lax in examining requests for rate increases. That means in Oklahoma insurers are basically able to charge whatever they want.
Glen Mulready, Oklahoma’s current insurance commissioner, has never once blocked an insurers’ rate increase request. In defending this position, he told The New York Times last year that it’s not his job to stop private insurance companies from raising rates. His belief is that competitive market forces, not regulation, is the best way to limit prices. 
It should be noted that from 2019 to 2022 Mulready received over $60,000 in political contributions from the insurance industry, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan group Open Secrets, which analyzes donor data. Those are the same folks he is supposed to regulate. Most of use would view this as a clear conflict of interest.
Ishita Sen, a professor at Harvard Business School, has found in her research that insurers do not adjust rates in highly-regulated states but rather compensate by raising them in less-regulated states. 
In a tightly regulated state, such as California, premiums tend to be priced below what they would be if they truly reflected the likelihood of damage from storms, fires or other disasters. She also discovered that after big losses in strongly regulated states, national insurance companies tend to raise rates in states with weaker rules. 
Oklahoma homeowners are effectively subsidizing homeowners in California and other states that have stricter rules governing insurance premiums.
This is one reason why it’s important for Oklahomans to think carefully when choosing our state’s next insurance commissioner when the post is next up for election in 2026. If Oklahomans are fed up with having higher premiums than the rest of the country, perhaps they should determine whether a candidate will act in the public interest.

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday afternoon that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land.
Rollins, speaking at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.
Fire officials say Idaho has ‘greater potential’ for significant wildfire season this summer

“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said.
The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy.
“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.”
 An end of ‘Roadless rule’ protections

The “Roadless Rule” repeal would mean more than 58 million acres of land in 38 states would lose their protections. In New Mexico, according to Forest Service data, about 1.6 million acres, or roughly 2,500 square miles, of land in all the state’s national forests have some level of protections. A 2003 Forest Service map suggests most of the areas losing protections are in the Santa Fe and Gila national forests.
In Idaho, there are more than 9.3 million inventoried roadless areas within the national forest system, according to the Forest Service data.
The announcement drew mixed reactions from the Western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said.
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office.
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation.
Trump breaks historic Columbia River deal between U.S. government, tribes, Northwest states

Rollins made the announcement during one of several keynote addresses by President Donald Trump’s cabinet members during the Western Governor’s Association conference. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spoke earlier Monday, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke afterward.
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “Western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”

Leslie got the job through a workforce development program for older adults that could see its funding eliminated by Congress. (Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.
But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

Attorneys who have fought for — and against — Trump on national stage will defend — and oppose — the new law in federal court. 
The post High-profile attorneys flock to lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law has drawn high-powered attorneys from across the country to the case, including several from a firm President Donald Trump hired to keep his name on the 2024 ballot. 
California-based Dhillon Law Group and Colorado’s Gessler Blue are representing Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who the complaint names as a defendant in his official capacity alongside the state’s 23 county clerks. 
Set to go into effect on July 1, the law requiring a person to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote, was a key priority of Gray’s and the right flank of the Wyoming Legislature. 
Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group, filed a lawsuit in May, alleging the new law will impose an undue burden on the right to vote and is unconstitutionally vague as written. 
Two firms represent the group — Colorado-based civil rights attorneys Killmer Lane as well as Elias Law Group, the country’s leading voting-rights litigators. 
It’s not unusual for the Wyoming Attorney General’s office to contract with outside counsel. In this case, it did so at Gray’s request.  
“The Dhillon Law Group, which was founded by Trump [Department of Justice] Attorney Harmeet Dhillon, as well as Scott Gessler, bring a wealth of knowledge and experience regarding election law and defense of the truth,” Gray told WyoFile in a statement. “They have shown themselves to be strong upholders of conservative values, including election integrity, when they worked with President Trump in the last few years on a variety of legal issues.”

Cheyenne’s Falen Law Offices will also represent Gray, according to court documents. 
The decision by both sides to hire high-powered attorneys raises the case’s profile and may indicate that a lengthy legal battle lies ahead. 
Elias Law Group
Before Marc Elias founded Elias Law Group in 2021, he served as general counsel for John Kerry and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns. And when Trump took to the courts to overturn the 2020 election, Elias prevailed in all but one of 65 related lawsuits. In 2024, Kamala Harris’ campaign hired Elias in anticipation of election certification battles and mass voter challenges that ultimately did not materialize. 
Currently, Elias Law Group is litigating 55 voting and election cases in 24 states, including Wyoming. 
“We are proud to represent the Equality State Policy Center in this critical lawsuit because Wyoming voters deserve free, fair, and secure elections in which all eligible citizen voters are able to freely participate,” Elisabeth Frost with Elias Law Firm wrote in a statement to WyoFile. 
“Every time a law like House Bill 156 has been passed it has caused citizen voters to be excluded from the process. Voting rights should not be a partisan issue and we are looking forward to making our case to the court,” Frost wrote. 
Both Gray and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus criticized Elias Law Group’s involvement in the case, with the latter calling the complaint a “meritless lawsuit.”

Dhillon Law Group and Scott Gessler 
While Elias worked against the overturning of the 2020 election, Harmeet Dhillon, a legal advisor to the Trump campaign, aimed to get the case in front of the country’s highest court. 
“We’re waiting for the United States Supreme Court — of which the president has nominated three justices — to step in and do something,” Dhillon told Fox Business at the time.
About 14 years prior, she founded Dhillon Law Group in San Francisco. During the pandemic, the firm sued California on behalf of those opposing stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. The firm also challenged the state’s switch to a mail-ballot election. 
In the last presidential election, Dhillon represented Trump against state-level efforts to remove him from the ballot for his role in inciting the Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol. 
That included a case in Colorado in which Dhillion worked alongside attorney and former Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler. 
“Democrats are conspiring to commit the biggest election interference fraud in world history, right before our eyes, as government officials avert their eyes to the mockery of the constitution and our laws,” Dhillon posted on X at the time. “This is a low point in American history.”

Gray also weighed in on the case, joining two other Republican secretaries of state in filing an amicus brief opposing a court’s decision to disqualify Trump from appearing on the ballot. 
Late last year, Trump appointed Dhillon to serve as the assistant attorney general leading the Civil Rights Division in the U.S. Department of Justice. Dhillon subsequently left the firm for the position. 
The case’s current status
As part of its legal challenge, attorneys for Equality State Policy Center filed a motion for preliminary injunction, asking the court to prevent the law from going into effect while the case plays out. 
On June 10, Gray’s attorneys asked the court for a three-week extension to file a response and to reconsider its decision not to hold a hearing. 
“It is reasonable to assume that the plaintiff has spent considerable time — well in advance of filing its complaint — to compile this evidence,” Gray’s attorneys wrote, referring to more than 500 pages of evidence ESPC provided to the court. 
“It would be unfair to limit defendant Gray to substantially less than two weeks to develop evidence to contest plaintiff’s claims. Defendant Gray anticipates that he will need to present the oral testimony of two to four witnesses, who will explain how Wyoming will implement the new law, thus enabling the court to fully understand the law’s implementation and effect on voters statewide.”
ESPC opposed Gray’s extension request, arguing that Gray’s public comments demonstrate that he “has been fully aware of this lawsuit and the preliminary injunction motion since they were filed.”
Ultimately, the court granted a partial extension to Gray, kept with its decision not to hold a hearing and highlighted an interview with the secretary. 
“To be sure, outside counsel’s assertion that they need additional time to prepare a defense to the preliminary-injunction request is certainly undercut by defendant Gray’s public statements on May 27, 2025 that he was then in the process of working with outside counsel ‘on preparing that vigorous defense on the preliminary injunction,’” U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl wrote.
Gray has until Friday to file a response.

State shouldn’t have to rely on courts to salvage Legislature’s incompetent funding of public schools, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Wyoming’s ‘universal’ school vouchers are a sinking ship appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature’s school voucher program makes me think of the Titanic. Like a hastily built luxury liner that sinks to the bottom of the ocean, the program that uses public money on private education is going down, hopefully never to resurface.

Opinion

I’ve got about 3,818 other analogies — coincidentally the number of student applications the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act had received by last week — but I think the stark imagery above should show you that I think the state’s latest “universal school choice” gambit is destined to be a colossal failure that won’t survive. The courts will take it down.
And the legislators who gave us this mess will scream, even though it’s 100% their fault.
The Wyoming Education Association and nine parents of K-12 students recently sued the state to throw out this abomination that was created by the far right to end public education as we know it. 
The $7,000 in school vouchers the program provides parents annually to send their kiddos to private or parochial schools is inherently unconstitutional, and lawmakers knew that but proceeded anyway, wasting time and public resources.
I can’t imagine any court in the state, including the Wyoming Supreme Court, where this will eventually land, could look at the Wyoming Constitution and do anything but reject the voucher program.
“Nor shall any portion of any public school fund ever be used to support or assist any private school, or any school, academy, seminary, college or other institution of learning controlled by any church or sectarian organization or religious denomination whatsoever,” Article 7, Section 8 reads.
It doesn’t take a legal scholar like Madeline Matlock, Perry Mason or even Judge Judy to understand this constitutional prohibition on public funding of private schools. What Wyoming’s founders wanted is written in plain English; the issue is black and white.
But like a classic disaster movie with a tragic ending, the main characters knew school vouchers were unconstitutional and plowed ahead anyway.
To play devil’s advocate, let’s say the state has an “out” in other constitutional language that allows the spending of public funds only for the necessary support of the poor. That’s how the Legislature in 2024 tried to justify passage of its first school voucher program, “Educational Savings Accounts.”
Lawmakers set income guidelines for families to qualify for up to $6,000 per child per year to pay for private tuition or other expenses. It was a weak argument because the constitution doesn’t say there could be an educational exception to help the poor. The WEA’s lawsuit calls it an example of “gratuitously funneling public funds to private individuals and entities, regardless of whether they are poor and regardless of whether that support is necessary.” 
The 2025 bill to expand the ESA program passed despite objections from moderate Republicans who said the state would spend time and tons of money in court to defend it.
The Freedom Caucus stomped its feet to protest any income limits, damn the costs, because other red states demanded “universal” school choice and got it. The caucus claimed those successes proved Wyoming’s version would stand up in court, neglecting the real-life repercussions of such programs. Arizona, for example, spent $332 million on its expanded universal voucher system last year, while facing a $1.3 billion state budget deficit.
What I find really rich about Wyoming’s far-right reaction to the WEA and parents’ lawsuit is summed up by Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder’s complaints.
In a statement to WyoFile, Degenfelder decried the education association’s “left-wing lawfare” and called the timing of the lawsuit “deeply” troubling.
“To wait until two weeks before the [ESA] funds are to begin distribution to ask for an injunction is devastating to the nearly 4,000 Wyoming families that have signed up for the program and the many service providers that are counting on those families,” Degenfelder said. “This is reckless and our Wyoming children are the collateral damage.”
No, what’s reckless and troubling — and should be clear to voters — is that despite the WEA and other opponents repeatedly pointing out the unconstitutionality of such bills for several years, the Freedom Caucus and state officials like Degenfelder paid absolutely no attention. They stumbled toward their goal of universal school choice, spiking the ball in victory before reaching the end zone (i.e., not developing a clear legal strategy to defend an unconstitutional law in court).
The Legislature should look at the outcome of all the lawsuits filed over its long history of education funding and realize what we all know: It sucks at this. 
In a series of landmark rulings dating back to the 1980s, the Wyoming Supreme Court has always found the state hasn’t followed the constitutional mandate to fund a public K-12 system that provides a high-quality and equitable education for all students. The constitution’s education clause states, “The Legislature shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.”
The most recent lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the state’s school funding formula was filed three years ago by the WEA and eight school districts, who maintained the state has withheld appropriate funding at the expense of educational excellence, safety and security.
On Feb. 26, Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher ordered the Legislature to fix a funding formula that he wrote negatively impacted children’s right to a proper education. The next day, the House and Senate reached a compromise despite some major disagreements and passed the school voucher bill.
The Legislature, in my view, effectively told the courts, “You think how we fund public schools is so bad? Wait until you see the damage we can do with our new school voucher program.”
While simultaneously defending this unconstitutional program in court, the state will be following the rigorous “recalibration” process the courts have ordered it to use every five years to reset its school funding formula. If you’ve never had the soul-crushing experience of spending countless hours at these public hearings, let me explain what “recalibration” does. 
The state hires independent consultants for a considerable amount of money to detail what should be in the “basket of goods” — what public schools offer students — and how much to spend. The consultants develop a well-reasoned and legally defensible model that is higher than the state currently spends.
The Legislature’s Select Committee on School Finance Recalibration hears the consultants’ recommendations, thanks them for their service, and chucks the whole report. Then, lawmakers draft a bill that cuts education funding while passing measures like the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act that leave even less funds on the table for public schools.
Like the incompetent builders of leaky boats, the architects of the school voucher bill knew what was coming. This is on them, but we’ll all pay for it.

Casting doubt on a system without evidence erodes confidence in vaccines that have protected generations of children from disease, five Wyoming doctors write.
The post Wyoming pediatricians: Restoring trust begins with facts, not fear appeared first on WyoFile .","Vaccines are one of the most successful public health tools in human history. In Wyoming and across the nation, they have prevented countless hospitalizations, permanent disabilities and early deaths. As pediatricians, we see firsthand every day how vaccination protects children and their families. That’s why we are deeply concerned by recent developments at the federal level that risk undermining public trust in this life-saving work. 

Opinion

Recently, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the mass dismissal of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the independent panel of scientists and clinicians that reviews vaccine safety and makes recommendations. His rationale centered on vague claims that the committee has failed to exercise proper oversight due to alleged conflicts of interest.
Let us be clear: Questioning science is healthy. But discarding experts and casting suspicion on decades of transparent, peer-reviewed work — without providing meaningful evidence of wrongdoing — does not rebuild trust. It erodes it.
The facts tell a very different story.
ACIP’s meetings are open to the public, webcast live, and archived online with detailed agendas and minutes available for anyone to review. Anyone can attend, watch or submit public comment. 
Meeting materials and livestreams are available at https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings.
When Secretary Kennedy criticizes ACIP for “never rejecting a vaccine,” he overlooks the committee’s actual role. The panel only reviews vaccines after the FDA has completed its rigorous approval process. Its recommendations focus on whether the vaccine should be added to the U.S. immunization schedule based on safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness and population health impact. If a safety signal emerges post-approval — as happened with the Rotashield vaccine in the late 1990s — ACIP will update or withdraw recommendations accordingly. That’s not rubber-stamping; that’s scientific vigilance in action.
Concerns about conflict of interest have been raised in the past — most notably in a 2000 congressional report and 2009 Inspector General review. In response, reforms were implemented: ACIP members must now publicly disclose financial interests, complete annual ethics training and recuse themselves from discussions involving potential conflicts. The CDC posts each member’s financial disclosure on its website and assigns ethics officials to review them. These processes are not just guidelines — they are legal and structural safeguards designed to preserve integrity.
Do we believe these systems can be continually improved? Absolutely. But we also believe in defending institutions that, when operating transparently and with integrity, serve the public good.
Casting doubt without evidence does not reform — it destabilizes.
The current ACIP vaccination schedule is the product of decades of rigorous scientific research and real-world evidence. It is carefully designed to protect children and communities from serious, potentially life-threatening diseases at the ages when they are most vulnerable. Each vaccine on the schedule has undergone extensive safety testing and continuous monitoring, and the schedule itself is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect the best available data. The result is one of the safest and most effective public health tools we have, responsible for saving millions of lives and dramatically reducing rates of once-common childhood illnesses.
Wyoming families know the stakes. We continue to see measles and pertussis outbreaks resurface where vaccine rates fall. As pediatricians, we’ve cared for infants too young to be vaccinated, relying on the immunity of their community to protect them. We’ve seen firsthand the protection that vaccines offer to Wyoming families and children and the consequences when that protection is missed.
This isn’t about politics. It’s about protecting kids, preserving science-based medicine and continuing to earn the trust of families through humility, transparency and fact.
We empathize with parents and guardians who feel torn between competing messages in our modern media landscape. Wyoming’s pediatricians will always listen. We will always answer your questions. And we will always stand up for the tools that keep our children safe.

Leslie got the job through a workforce development program for older adults that could see its funding eliminated by Congress. (Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
Congressional chaos
The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

She is a licensed master’s-level social worker. (Photo courtesy of CATCH)Stephanie Day, the executive director of CATCH, has worked the better part of two decades trying to solve the problem with homelessness in southwest Idaho.
The Idaho Legislature has its own solution. On July 1, it will become a crime to sleep (in cars or otherwise) on public sidewalks, parks or public property regardless of the availability of emergency shelter beds. Cities that fail to enforce the law are subject to fines. The bill was labeled an “anti-camping” bill. It applies only to the larger cities in the Treasure Valley – Boise, Meridian, Nampa and Caldwell.
Boise housing organization seeks donations for people experiencing homelessness in summer heat

In Day’s view, the bill (Senate Bill 1141) has nothing to do with camping and everything to do with making life tougher for people facing homelessness.
“Camping is supposed to be fun, but we’re talking about people who are living unsheltered,” Day told me. “It’s not fun, and they are not making smores.”
Cassidy Landry of Eagle, who experienced homelessness first-hand in 2019, expressed her thoughts recently in a letter to the bill’s sponsors – Sen. Codi Galloway of Boise and Rep. Bruce Skaug of Nampa.
“It isn’t anti-camping, it’s anti-survival. During the months I spent sleeping in my car, I wasn’t embracing an outdoor lifestyle … I was simply trying to survive,” Landry said in her letter. “Today, I am successfully housed and stable because I had the opportunity to survive during these critical months. Passing SB1141 takes away that chance of survival and eventual success.”
The effective date for the new law couldn’t come at a worse time, according to Day.
“The summer months are when the most folks are unsheltered. It’s the busiest time of the year for our team,” Day says. “During the cold of winter, friends and family often let those without homes stay with them, but that changes as it warms up.”
Landry has personal experience with summer homelessness – a time when being handed a bottle of water becomes an act of kindness. Last year she wrote a commentary for Idaho Education News, discussing her experience.
“My car, which I once considered a safe haven, transformed into an unbearable oven under the relentless sun,” she wrote. “Sleep was elusive, and each morning I woke up exhausted, drenched in sweat and dreading the day ahead.”
Those hardships, according to Day, don’t always register on society – or the Statehouse politicians.
“A small percentage of the community will ever experience homelessness,” Day says. “On some level, when we drive by people who are living outdoors and are OK with their situation, we are not seeing them as fully human. There’s a feeling that those who are homeless should go to shelters, but there’s not enough space. There are more than 2,600 individuals experiencing homelessness in Ada County, and only 568 shelter beds.”
And, as Cassidy found out, the shelters are not necessarily the most inviting places – which is why she chose to live in her car.
In Day’s world, the law is one more challenge for CATCH to find housing for the homeless. Getting “affordable” housing, with sky-high rentals, is another issue. But CATCH managed to help 114 families last year and has served as a morale lifeline for many others.
Cassidy was one of the success stories. She found her way to Boise after a messy divorce in Houston, Texas, battled through unemployment, drug addiction and spent much of 2019 living in her car. 
Today, she’s living in an apartment in Eagle with her 11-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter and says that life is good. She has a bachelor’s degree in social science, with an eye toward getting a master’s degree. She is starting a nonprofit that is aimed at providing one-stop shopping for social resources.
“I’m working on building that up, going to school and raising my babies,” she said. She’s also working at “paying it forward” with CATCH, telling her story to anyone willing to listen. 
Homelessness is a complicated matter, but Day says the solution is quite simple, although horribly difficult to pull off.
“We know what to do with the various levels of programming,” she said. “The problem is getting enough people moving in the same direction. It comes down to will and coordination.”

A federal suit seeks to invalidate a new Tennessee law that would make it a felony to “harbor” immigrants without legal status.
The legislation set to take effect July 1, the suit argues, is unconstitutional, infringes on religious freedom and is written vaguely enough to ensnare churches that act as “safe zones” for school children during weather emergencies, landlords whose tenants take in roommates living illegally in the United States and family members living in mixed immigration status homes.
Filed Friday in the Middle District of Tennessee, the lawsuit seeks an immediate injunction to prevent the law from taking effect while litigation plays out in court. It also seeks class action status going forward.
The suit was brought on behalf of the Southeastern Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, whose Tennessee-based churches provide shelter, sanctuary, English instruction and other services to immigrants regardless of status. 
Bills that target immigrant-serving nonprofits raise criticism from faith community 

Other plaintiffs include a landlord whose tenant took in roommates without legal status and a father who has legal immigration status but family members in his home who do not.
“This law forces religious organizations to choose between following their values or falling in line. It forces family members — spouses, siblings, even parents — to fear that simply living under the same roof as a loved one without legal status could land them behind bars,” read a statement by Spring Miller of the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, which is among a group of organizations providing legal representation. 
“This isn’t just unintended consequences of a bad policy. This is using the law to inflict cruelty and control,” Miller’s statement said.
The law, introduced by Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis and Rep. Chris Todd of Madison County, both Republicans, creates a new felony offense for any individual who “intentionally conceals, harbors, or shields from detection” a person known to be residing illegally in the United States for “commercial advantage or private financial gain.” It defines the offense as “human smuggling.” 
The felony carries a punishment of one to six years in prison and a fine of up to $3,000.
At the time the bill was introduced, Taylor said it was designed, in part, to hold non-governmental agencies, or NGOs, accountable for their roles in providing services that keep immigrants without legal status in Tennessee communities. 
Taylor included churches, noting that “even Heaven has an immigration policy.”
“There’s a very specific way you come into heaven to become a resident of heaven,” Taylor said in a February interview with the Lookout once the bill was introduced. “They’ve got a very strict immigration policy, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable for Americans to have an immigration policy that people follow.”
The legislation drew pushback from clergy and immigrant advocates as it wound through the legislative process.
As written, the legislation defines the term “harbor” as to “provide shelter” but does not define shelter, which “thus purports to criminalize a broad range of innocuous everyday activities providing shelter to immigrants,” the lawsuit alleges.
Tennessee bill to criminalize ‘harboring or hiding” immigrants without legal status advances

Those activities include parents providing housing to an undocumented child who helps pay the bills, a charity that accepts contributions to provide shelter to immigrants without legal status, or churches that rely on donations to give English-as-a-second-language instruction.
Todd, the measure’s cosponsor, said Monday he would be surprised if the legislation would ultimately be found unconstitutional.
“I don’t know how punishing a crime could be unconstitutional,” Todd said. “I mean literally smuggling people, many of which are being smuggled into human trafficking and this just gives law enforcement and our DAs another tool to try to prevent innocent folks from being put into trafficking situations more than anything else.”
Todd also disputed the law could be applied to churches or clergy providing shelter, or individuals housing family members without legal status.
“I don’t know many charities that make money off of hiding people and harboring people,” he said.  “So I just don’t think that’s a thing.”
The lawsuit alleges Tennessee’s law is also a violation of the First Amendment rights of Lutheran Synod churches, pastors, staff and congregations, who provide shelter and other services to immigrants regardless of immigration status as an “expression of their faith.”
The Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA) in 2015 adopted a commitment to “accompany migrant families today and in the future,” the lawsuit said. The ELCA has “declared that walking alongside immigrants and refugees is a matter of faith” and “a crucial expression of baptismal identity.” 
The suit takes issue with the law’s definition of an unlawful immigrant as based on a determination by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a law enforcement agency that does not, on its own, make determinations of an individual’s immigration status. And it alleges that the state is illegally usurping the authority of the federal government, which alone is charged with immigration enforcement.
Attorneys filing the suit are with the American Immigration Council, Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center
The legislation was among a slate introduced by Tennessee Republican leaders in support of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration during the Tennessee General Assembly’s most recent legislative session.
Republican lawmakers also approved a proposal by Gov. Bill Lee to create a Centralized Immigration Enforcement Division to coordinate with the Trump Administration on immigration enforcement and encourage local authorities to partner with the federal government in enforcing immigration law. A bill that would have allowed public school districts to deny admission to children who could not show proof of lawful immigration status failed to pass after widespread and vocal protests at the State Capitol.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for select Tennessee counties on Friday, opening the door to federal recovery support for individuals and county governments that suffered costly damage from April storms.
The decision comes more than two months after severe storms battered Middle and West Tennessee, bringing destructive tornadoes and once-in-a-generation flooding that killed 10 people and damaged hundreds of homes.
The declaration opens federal funding to individuals in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties. Individual assistance can include temporary housing and home repair grants, low-cost loans to cover uninsured losses and other post-disaster support services. FEMA instructs individuals to file claims with their insurance providers before applying for federal assistance.
A federal cost-share to help cover emergency work, repair and replacement expenses on public property is also available to the state, eligible local governments and some nonprofit organizations. Public assistance is available in 19 counties: Cheatham, Davidson, Decatur, Dyer, Fayette, Gibson, Grundy, Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, Henry, Hickman, Lauderdale, Madison, McNairy, Obion, Perry, Stewart and Tipton.
Federal assistance will cover 75% of eligible recovery costs under the public assistance program, a FEMA spokesperson confirmed Monday. The state and local governments are required to cover the remaining 25%. Historically, Tennessee has split the 25% share evenly with local governments.
Gov. Bill Lee originally requested individual assistance for 15 counties and public assistance for up to 30 counties, in addition to Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funding for the state to use toward preventative measures to reduce future risk and harm from natural disasters. Hazard mitigation assistance remains under review. 
Damage to public property and the cost of recovery services is expected to exceed $26 million, according to preliminary assessments conducted by local, state and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials. That estimate does not include individual losses, which can be more difficult to calculate. Tennessee’s emergency management agency estimated around 300 homes and 14 businesses or nonprofits were severely damaged. 
In McNairy County — where an EF-3 tornado with wind speeds up to 160 miles per hour killed five people and devastated swaths of Selmer, the county seat — residents and business owners suffered an estimated $27.6 million in private property damage, according to the county’s emergency management agency. Damage to public property, roads, utilities, and government facilities in McNairy County totaled another $2.7 million, according to preliminary assessments. A joint assessment with help from federal officials found the damages eligible for FEMA’s public assistance program totaled closer to $4 million.
Gov. Lee: Multi-year string of disasters has exhausted state resources
Tennessee is the last state to receive the declaration from the Trump administration following April storms that also ripped through parts of Arkansas, Kentucky and Mississippi.
The president has sole authority to grant a disaster declaration and therefore allow access to FEMA’s assistance programs. After a disaster, local and state governments begin to assess the cost of the damage, sometimes with help from federal personnel. Governors then use these figures to request federal assistance from the president. FEMA uses per-capita cost thresholds to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves and the agency makes recommendations to the president, but meeting those thresholds doesn’t guarantee presidential approval.
Report: Under proposed higher FEMA threshold, recovery would cost TN $468M more from 2008-2024

The administration has indicated that it plans to reduce the amount of federal assistance available to states through FEMA after natural disasters, requiring states to bear more of the financial responsibility for recovery. Trump initially denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration after March tornadoes, but later relented and approved individual and public assistance.
State requests for disaster declarations are on the rise, and over the last 25 years, states in the Lower Mississippi River Basin saw five approvals for every one denial, as compared to a 2-1 approval ratio from 1953 to 1999. Tennessee has received nearly $1.2 billion in federal aid following natural disasters since 1953, according to FEMA data. 
Tennessee has experienced 18 major disaster declarations in the last five years, according to Lee’s letter to the Trump administration requesting federal aid following April’s storms.
The state has managed multiple disasters that have not risen to the level of a presidential disaster declaration on its own, ranging from winter storms in January 2023 to tornadoes and wildfires in 2024 and severe flooding in February 2025 that left much of the small West Tennessee town of Rives underwater, according to Lee’s request.
Recovery continues for 23 major disaster declarations that remain open in Tennessee, including recovery from Tropical Storm Helene. The state allocated $500 million toward Helene recovery efforts.
These efforts have exhausted state resources “to such an extent that they have strained and will continue to impact budgets for current and past calendar years,” Lee’s letter states.

The Executive Committee of the Legislative Council, made up of party leaders in both chambers, voted to approve the pilot program last week.
Committee audio is currently livestreamed on the Legislature’s website. The video pilot program will enable video via fixed cameras in five committee rooms from August until November this year. There are a handful of committees scheduled for that time period, including a meetings of the Black Coloradan Racial Equity Study Commission, Legislative Audit Committee and Joint Budget Committee.

After the pilot concludes, legislative leadership will review public feedback of the experience and a report from Legislative Council Staff’s Information Technology department to determine whether it should completely implement the video capability.
It would cost $20,000 to set up and $50,000 annually to maintain the system, according to Zack Wimberly with LCS. He is still determining if the pilot program would have a cost to set up, he said.
Manish Jani, LCS’s deputy director, told lawmakers on Wednesday that the pilot program may not be as comprehensive as a fully-implemented one, and might not cover every scenario in a committee room that could arise during a regular session, such as a lengthy hearing with a long list of witnesses.
“The outlier scenarios may not be factored into the pilot, but it should give us a solid perspective on what the experience would look like,” he said.

Leslie got the job through a workforce development program for older adults that could see its funding eliminated by Congress. (Anna Claire Vollers | Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
Isolated and unsure
Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
‘Lost in D.C.’
On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
Congressional chaos
The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
Future possibilities
Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

A government watchdog says it’s unclear when — or even whether — we’ll know going forward how the end of national abortion protections impact Americans’ health outcomes, livelihoods and financial futures as the federal government turns away from abortion data collection indefinitely.
A report released Monday by the Government Accountability Office and first shared exclusively with The 19th analyzed the existing data on the economic impact of abortion bans and found that government tracking has been very limited — and could become more so due to changes made by the Trump administration.
The last federal data on the impact of abortion bans ends in 2022, when Roe v. Wade was overturned. That data is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been collecting data on the number of abortions and the demographics of those who obtain them in its Abortion Surveillance report for almost six decades.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

Since publishing the 2022 data in November (data is typically released on a two-year delay), it’s unclear whether the agency plans to continue the research. Though the CDC’s survey is voluntary and limited in scope — some states, including California, for example, don’t provide information — the report was one of the most reliable sources of government abortion data.
Without it, there is no detailed federal data on what has happened since Roe was overturned. Tuesday marks three years since the landmark Supreme Court case was reversed in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision.
“According to Department of Health and Human Services officials we spoke to in May 2025, the agency, which includes CDC, is undergoing a realignment,” the nonpartisan GAO, which provides independent research for Congress and executive agencies, wrote in its report. “Officials were uncertain whether the resulting changes at the agency would affect future data collection efforts, including data on abortions.”
For its analysis, GAO contacted seven federal agencies to ask what efforts they were undertaking to assess the economic effects of state abortion restrictions. Only the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Chief Actuary said it planned to consider the economic impact of abortion restrictions in some of its upcoming work. The agency uses CDC data to make predictions about birth rates and whether any impact from abortion bans could affect the broader economy and the size of the labor force.
But the agency told GAO it will require three years of abortion data since Roe v. Wade was overturned to be able to come to any conclusion and, even then, the data over that period is so limited it may be too insufficient to be reliable.
All of it hinges on whether the CDC continues to collect state abortion data at all. The CDC did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Already, the Trump administration has moved to eliminate research on abortion. In January, Trump issued an executive order blocking data collection measuring the effect of access to reproductive care, including abortion care. The administration scrubbed several references to abortion on the Department of Health and Human Services’ website.
That data could potentially illuminate for lawmakers the myriad effects abortion restrictions can have. Beyond the health consequences, lack of abortion access can destabilize people economically, affecting everything from where they choose to live to whether they can stay employed.
“Not only does the new report show impacts of these harmful bans in stark terms, it also raises red flags about the government’s ability to collect important economic data due to the Trump Administration’s attacks on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies,” said Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia, in a statement to The 19th. The investigation into the data was requested by Scott and Sen. Richard Blumental, a New York Democrat.
For its report released Monday, GAO had to instead turn to 55 rigorously researched studies conducted over the past seven years, including from the Guttmacher Institute and research published in peer-reviewed medical journals such as JAMA and the American Journal of Public Health. GAO also spoke with four academic researchers and three national organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
Blumental called the report “irrefutable” evidence of the impact the Dobbs ruling has on the financial stability of women.
“There’s a proven connection between slashed reproductive freedoms and devastating financial distress. Unsafe and unintended pregnancies have huge costs — in lives and dollars — impacting all of us,” Blumental said in a statement to The 19th. “This fact-based document is a searing indictment of Dobbs on its third anniversary.”
According to the research, getting an abortion has become more expensive since some states banned the procedure, requiring patients to often take time off work to travel to a state with abortion access, plus the cost of that travel, the care itself and any child care expenses. It amounts to a “significant expense for low-income families,” GAO found.
One 2021 study out of Tennessee showed that even the introduction of a mandatory, 48-hour waiting period in 2015 that required two visits to get an abortion caused the average cost to rise by several hundred dollars.
Abortion access also impacts other decisions people make around where to live and whether they get an education. One 2023 study that GAO highlighted found that working women with at least a bachelor’s degree were more than 7 percent more likely to move to a state without restrictions than one with it. Another post-Roe study found that Black women living in states with abortion restrictions as teenagers were less likely than Black women in other states to enter college and complete it.
People who are unable to get an abortion then face worse financial outcomes in the months and years that follow. GAO cites findings from the Turnaway Study, a massive abortion research project that followed 1,000 women over 10 years studying the ways that being denied an abortion reshaped their lives.
Historically, about half of people who seek abortions live in poverty, and economic stability is one of the top reasons they seek an abortion in the first place. Many cite concerns around caring for the children they already have.
The United States’ lacks a strong social safety net for parents — those on food assistance programs can’t use the funds they receive to buy diapers, for instance; mothers on the federal assistance program for low-income women and children are deeply restricted in what formula they can buy with government assistance; and child care across the country is now costlier than in-state tuition in 41 states. For a single parent, child care costs swallow a third of their income on average (and in some states as much as half).
The Turnaway Study found that women who were denied care fell deeper into poverty and took four years to catch up to the employment levels of the women in the study who did receive an abortion. GAO’s analysis of the existing data also found that women who were denied care were less likely to be working full-time six months after the denial.
Diana Greene Foster, the author of the Turnaway Study and a MacArthur “genius grant” recipient, was hoping to continue her work by following people who sought abortions after the overturn of Roe.
But Foster was only six months into a five-year federal grant to fund the study when federal funding was terminated in March.
In a letter from the National Institutes of Health that Foster shared with The 19th at the time, she was told her research no longer aligned with agency priorities: “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.










People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated. It's an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.


– Michigan Democratic State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Scott Louser, R-Minot, talks to a colleague in the House chamber on May 1, 2025. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota lawmaker says he’ll no longer petition for a ballot measure to make the state fund 100% of the public school system after polling showed homeowners have mixed feelings about his proposal.
Property taxes assessed by local governments cover about 27% of the cost of North Dakota’s public school system for the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Department of Public Instruction. The state paid the other roughly 73%.
Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot, says the state should cover local governments’ share of public school costs. He believes this is key to broad, long-term property tax relief.
North Dakota Legislature adopts ‘historic’ property tax bill on final day of session

During the 2025 session he sponsored a bill to this end, though it was rejected in favor of another property tax package, House Bill 1176, which provides homeowners with a tax credit of up to $1,600 for tax years 2025 and 2026. The tax credit is expected to eliminate property taxes completely for a subset of homeowners for the next two years.
Louser ultimately voted for House Bill 1176, but announced at the end of the legislative session he planned to revive his proposal through a voter-initiated measure.
He said his policy would be easier to implement, cheaper and provide broader relief to property owners, since it would extend to agricultural and commercial property as opposed to just residential property.
Still, he said he supports House Bill 1176 and will be waiting to see how voters feel about the program.
“I think it deserves an opportunity to be implemented,” he said. 
Louser commissioned a survey this spring to gauge voters’ appetite for his ballot measure, though the results were inconclusive, he said.
About 49% of respondents said they would support his policy over the tax relief program established by House Bill 1176.
“I wanted to see at least a 20 point margin for support for a constitutional amendment,” he said. “It wasn’t close.”
The survey, conducted by Florida-based consulting firm Kaplan Strategies, was completed by roughly 1,000 North Dakotans, 99% of whom identified themselves as homeowners. Louser paid for the survey.
Some of the results were contradictory, which Louser said suggests respondents may not have entirely understood the policies they were being asked about.
The poll indicated many North Dakotans may be concerned about the sustainability of the residential property tax credit program implemented by House Bill 1176. About 67% of the respondents indicated they are “concerned” that the program “could result in fluctuating or reduced relief in the future” since it has to be re-authorized each legislative session.
Lawmakers made property tax relief a major priority for the 2025 legislative session after voters put a measure on the November ballot to eliminate property taxes based on assessed value. The ballot measure failed, though lawmakers said voters may be inclined to revive it if the Legislature didn’t deliver on tax relief in the future.
Former state lawmaker Rick Becker, who chaired the effort behind the failed ballot measure, said last week he doesn’t have any concrete plans to pursue another property tax amendment.
“There’s nothing on the table right now,” he said.

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
Isolated and unsure
Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
‘Lost in D.C.’
On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.










These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.


– Sheila Dessau-Ivey of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.
But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
Congressional chaos
The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
Future possibilities
Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Women Speak Out Virginia is sending 100 people out to knock on 150,000 doors in Richmond and Virginia Beach between now and late July. Their aim: influence voters to elect candidates this fall who oppose a proposed constitutional amendment to enshrine reproductive rights into Virginia’s constitution.
“As the largest pro-life voter contact program in the country, we are known for our impact on elections,” SBA Pro-Life America Virginia state director Marlene Downing said in a statement. “Our doorstep conversations change the minds of persuadable voters and energize pro-life Americans to go to the polls.” (SBA Pro-Life is a partner of Women Speak Out Virginia.)
Abortion and other reproductive health measures don’t always fall along partisan lines. Red, blue and purple states have sent reproductive rights messages in recent years with red states such as Kansas rejecting an amendment to strip residents of abortion rights and Ohio enshrining abortion rights in its constitution. Virginia’s amendment to do similarly has only advanced because of Democratic majorities in the House of Delegates and state Senate. 
It must pass again in the 2026 legislative session. From there, it would appear on statewide ballots for voters to finally approve or reject. But that depends on whether Democrats can retain their control in the House this year — where all 100 seats are up for election. A handful of competitive districts will be paramount to the amendment’s success or defeat — several of which SBA is focusing on this summer.










Our doorstep conversations change the minds of persuadable voters...


– Marlenę Downing, Virginia state director of SBA Pro-Life America


Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia director Jamie Lockart said that opponents of the amendment “see this as their last attempt to stop this.”
That’s because amending the state’s constitution — be it adding something or taking something out — is harder to do than passing a single law. But it also means that enshrined protections are unable to be undone within a single legislative session.
In the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a federal case that had protected access nationwide, states have sought restrictions and bans or placed protections in their constitutions. Other reproductive health choices like contraception or fertility treatments have been legislated on or challenged in courts. Amid this shifting landscape, Virginia is currently the least-restrictive southern state when it comes to abortion — and it’s seen a surge of out-of-state patients since the fall of Roe. 
This year, Virginia’s reproductive rights amendment will likely feature as a prominent selling point for candidates — whether they’re vowing to defend it or defeat it. 
What current law allows
Current state law allows most abortions up to around 26 weeks of pregnancy and later abortions require three physicians to attest that continuing a pregnancy would threaten the life of the parent or “irremediably impair” their physical or mental well-being. 
Later abortions make up about 1% of abortions, according to data from Kaiser Family Foundation, a health data nonprofit. About 4% of abortions in Virginia occur between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy — this is usually when severe fetal anomalies are more likely to be detected. Most abortions in Virginia happen under 13 weeks. 
A recent Pew Research Center poll noted support for abortion has remained fairly consistent in recent decades, with 62% of Americans surveyed agreeing that it should be legal in all or most cases. 
The amendment, if approved, would largely shore up Virginia’s existing protections for abortions and would remove the three physician thresholds needed for later abortions. 
Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, challenged the motion on the House floor earlier this year, calling it a “word salad” designed to “cloud the true intentions.”  He argued that lowering the doctor threshold to just one doctor removes safeguards.
“The abortion doctor can do that,” he said. Supporters of the amendment countered the change is intended to address barriers faced by rural patients.
He also accused Democrats of supporting infanticide with the amendment, and opponents of the state’s current abortion laws have argued the amendment would allow the procedure up to “the moment of birth.”
State and federal law prohibit infanticide and such accusations have been widely debunked by medical experts.
Still, SBA door-knockers are expected to focus on that message as they did in a press release announcing their campaign.
Director Downing asserted that Democrats are “determined to wipe away all limitations on abortion in Virginia” and said that they would repeal Virginia’s parental involvement laws. 
Republicans had sought changes to the amendment that could shore up existing state law regarding parental consent for minors seeking surgeries, including abortion. Democrats rejected the efforts with House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, referencing both existing law and a judicial bypass option some minors can petition for. 
“The law is the law unless the court says it’s not,” she said at the time. 
Vulnerable candidates get Planned Parenthood support
While Herring’s seat is reliably Democratic leaning, Republicans and abortion opponent groups like SBA Pro-Life have their eyes on others. Between Richmond and Virginia Beach, the canvassing efforts will target potential voters with vulnerable Democratic candidates 
Targeted contests include incumbent delegates Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, and Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, along with Democrats running in competitive districts near Richmond, Petersburg and Williamsburg.
May Nivar, is challenging Del. David Owen, R-Henrico. He secured his election by a little over 700 votes in 2023. Jessica Anderson and Kimberly Pope Adams face rematches with incumbents Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City County, and Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, the latter of which won by 53 votes last time. Meanwhile, challenger, Lindsey Dougherty will challenge Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Colonial Heights as well.
Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia plans to support the Democratic candidates through door knocking and other campaign events throughout the rest of the year. Democrats can also expect support from ReproRising Virginia, whose executive director calls “reproductive freedom” a “winning issue.”
“Our organization will be doing everything we can to elect champions statewide, but especially to the House of Delegates,” Lockhart, of Planned Parenthood, said. “We’re confident that when voters have the ability to vote on protecting their rights, they will resoundingly do so.”

The storm claimed three lives, making it the deadliest tornado to hit North Dakota since 1978. (Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)The weekend tornado that killed three people in rural Enderlin was the most deadly North Dakota has seen in nearly five decades.
While North Dakota sees an average of about 23 tornadoes a year, fatalities are rare, National Weather Service data indicates. The last tornado to claim three or more lives in the state was a July 4, 1978, storm that killed five people in Elgin. It was recorded as an F4.
Between the 1978 tornado and last weekend’s storm, North Dakota recorded four fatal tornadoes: an F2 in Renville County in 1997, an EF4 in Northwood in 2007, an EF3 in Ward County in 2010 and an EF2 in Watford City in 2018. Each of them resulted in one fatality.
Storm impact on North Dakota agriculture ‘tremendous,’ ag commissioner says

The deadliest North Dakota tornado on record took place June 20, 1957, in Fargo, an F5 that claimed 10 lives.
While the National Weather Service has yet to officially classify this weekend’s tornadoes, preliminary results suggest the storm that hit Enderlin was an EF3, according to Jacob Spender, a meteorologist for the agency’s Grand Forks Office.
The people who died in the Enderlin tornado late Friday were identified as Michael Dehn, 73, Katherine Pfaff-Dehn, 73, and Marcario Lucio, 89, according to the Cass County Sheriff’s Office.
A separate tornado that appeared south of Valley City has been preliminarily classified as a EF2, Spender said.
The Grand Forks office said Monday it has yet to determine how many tornadoes in total there were.
“We sent a flurry of different teams out to kind of assess the different damage across the area,” Spender said.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong is expected to tour the damage this week.

By early 2027, a full statue will grace the entrance to the building. (Photo: Tennessee Arts Commission)Tennessee is planning to install a bronze statue of legendary frontiersman David Crockett by fall 2026 in front of the State Capitol.
The estimated $1 million project is going through the design phase, then will face a state committee evaluation before being erected late next year, in time for the inauguration of the state’s next governor in early 2027, according to state Architect Ann McGauran. She updated the State Building Commission’s Executive Subcommittee on the schedule Monday.
The Tennessee Capitol Commission previously approved the Crockett statue project after the Edward Carmack statue in front of the Capitol along Martin Luther King Boulevard was toppled during 2020 protests that roiled the nation following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 
The statue of Carmack, who died in a 1908 shootout with political rivals, was put up in 1927. The former U.S. senator and newspaper executive who clashed with civil rights activist Ida B. Wells over his support for lynching, was considered a martyr for the prohibition movement at the time.
A bust of Crockett already sits on the second floor of the State Capitol, signifying his importance in the history of Tennessee, where he was born in the eastern part of the state and gained a reputation as a hunter, fighter and story teller before serving in the state legislature and Congress.
Crockett joined the Texas fight for independence from Mexico and died at the Alamo in 1836.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.












Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance




Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

A new report from researchers at the national Commonwealth Fund finds that North Carolina has made enormous strides in assuring that people receive the right health care at the right time and are able to avoid hospital stays and emergency room visits by receiving timely care.
The percentage of North Carolina adults who reported that there was a time in the previous year that they didn’t go to the doctor when they needed to because they couldn’t afford it dropped by almost half between 2013 and 2023.
The main reasons for the progress – enactment of the federal Affordable Care Act and other improvements to the Medicaid insurance program.
Unfortunately, the report also notes that much, if not all, of this progress is placed in jeopardy by the Republican mega-bill making its way through Congress that would slash Medicaid funding and enact new and bureaucratic work requirements.
The bottom line: Now is the time to build on past success in improving health care access, not backtrack. Senators Tills and Budd should oppose the proposed cuts.

But the bad blood between the two countries isn’t new: The U.S. and Iran have been in conflict for decades – at least since the U.S. helped overthrow a democracy-minded prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, in August 1953. The U.S. then supported the long, repressive reign of the Shah of Iran, whose security services brutalized Iranian citizens for decades.
The two countries have been particularly hostile to each other since Iranian students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979, resulting in economic sanctions and the severing of formal diplomatic relations between the nations.

Since 1984, the U.S. State Department has listed Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” alleging the Iranian government provides terrorists with training, money and weapons.
Some of the major events in U.S.-Iran relations highlight the differences between the nations’ views, but others arguably presented real opportunities for reconciliation.
 1953: US overthrows Mossadegh

In 1951, the Iranian Parliament chose a new prime minister, Mossadegh, who then led lawmakers to vote in favor of taking over the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, expelling the company’s British owners and saying theywanted to turn oil profits into investments in the Iranian people. The U.S. feared disruption in the global oil supply and worried about Iran falling prey to Soviet influence. The British feared the loss of cheap Iranian oil.
President Dwight Eisenhower decided it was best for the U.S. and the U.K. to get rid of Mossadegh. Operation Ajax, a joint CIA-British operation, convinced the Shah of Iran, the country’s monarch, to dismiss Mossadegh and drive him from office by force. Mossadegh was replaced by a much more Western-friendly prime minister, handpicked by the CIA.

 1979: Revolutionaries oust the shah, take hostages

After more than 25 years of relative stability in U.S.-Iran relations, the Iranian public had grown unhappy with the social and economic conditions that developed under the dictatorial rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
Pahlavi enriched himself and used American aid to fund the military while many Iranians lived in poverty. Dissent was often violently quashed by SAVAK, the shah’s security service. In January 1979, the shah left Iran, ostensibly to seek cancer treatment. Two weeks later, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from exile in Iraq and led a drive to abolish the monarchy and proclaim an Islamic government.

In October 1979, President Jimmy Carter agreed to allow the shah to come to the U.S. to seek advanced medical treatment. Outraged Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, taking 52 Americans hostage. That convinced Carter to sever U.S. diplomatic relations with Iran on April 7, 1980.
Two weeks later, the U.S. military launched a mission to rescue the hostages, but it failed, with aircraft crashes killing eight U.S. servicemembers.
The shah died in Egypt in July 1980, but the hostages weren’t released until Jan. 20, 1981, after 444 days of captivity.

 1980-1988: U.S. tacitly sides with Iraq

In September 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, an escalation of the two countries’ regional rivalry and religious differences: Iraq was governed by Sunni Muslims but had a Shia Muslim majority population; Iran was led and populated mostly by Shiites.
The U.S. was concerned that the conflict would limit the flow of Middle Eastern oil and wanted to ensure the conflict didn’t affect its close ally, Saudi Arabia.
The U.S. supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in his fight against the anti-American Iranian regime. As a result, the U.S. mostly turned a blind eye toward Iraq’s use of chemical weapons against Iran.
U.S. officials moderated their usual opposition to those illegal and inhumane weapons because the U.S. State Department did not “wish to play into Iran’s hands by fueling its propaganda against Iraq.” In 1988, the war ended in a stalemate. More than 500,000 military and 100,000 civilians died.
 1981-1986: US secretly sells weapons to Iran

The U.S. imposed an arms embargo after Iran was designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984. That left the Iranian military, in the middle of its war with Iraq, desperate for weapons and aircraft and vehicle parts to keep fighting.
The Reagan administration decided that the embargo would likely push Iran to seek support from the Soviet Union, the U.S.’s Cold War rival. Rather than formally end the embargo, U.S. officials agreed to secretly sell weapons to Iran starting in 1981.
The last shipment, of anti-tank missiles, was in October 1986. In November 1986, a Lebanese magazine exposed the deal. That revelation sparked the Iran-Contra scandal in the U.S., with Reagan’s officials found to have collected money from Iran for the weapons and illegally sent those funds to anti-socialist rebels – the Contras – in Nicaragua.

 1988: U.S. Navy shoots down Iran Air flight 655

On the morning of July 8, 1988, the USS Vincennes, a guided missile cruiser patrolling in the international waters of the Persian Gulf, entered Iranian territorial waters while in a skirmish with Iranian gunboats.
Either during or just after that exchange of gunfire, the Vincennes crew mistook a passing civilian Airbus passenger jet for an Iranian F-14 fighter. They shot it down, killing all 290 people aboard.
The U.S. called it a “tragic and regrettable accident,” but Iran believed the plane’s downing was intentional. In 1996, the U.S. agreed to pay US$131.8 million in compensation to Iran.
 1997-1998: The U.S. seeks contact

In August 1997, a moderate reformer, Mohammad Khatami, won Iran’s presidential election.
U.S. President Bill Clinton sensed an opportunity. He sent a message to Tehran through the Swiss ambassador there, proposing direct government-to-government talks.
Shortly thereafter, in early January 1998, Khatami gave an interview to CNN in which he expressed “respect for the great American people,” denounced terrorism and recommended an “exchange of professors, writers, scholars, artists, journalists and tourists” between the United States and Iran.
However, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei didn’t agree, so not much came of the mutual overtures as Clinton’s time in office came to an end.
In his 2002 State of the Union address, President George W. Bush characterized Iran, Iraq and North Korea as constituting an “Axis of Evil” supporting terrorism and pursuing weapons of mass destruction, straining relations even further.

 2002: Iran’s nuclear program raises alarm

In August 2002, an exiled rebel group announced that Iran had been secretly working on nuclear weapons at two installations that had not previously been publicly revealed.
That was a violation of the terms of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Iran had signed, requiring countries to disclose their nuclear-related facilities to international inspectors.
One of those formerly secret locations, Natanz, housed centrifuges for enriching uranium, which could be used in civilian nuclear reactors or enriched further for weapons.
Starting in roughly 2005, U.S. and Israeli government cyberattackers together reportedly targeted the Natanz centrifuges with a custom-made piece of malicious software that became known as Stuxnet.
That effort, which slowed down Iran’s nuclear program was one of many U.S. and international attempts – mostly unsuccessful – to curtail Iran’s progress toward building a nuclear bomb.
 2003: Iran writes to Bush administration

In May 2003, senior Iranian officials quietly contacted the State Department through the Swiss embassy in Iran, seeking “a dialogue ‘in mutual respect,’” addressing four big issues: nuclear weapons, terrorism, Palestinian resistance and stability in Iraq.
Hardliners in the Bush administration weren’t interested in any major reconciliation, though Secretary of State Colin Powell favored dialogue and other officials had met with Iran about al-Qaida.
When Iranian hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president of Iran in 2005, the opportunity died. The following year, Ahmadinejad made his own overture to Washington in an 18-page letter to President Bush. The letter was widely dismissed; a senior State Department official told me in profane terms that it amounted to nothing.

 2015: Iran nuclear deal signed

After a decade of unsuccessful attempts to rein in Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the Obama administration undertook a direct diplomatic approach beginning in 2013.
Two years of secret, direct negotiations initially bilaterally between the U.S. and Iran and later with other nuclear powers culminated in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, often called the Iran nuclear deal.
Iran, the U.S., China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom signed the deal in 2015. It severely limited Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium and mandated that international inspectors monitor and enforce Iran’s compliance with the agreement.
In return, Iran was granted relief from international and U.S. economic sanctions. Though the inspectors regularly certified that Iran was abiding by the agreement’s terms, President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in May 2018.
 2020: U.S. drones kill Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani


On Jan. 3, 2020, an American drone fired a missile that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Analysts considered Soleimani the second most powerful man in Iran, after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
At the time, the Trump administration asserted that Soleimani was directing an imminent attack against U.S. assets in the region, but officials have not provided clear evidence to support that claim.
Iran responded by launching ballistic missiles that hit two American bases in Iraq.
 2023: The Oct. 7 attacks on Israel

Hamas’ brazen attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, provoked a fearsome militarized response from Israel that continues today and served to severely weaken Iran’s proxies in the region, especially Hamas – the perpetrator of the attacks – and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 2025: Trump 2.0 and Iran

Trump saw an opportunity to forge a new nuclear deal with Iran and to pursue other business deals with Tehran. Once inaugurated for his second term, Trump appointed Steve Witkoff, a real estate investor who is the president’s friend, to serve as special envoy for the Middle East and to lead negotiations.
Negotiations for a nuclear deal between Washington and Tehran began in April, but the countries did not reach a deal. They were planning a new round of talks when Israel struck Iran with a series of airstrikes on June 13, forcing the White House to reconsider is position.
On June 22, in the early morning hours, the U.S. chose to act decisively in an attempt to cripple Iran’s nuclear capacity, bombing three nuclear sites and causing what Pentagon officials called “severe damage.” Iran vowed to retaliate.

(NPS/Public domain)Spring came early this year on the mountain slopes near Crested Butte. David Inouye has monitored the blooming of wildflowers there during the last 55 years. This was not a record year, he reported in May, but it was remarkably different from just a few decades ago.
“Thirty years ago, flowering didn’t start until the first week of June,” reported Inouye, who studies the timing of periodic biological events in plants and animals, a discipline called phenology. By late April this year, seven species of wildflowers had blooms on the slopes of the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory.
More wildflowers earlier in spring. What’s not to like about that?

In Paonia this year, where Inouye lives, Apricot trees flowered in mid-March. Later frosts killed this year’s crop. That, he says, is one harm to earlier spring.
Early springs produced by rising temperatures also have long-term consequences. In 2005, when I first started writing about climate change, I traveled to the outdoor laboratory at Gothic to see an experiment then underway. John Harte, a scientist from Berkeley, had mounted electric heaters over plots to approximate future temperature increases. How would this change vegetation over time? Would sagebrush eventually replace the wildflowers?
The answer is complex but comes down to one word: yes. We can expect more sagebrush and fewer wildflowers on south-facing hillsides at 9,500 feet in elevation. This, Inouye pointed out, will take time. “Almost all the wildflowers here are long-lived perennials, so change doesn’t happen rapidly. Even if they stop making seeds, some of those individual plants will still live for decades,” said Inouye, who lives in Paonia but remains on the faculty of the University of Maryland.
“It takes long-term study to document changes to the high-altitude environment,” he added. “To some degree that longevity provides a buffer to the ongoing climate changes, especially if we can succeed in reversing them in the foreseeable future.”
An early spring was observed far beyond Colorado’s mountain slopes. A U.S. Geological Survey website on June 6 showed a spring leaf index two and three weeks early across broad bands of the United States, including Colorado.
Once again, so what? In most places, people prefer summer to winter. Besides, isn’t this story about earlier spring getting old? One scientist I queried said yet another story about early springs would induce yawns unless I had a new angle, like a spike in electricity demand for air conditioning during April.
Brad Udall delivered a strong rejoinder at a recent Colorado River conference. “Hold on to your seats,” he told his audience at the University of Colorado’s Getches-Wilkinson Center, “because I’m going to make you uncomfortable.”
The world, explained Udall, a water and climate research scientist at the Colorado Water Institute, is on track for warming of 9 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. “This far exceeds anything agreed to by the 2015 Paris Climate Accords. And frankly, it terrifies scientists.”
Over land, the temperature increase will be even greater than the global average. “That’s a world unlike anything we currently know, and it’s going to challenge us all on every front.”
Nearly all scientists agree that heat-trapping greenhouse gases are responsible for our predicament. Emissions have risen 60% during the last 35 years. “What we’re witnessing is a monumental failure of both capitalism and governance,” he said.
Why sound the climate change siren at a Colorado River conference? Because water availability in the Colorado River Basin is inextricably linked to rising temperatures. Drought can ease. Aridification, the result of rising temperatures, will not.
The seven states who share the river now struggle over how to share this shrinking river. The 1922 compact assumed 20 million acre-feet. Flows this century have averaged about 20% less.
“I’m now convinced that we need to plan for the worst possible climate future, and that’s somewhere around 10 million acre-feet runoff,” said Udall. “But what it also means is taking a hard look at every existing agreement in the river. It either breaks them or substantially modifies them.”
A hopeless situation? Udall warned against despair. “There’s a term called the pessimism aversion trap. It’s the tendency look the other way when confronted with dark realities,” he explained. Don’t go there, he said. “We still control our destiny, even if the solutions seem daunting.”
And finally, his plea: “I plead with you to get serious about figuring out how to reduce the emissions of your organization and even your own personal emissions. I agree that individual actions aren’t going to solve this, but they send a really strong signal to everyone around us.”

For weeks now, Senate and House Republican leaders have publicly stated that they were far from an agreement on a state budget for the new fiscal year that commences next Tuesday, July 1 – particularly with respect to tax policy. And in recent days, it seems the two sides have concluded that they’d just as soon live with the budget that’s already in place as spend the dog days of summer mired in a public stalemate. State law provides that the current budget will continue absent passage of a new one.
The unveiling of what some are calling a “mini-budget” by Senate leaders Monday evening along with the quick passage of a new Hurricane Helene relief package were the latest signals that Republican legislators believe they’ve reached a point of diminishing political returns and are ready to vacate the capital city – perhaps even for the year.
If the legislature really does call it a year, it will mark a notable departure from the pattern of many of the last several years of GOP rule in which sessions have lingered into the fall (and in a few cases, the holiday season) and a return to the pattern that generally prevailed in the late 20th Century in which lawmakers usually wrapped up their sessions in or around the start of the fiscal year.
And it will also mark a sudden end to a session in which accomplishments likely to make a marked improvement in the lives of average North Carolinians have been notably few and far between.
There will undoubtedly be a raft of additional bills passed and sent to the Governor during the session’s waning days and hours, but at this point, it’s hard to identify much that will be worth bragging about when things have wrapped.
Aside from Helene relief and a relative handful of other lower-profile measures, lawmakers have largely avoided the big challenges that confront the state – things like its underfunded and understaffed public schools, state employee shortages in several core state agencies like prisons, mental health facilities and DMV offices, rising health insurance rates for state employees, a chronic lack of affordable housing and a steady rise in homelessness, a large and growing list of unaddressed environmental challenges, a rising tide of gun violence, and a growing risk of significant revenue shortfalls in years to come.
Instead, Republican leaders have devoted significant and wasteful attention to right-wing culture war priorities, like attacking the rights of immigrants and transgender people, promoting public school book bans and censorship, attempting to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in state government, further weakening state gun laws, and pulling back from a previously negotiated law that was designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions from electric utilities.
This provocative pattern was on full display last week when Senators chose the Juneteenth holiday, of all days – a date on which even the state House conducted no business at all – to hold a lengthy floor session and multiple busy committee hearings, one of which was headlined by the bill to ban DEI.
How many of the culture war broadsides will actually find their way into state law, however, remains extremely uncertain at this point. Gov. Josh Stein issued the first three vetoes of his administration last week on a pair of bills designed to spur immigrant deportations and another measure that would allow anyone 18 and older to carry a loaded, concealed firearm without a permit, and it remains unclear if Republicans will be able to command the supermajorities they will need in both houses to override them. Only one of the bills – House Bill 318 — is scheduled for an override vote in the House thus far.
If lawmakers do head out of town this week, they will have to arrange to return to Raleigh at some later date to consider any other vetoes Stein might issue after they depart.
And if Stein and his allies manage to figure a way to preserve most or all of the vetoes he ends up issuing, that fact, in combination with the GOP failure to pass a new and comprehensive budget chockful of conservative pet projects and initiatives, will mark a victory of sorts for Democrats and a validation of their electoral success last fall in narrowly breaking the Republican supermajority in the House.
In short, as the end of the 2025 legislative session beckons, Republicans appear to be aware they’ve done about all they can for now, while Democrats are likely feeling that they could have done a lot worse.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240307_103841-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-24 05:58:19.819563

Show of hands: who loves paying the yearly tax on your personal automobiles?
Don’t be shy. Raise those hands. Anybody?
Virginia car tax credit hits dead end before Senate panel

As Virginians, it’s perhaps our most galling duty: paying hundreds of bucks (thousands for folks with bougie rides) to your city, county or town government for the responsibility of owning a depreciating asset you pay through the nose to buy, insure, fuel and maintain.
According to the Tax Foundation, Virginia is among 27 states and the District of Columbia where tangible personal property taxes are assessed. Fourteen states broadly exempt personal property from taxes; 10 allow de minimis exemptions.
Our car tax is a much-reviled but long-lived creature. Both gubernatorial candidates, Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, have pledged to tame — if not slay — this dragon if elected governor.
Twenty-eight summers ago, a candidate for governor and his team of advisers identified and harnessed this resentment in arguably the most effective three-word campaign mantra in Virginia history: “NO CAR TAX!”
That was Jim Gilmore, a Republican whose 1997 gubernatorial campaign realized somewhat by accident that the issue was lightning in a bottle during a rally in Roanoke.
“I came off the stage in Roanoke and said, ‘What was that?’” Gilmore said in an interview Monday, describing the crowd’s ovation to his line about ending the hated tax. “The roar was unearthly.”

He and his campaign brain trust — Boyd Marcus, Ray Allen and Steve Horton — knew they were onto something. They had already staked out positions supporting elevated state educational standards and hiring more teachers in addition to lowering taxes. The pledge to 86 the tax, however, stuck like Velcro and dominated the 1997 campaign.
It was so potent that Gilmore’s Democratic opponent that year, Lt. Gov. Don Beyer, went from deriding it as a political parlor trick to offering his own scaled-down “me too” car tax reduction plan in the dying days of his campaign.
Gilmore cruised to a 13-percentage point victory and did something unprecedented: led the Republican Party to its first sweep of Virginia’s three statewide executive branch offices. The late John H. Hager of Richmond was elected lieutenant governor and state Sen. Mark L. Earley of Chesapeake was elected attorney general.
Gilmore’s mandate was convincing enough that the General Assembly — with Democrats clinging to tenuous majorities — passed his plan as a full, five-year phaseout of the tax on the first $20,000 of a car’s value beginning with a 12.5% cut in 1998. The state reimbursed local governments for their lost revenues with direct payments from the state’s general fund, collected largely from income and sales taxes.
Things went well for three years, but time, the economy and global events were not on Gilmore’s side, and they validated Beyer’s admonitions. By 2000, an irrationally exuberant economy built on an overheated, nascent online services industry was collapsing on itself, hitting Washington’s tech-heavy Northern Virginia suburbs — the commonwealth’s economic mainstay — particularly hard. It showed up in Virginia’s general tax collections beginning in fiscal year 2001.










The women running for governor both say they’re ready to end Virginia’s car tax, at long last. Whoever wins, she better show up with a convincing political mandate and a lot of really smart advisers. She must be ready to work insane hours and endure ceaseless frustrations and efforts to sabotage this intricate, delicate endeavor.


– Bob Lewis, Virginia Mercury columnist


In the 12-month budget year that began July 1, 2000, and lasted midway through Gilmore’s final year in office, general fund collections fell $253 million (-2%) below the revenue estimate on which state spending was predicated. By fiscal year 2002, the shortfall ballooned to $1.26 billion (-12%) below the forecast, causing alarm across Capitol Square, particularly within the GOP-led Senate Finance Committee where Democrats and Republicans coalesced against Gilmore’s phaseout.
Virginia could no longer afford to play shell games with local and state revenue without endangering core obligations including public education, public health and public safety. In January 2002, Gilmore turned the Executive Mansion over to Democrat Mark Warner. Weeks later, the General Assembly froze car-tax reimbursement at 70%. In 2004, in a tax restructuring package Warner muscled through a balky GOP legislature, Virginia capped its total car tax reimbursement at $950 million annually starting in tax year 2006 and unchanged since.
Two decades later, the issue simmers anew thanks to soaring post-pandemic car valuations that are inflating car tax bills even on older vehicles. The women running for governor both say they’re ready to end Virginia’s car tax, at long last. 
Whoever wins, she better show up with a convincing political mandate and a lot of really smart advisers. She must be ready to work insane hours and endure ceaseless frustrations and efforts to sabotage this intricate, delicate endeavor.
Says who? Says Gilmore, the OG of car tax relief, who hopes the next governor completes what he started.
“Once you get into the technicalities of doing it, it’s extremely difficult because it is not a state tax. It is a local tax. And that is a problem that has to be solved,” he said.
Yes it is, and the rates are all over the place from county to county, city to city, town to town and even special taxing districts within many of those jurisdictions. For instance, an analysis of personal property tax rates for 2023 shows that the median county rate was $3.54 per $100 of assessed value, but rates that year ranged from $9 in Pittsylvania County to 55 cents in Bath County. Toss in the fact that some localities offer waivers for  elderly, low-income and disabled residents and you can see how hard finding an equitable formula for such a crazy quilt of tax policies would be.
Gilmore said experience taught him that the solution is not to nibble around the edges by scaling back the tax on a prescribed range of valuation then repaying localities.
“I’ll tell you now, in the fullness of time, that if I’d had a second term, we would have completely phased it out, but the question is ‘What then?’” he said. “Upon years of reflection … we would then have had to do a genuine tax reform.”
In other words, wipe the personal property tax off the books. That would require broadening other revenue sources such as real estate or local option sales taxes and likely direct appropriations from the General Assembly.
That wouldn’t be cheap. According to the Auditor of Public Accounts’ 2024 “Comparative Report on Local Government Revenues and Expenditures,” the personal property tax generated $3.95 billion for localities during the 12 months that ended last June 30. That is the second largest local revenue source behind real estate taxes which generated $14.2 billion in local revenue in the same span.
If Earle-Sears and Spanberger are serious about their pledge, perhaps they should contact two primary stakeholders: the VML and the Virginia Association of Counties. Joe Flores, VML’s fiscal policy director, said Spanberger’s team recently reached out to his organization about the tax.
“…[R]eplacing a primary revenue source for counties, cities and towns, at a time when there remains uncertainty about the general fund revenue outlook and the federal government is on the verge of shoving costs onto state and local governments, is likely to prove exceedingly difficult,” Flores said.
“It is worrisome that these proposals have gained political momentum in the press with Virginia facing future reductions in Medicaid, SNAP, and other federal grants because of the federal reconciliation bills proposed in each house of Congress,” said Dean Lynch, VaCO’s executive director. “But we welcome future discussions with either candidate on the best ways to supplant local revenues with needed state funding.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers are returning Tuesday to decide the fate of nearly 300 bills that are still awaiting funding. 
In total, these bills would cost about $2.5 billion over the next two years. A bill to increase the cost-of-living adjustments for state employee pensions that is not expected to pass accounts for $1.6 billion of that.
After Gov. Janet Mills signed the budget addition into law on Monday, there is about $7 million left in the general fund that can be allocated for these measures, which were placed on the so-called appropriations table because they require funding.
The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, which sets the budget, manages this table. The committee on Tuesday is scheduled to “run the table,” which involves deciding which proposals to fund with the remaining unappropriated money and at what amount. Any bills that the committee decides to leave on the table will die. 
Last year, less than 10% of bills placed on the appropriations table ultimately became law. 
Among the proposals currently on the table are two bills related to firearm regulation. 
LD 1126, as passed in amended form, would require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns that are assembled at home or those made with a 3D printer. It would also prohibit undetectable firearms, meaning those that can’t be spotted with a metal detector. LD 1867 would prohibit financial institutions and merchants from using firearm codes to track purchases. 
Two other bills on the table seek to ensure the already required teachings of Wabanaki and African American studies are effectively taught in Maine schools. Another bill awaiting funding is a bipartisan compromise to establish a task force to suggest reforms to the real estate property tax. 
A few of the bills on the table have already been incorporated into the budget that Mills signed into law on Monday, including an initiative to help mitigate the fact that the Older Americans Act is no longer funded by the federal government and an act to add certain mental health workers under the 1998 Special Plan for Retirement. These measures will likely remain “on the table” upon adjournment because they’ve been funded an alternative way. 
Any bills the appropriations committee decides to vote off the table will still need approval again by the full Legislature, which is slated to reconvene on Wednesday.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)With no new state budget in sight, a key Senate committee approved a bill Monday evening authorizing new spending in select areas across state government after June 30.
Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), a chief budget writer, said the rewrite of House Bill 125 is not a “mini-budget,” but is a “needs to” bill intended to accomplish goals such as keeping capital projects going and covering increased community college enrollment.
The House and Senate passed different GOP-written budget proposals this session and have been unable to bridge their significant differences. With the state fiscal year ending June 30, legislators plan to begin a long break from General Assembly work at the end of the week and allow the state head into the next fiscal year without a new comprehensive budget.
State law allows spending to continue at current levels even without a new budget, so government will continue running when the next budget year begins July 1. The bill the Senate budget committee approved Monday afternoon includes money for new items for the next two years.
“We have had conversations with House leadership” about the bill, Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters Monday night.
The bill will go to the House after the Senate passes it. Berger said that Thursday will likely be the last day of work before legislators take their break.
One of the biggest chunks of money in the bill is $252 million in economic development funds for the JetZero project in Guilford County. The start-up plane manufacturer announced earlier this month that it will invest $4.7 billion in a Piedmont Triad International Airport facility and create 14,560 jobs by 2063. 
The bill provides $30 million for the Healthy Opportunities Pilot to continue for another year. The state Department of Health and Human Services has been pushing hard to have this project continue past June 30. DHHS launched Healthy Opportunities in three mostly rural regions of the state in 2022. It aims to lower health care costs and improve the health of Medicaid enrollees by helping them secure food, transportation, and housing, and help those experiencing interpersonal violence. 
The bill funds enrollment growth at K-12 public schools and the UNC system, as well for community colleges. 
The bill includes $700,000 for the Environmental Management Commission to hire its own staff. 
State Auditor Dave Boliek would receive $6 million a year for two years to pay for 45 positions in the new Division of Accountability, Value, and Efficiency. The division would recommend cuts to government offices or jobs, NC Newsline reported.
The bill would allow spending of $4.1 million over two years to hire a total of 61 driver’s license examiners at the DMV.
In the appropriations committee, Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange) noted the current 68% job vacancy rate at the DMV and questioned whether the problem is not having enough positions. 
Sen. Mike Lee (R-New Hanover), said he’s been in touch with Paul Tine, the new DMV commissioner. 
“I’ll be honest with you, I don’t have all the answers on how to fix the DMV,” said Lee, a budget committee chairman. “I don’t know if anyone does. The request was for additional positions, so that’s what this does.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_8592-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 05:58:19.819563

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Screenshot/Arkansas Legislature)Arkansas lawmakers on Monday questioned the head of State Police’s Crimes Against Children Division about the process for deciding which reports to the Child Abuse Hotline to investigate.
The hotline accepted 9,042 of the 16,480 reports it received from Jan. 1 to March 31 of this year, according to a quarterly report CACD commander Maj. Jeffrey Drew presented to the Legislature’s Joint Children and Youth Committee. 
The Crimes Against Children Division took on 1,593 of those reports while the Department of Human Services’ Division of Children and Family Services took on the other 7,449.
Law enforcement takes multiple allegations against the same person into account when deciding whether to investigate a report of child maltreatment, Drew said in response to questions from Rep. Jeff Wardlaw, R-Hermitage, and committee co-chair Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett.
“If we have a call that comes in on Person A again, and we look at that history and say, ‘We’ve got some stuff going on here,’ maybe we need to go ahead and accept this one and at least get an investigator out to take care of it, instead of it ending there at the hotline,” Drew said.
Wardlaw asked Drew and DCFS Director Tiffany Wright how many reports per county the hotline did not accept. Wright said she would provide the committee later with the requested data on “screened out” reports.
Wardlaw said he had hoped the data was already available, and he added that he was frustrated by an instance in his South Arkansas district in which a report of child maltreatment was “screened out” that should not have been.
He told Wright during a meeting of the same joint committee last month that he was disappointed in the apparent shortage of foster care caseworkers in his home of Bradley County, calling it a “neglect” of his constituency.
Staffing struggles continue for Arkansas foster care system

 
Many reports to the child abuse hotline result in foster care cases, and the Division of Child and Family Services has consistently reported to lawmakers that its foster care management system is short-staffed.
The hotline received 57,854 calls between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024, of which 24,244 were accepted for investigation, according to a DCFS report Wright presented Monday — 5,185 of those investigations found the reports to be true, and 408 appeals led to 82 investigations being overturned, the report states.
The Children and Youth Committee also heard an annual report Monday from the state’s Infant and Child Death Review (ICDR) Program at Arkansas Children’s Hospital that said more than half of the deaths from unnatural causes among Arkansas children in 2022 were deemed accidental.
The review committee’s reports are by law roughly two years behind. For example, the panel reviewed 2022 deaths between July 2023 and October 2024, according to its report.
The state child death advisory panel reviewed the causes and circumstances of 172 of the 453 deaths among Arkansans under 18 years old in 2022, panelists told the Joint Children and Youth Committee while presenting the program’s annual report.
The remaining 281 child deaths were either under investigation by law enforcement or determined to be of natural causes during the period of review, said Kevin Cleghorn, president of the Arkansas Coroners’ Association and a member of the ICDR panel.
Of the 172 unnatural deaths, the panel recorded 87 as accidental, 13 as suicides and nine as homicides, with the causes of all three kinds of deaths including drowning, firearms, overdoses and asphyxia, according to the report.
Twenty-six of the accidental deaths were caused by motor vehicles.
“Children aged 10-17 accounted for the majority of these deaths, and were most often driving the vehicle,” the report states. “Safety restraints, including seatbelts, boosters and car seats, were not used in more than half of the cases.”

EXHIBIT E - ICDR FY25 Annual Report 
The review panel’s report labeled the remaining 63 child deaths undetermined, including 54 infants who died of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID).
“Of these, 66% died co-sleeping in an adult bed with one or more adult (an increase from 47% the previous year), and 54% were placed on their side or stomach to sleep,” the report states. 
The panel issued a list of recommendations to reduce child deaths, many of which involved bolstering parents’ education and resources, such as safe sleep practices to prevent SUID and free or low-cost swimming lessons to prevent drowning.
Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, said the most concerning statistic in the report was the near-doubling of Arkansas children who accidentally drowned, from 11 in 2021 to 19 in 2022. She said she plans to “work and see what we can do with a public-private partnership” to ensure children learn to swim.

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire lawmakers are moving ahead on a slew of bills to tighten voting procedures, with Republicans arguing that stricter processes are necessary for election security.
After a series of negotiations between the House and Senate last week, Republicans in both bodies are pushing forward bills to require more documentation for absentee voters and to mandate annual reviews of the voter checklists, rather than the current once-a-decade reviews. 
The bills are not guaranteed to pass; they must all clear final votes in the House and Senate on Thursday before they can head to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk. 
But they continue a multi-year effort by Republicans to add new verification processes to voting that supporters say is important for election integrity but that critics say create high hurdles.
Here’s a look at what’s moving ahead.
A once-a-year voter review
Currently, municipal election officials known as “supervisors of the checklist” are required to maintain a list of registered voters for each town or polling ward — lists that determine whether someone is eligible to vote there. 
Every year, as supervisors receive death certificates, moving notices, or other new information, they must adjust the rolls to remove those voters.
But once a decade, in the year ending in “1,” such as 2011 and 2021, the supervisors undertake a more comprehensive review. They look at every voter on the list; if the voter has not voted in an election within the last four years, and the town or city has no other information, they must send out letters to that resident’s address to verify that they still live there. Those who do not respond or are found ineligible are removed from the list and must re-register.
Senate Bill 221, as amended by House and Senate negotiators last week, would require that comprehensive process to be held annually, rather than once a decade.
The final version of the bill echoes an earlier bill, House Bill 274, which the Senate voted down in May. 
House Republican supporters say the 10-year process is not sufficient to keep the voter rolls up to date, noting that nearly 250,000 voters were taken off the rolls in the latest 2021 voter roll review. 
“This verification looks to remove voters who have not voted in a number of elections or have moved but did not inform the state or have died,” said Rep. Robert Wherry, speaking on HB 274. 
Supporters say an annual process would make the rolls more dependable, and that the continual update would reduce the workload for election officials in any one year.
But the New Hampshire Municipal Association is opposed to the bill, arguing it will create too high a workload for supervisors of the checklist, who are elected to seven-year terms but are volunteers. 
“We understand, OK, the 10 years seemingly being too long, but we think one year is going to be too short of a period — too short of a turnover every time,” said Sarah Burke Cohen, a legislative advocate for the association, in an interview. 
Burke Cohen said the once-a-decade period is already exhausting for many supervisors, and that the annual requirement could make it hard to attract people to run for the position.
Olivia Zink, executive director of Open Democracy, also warned that the annual comprehensive reviews could create headaches for voters who are mistakenly removed. 
“You could have a supervisor of the checklist … that just took somebody off the list that shouldn’t have been removed, and then the burden is now on the voter to register to vote,” she said.
The new bill addresses that concern by increasing the “grace period” in the law — the period before the review in which a voter must have voted in at least one election in order to stay on the rolls — from four years to five years. That change means if a review were carried out in 2025 and a voter had last voted in the 2020 election, the voter could stay on. 
The newly amended SB 221 requires the Secretary of State’s Office to create “any forms necessary” to allow that re-registration; some supporters say that that form could allow for a streamlined process for voters who were wrongly purged to restore their registration. 
And under the bill, a voter could be removed from the rolls only if town election officials had given them warning. The bill requires the supervisor of the checklist of the voter’s last known address to send a notice to that address at least 30 days before the election to tell the voter to re-register.
Susan Moore, a supervisor of the checklist in Franconia, which has around 800 voters, says the annual review would not pose a major burden for a small town such as hers.
“If we were in one of the cities like Concord or Manchester or Bedford or Nashua, it’s a whole lot more work, because they have a lot more happening,” she said in an interview. 
Absentee ballot requirements move forward
House and Senate Republicans came to agreements last week on a number of other bills that would tighten the voting process.
Committee of conference representatives agreed to the House’s version of Senate Bill 287, which would require people interested in voting absentee to either show up to town offices in person or to mail a notarized application.
And negotiators are moving forward with the House’s version of Senate Bill 218, which would mandate that those same people provide documentary proof of their citizenship when mailing in an absentee ballot, and to do so with a witness’s signature. 
And the two chambers agreed to the Senate’s version of House Bill 67, which would require that all cities, towns, and school districts have at least one accessible voting machine available during local elections, and that they enter into an agreement with the Secretary of State’s Office to borrow them. The Secretary of State’s Office already provides those machines in elections with federal candidates, per federal law, but this law would apply to town meetings and municipal elections, too. Under the final version of HB 67, towns and cities would be responsible for the costs to program the machines for local ballots, but not for the machines themselves.
But the chambers also agreed to House Bill 613, which would create a carve-out option for cities and town officials that do not believe they need to provide accessible voting machines. Under that agreement, a municipality may post a notice on its website at least three months before the election that it is not planning to offer the accessible machines unless someone submits a written request that they do so. That written request would need to be received at least 60 days before the election, should the municipality choose to pass the notice.
Disability rights advocates have spoken against HB 613, raising concerns that a person with disabilities could move into such a town within 60 days of an election and would not be able to use an accessible machine. But Sen. James Gray has said small towns in the North Country requested the bill, citing the cost of programming the machines and the potential that no voter would use them.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/votingchecklist-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 05:58:19.819563
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT loses $20M as Trump cuts digital equity programs,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/24/ct-digital-equity-broadband-trump/,CT libraries lost out after the federal government changed programs that sought to close inequities in internet access and digital know-how.,"Employees at the Hartford Public Library were overjoyed early this year when they learned they’d be receiving $50,000 to help expand digital literacy and skills in the region.
Staffers immediately got to work on a pilot program, using the money to support a “Community Digital Literacy Pilot” to help residents navigate the internet and use devices like smartphones and laptops. This spring, the library system hired a program manager and three part-time digital navigators — who provide technical assistance with the internet — to hold office hours and teach skills classes in English and Spanish. Posters and flyers were finalized, laptops were purchased, and a marketing campaign was expected to launch in late May.
Library leaders knew they were addressing a significant need — one felt not only in cities like Hartford but in communities across Connecticut. According to state research, while roughly 73% of people in Connecticut have access to internet-capable devices, just 64% have the skills needed to use those devices. Advocates hoped programs like the one planned in Hartford would go a long way in closing that gap. 
Those hopes were dashed in May when President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to announce he was cutting funding for the Digital Equity Act, a Biden-era federal grant program that supported the Hartford library pilot and other projects in states across the country.

The president called the program “illegal,” adding that it was “racist” for seeking to teach digital skills and improve internet access in minority communities. Other vulnerable populations included in the program — rural populations, veterans and low-income households — went unmentioned.
On May 9, one day later, the administration sent a formal letter to every state, officially terminating the $2.75 billion grant program.
Just like that, the money for the Hartford Public Library program was gone.
“We had our toe in the water,” said Bonnie Solberg, the director of public services for Hartford Public Library. “And then the money got pulled.”
In recent weeks, the federal government has made sweeping changes to Biden-era programs that sought to close persistent inequities in internet access and digital knowledge. The changes have put the futures of several federal broadband initiatives in jeopardy, including efforts to expand internet connectivity and make access more affordable.
The Digital Equity Act was cut completely, pulling a vital funding source out of the biggest effort to improve the digital skills of vulnerable communities in American history.
That loss, state and national advocates told The Connecticut Mirror, will not completely end efforts to close digital divides in the state. But it will force a change in strategy, requiring organizations to find new approaches to the problem just as they were closing in on solutions.
“When you constrain the funding, you constrain the timeline and the impact,” said Doug Casey, executive director of the Connecticut Commission for Educational Technology. 
Pulling the plug on $2.75 billion
The Digital Equity Act was passed by Congress in 2021 as part of the larger bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The bill was a key piece of the Biden administration’s policy agenda, and it arrived as the COVID-19 pandemic was forcing the nation into remote work and online classrooms — throwing into stark relief who had internet access and who did not.
Lawmakers directed billions of dollars in federal investment into closing those divides. The $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program was enacted to improve and expand internet connections and access in every state. The smaller $2.75 billion Digital Equity Act, which focused on building the digital literacy skills needed to make the most of those connections, served as a companion.
In Connecticut, where 92% of households have access to the internet, the Digital Equity Act was seen as a big help. “What we found was that regardless of connection, people just didn’t have the skills that they needed to use the technology effectively,” Casey said. “They didn’t feel comfortable online.”
Casey’s office has worked to expand digital access and knowledge in the state for years, and it was the natural choice to lead local digital equity efforts. In early 2024, the commission announced that it had completed a 300-page “digital opportunity” plan outlining the skills gaps in the state, the communities and populations most affected by a lack of digital literacy, and Connecticut’s community-driven proposal to remedy those divides.

The resulting plan, “Connecticut: Everyone Connected,” aimed to take a long-term approach that would tackle a range of interrelated issues. It promoted the creation of pilot programs that would connect state residents directly with teachers and skills classes, and it called for indexing resources and building an asset map to show exactly where those support providers are located in the state. A new digital equity curriculum would make it easier to teach and review standard concepts with residents on a recurring basis.
The policy required states to focus their plans on certain “covered populations” — groups the federal government determined needed special attention: veterans, low-income communities, seniors over the age of 60, people with disabilities, those with low literacy or limited English skills, and racial and ethnic minorities. The largest community was rural populations, defined as anyone who does not live in or near a town with a population of 50,000 or more. 
Connecticut’s digital equity plan was approved by the federal government in March 2024, and the state was waiting to receive the funds. In total, Connecticut was set to receive more than $20 million, a mix of state funding and money for local organizations that won a competitive national grant application process.
“This was a fundamental program to get people online and, more than that, to allow people to participate in the modern world,” said Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement for the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, a national organization supportive of the digital equity money. “Virtually everything we do, from looking up transportation, using the bus, to accessing courts, to using government 311 services, to finding a job, the whole modern world basically has some online component.” 
“This was a fundamental program to get people online and, more than that, to allow people to participate in the modern world.”Drew Garner, the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society
That significance has not protected the program from federal scrutiny. As of now, the digital equity funds have been pulled back from states before they could ever use them. 
And the Trump administration has altered the larger BEAD program, removing many of its initiatives that supported climate change resilience, workforce diversity and broadband affordability. States must now update and resubmit their proposed broadband plans within the next few weeks, a rapid turnaround after months of initial planning. 
In a statement provided to CT Mirror, a spokesperson for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the federal agency tasked with overseeing both the BEAD program and the Digital Equity Act, defended its changes. 
“Congress created the BEAD program to expand Americans’ access to high-speed internet. More than three years later, the program hasn’t connected a single person to broadband,” an NTIA representative said in an emailed statement. “The changes we’ve announced will help the BEAD program move forward quickly, and any time spent implementing these reforms will be outweighed by the savings in time and money from the increased competition, reduction in regulatory burdens and streamlined permitting.”
The agency declined to respond to questions about the end of the Digital Equity Act. 
An ‘absolutely critical’ lifeline
Digital equity advocates say the loss of the federal funding will be felt all over the state, hampering efforts to help vulnerable communities build the skills needed to succeed in school, in the workforce, and in daily life.

Many of the efforts were already underway. 
The United Way of Connecticut was working on changes to its long-active statewide 211 hotline, which is used to connect people in need with resources like housing shelters, mental health providers and utility assistance. The organization had planned to use some of the federal money to expand its database of digital literacy resources and programming. That information would also help the state create an asset map showing the places where additional investment is needed.
With the federal funding now off the table, the organization says it will need to adjust its plans. 
“There’s nothing that we can do that would replicate those millions of dollars that would go into creating new services,” said Amy Casavina Hall, senior vice president of strategic partnerships, development and communications at the United Way of Connecticut. 
The federal termination will also pull $11.9 million in competitive grant funding from Capital Workforce Partners, a regional workforce development board that was hoping to expand digital access in the state’s north-central region.
“This grant would have provided us with the capacity to serve 5,000 households,” CEO Alex Johnson told reporters at a recent press conference. “It would have given us the capacity to support 18,000 individuals, to give them the skills that they need to be able to maneuver in this society.”

East Hartford resident Elaine Andresen said she knows firsthand the importance of digital equity programs. The retired school teacher has been working with her local library to access the support of a digital navigator to help her use the internet and get connected to online banking. 
“It just is nice to have a service,” Andresen said at a recent press conference, noting that Connecticut’s senior citizens often struggle with digital skills as technology continues to change. “You can have the equipment, and people can help you.” 
The digital navigator who worked with Andresen, Magdelena Holler, has been teaching digital literacy skills in the area since 2021, helping people who walk into East Hartford’s Wickham Memorial Library. She meets regularly with more than a dozen clients, assisting them with everything from accessing a website to signing up for a new email address.
“There’s an assumption that everybody knows [how to use the internet] or that everybody has access, and that is just not true,” Holler, who also works as East Hartford Public Library’s digital inclusion manager, said. “Not everybody has the devices, and not everybody has the knowledge to use those things safely. It’s absolutely critical for folks to be able to do things like sign their kids up to school, check their own health records, cancel and make appointments.” 
With funding gone, CT looks for a way forward
Last week, a group of concerned advocates, local and state officials and community members gathered at the Wickham library, joining U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal in lamenting the loss of the federal money and calling for the Digital Equity Act to be restored.
“We wouldn’t tolerate children being unable to read books — so why tolerate people being denied the tools to read the digital world?” Blumenthal said, adding that he believed the funding cuts were “mean-spirited” and “stupid.”
“This is not just a loss of funding — it’s a betrayal of public trust,” he later added. “These programs are about basic survival, finding jobs, accessing health care, communicating with your children’s schools. Rescinding this grant is cruel and senseless.”
It is unclear exactly what will happen next, but without the federal funds, it will be up to state and local governments to find a replacement. It is possible some states may consider suing the federal government to restore the digital equity funds. The Connecticut attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment on whether it was considering legal action. 
The state’s broadband office, meanwhile, said in an email that it is working to ensure that Connecticut’s larger BEAD reapplication will comply with the federal government’s new guidance. 
Without the Digital Equity Act, advocates worry that any reformed broadband plans will come up short in helping the communities that need the internet the most.
“People are still getting scammed every day. People are still not able to apply for jobs, people are still not able to talk to their doctors. All of those things are still happening.”Angela Siefer, National Digital Inclusion Alliance
“The fact that we still need [equity] programs hasn’t changed,” said Angela Siefer, the executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, which is leading a coalition calling for the Digital Equity Act to be restored. “People are still getting scammed every day. People are still not able to apply for jobs, people are still not able to talk to their doctors. All of those things are still happening.” 
“What’s changed is that we don’t have this federal investment that would allow us to figure out what works,” she added. 
In Hartford, Solberg is still figuring out how the library system will move forward. With digital equity funding gone, she had to terminate the contracts for the digital navigators and their manager, a situation that she called “painful.” More than a dozen purchased laptops, intended to help residents in the community build skills, currently sit in her office. 
Solberg said it’s a depressing situation, but the library system will figure out a different way to provide support to the community. 
“The need is real, and [we] want to be part of meeting the need,” she said. “This door is closed, but we’re already thinking about other doors or a window we can climb through.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HPLDigitalWorkshopAlbany1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 05:01:14.955708

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.
But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training, and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Wes. Moore (D) in the fiscal 2026 budget. Many of those cuts were ultimately clawed back. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)The Developmental Disabilities Administration failed to collect almost $119 million in provider payments in a timely manner, despite a new payment system that’s supposed to improve the agency’s financial forecasting, a new audit says.
The payments were made to providers to help them during the transition to the new payment system, with the expectation that those dollars would be returned to the DDA. But more than 100 providers have struggled to return the payments, and as of January a total of $118.8 million was still outstanding.
Auditors believe the agency should have worked faster to recover those payments, just one of the findings in the legislative audit released Monday that found issues with oversight and financial record-keeping at an agency with an already precarious fiscal outlook.
Laura Howell, CEO of the Maryland Association of Community Services, said she wasn’t surprised there were outstanding payments.
“When you transition from one complex system to another complex system – things happen,” Howell said. “Some providers, I think smaller providers, have struggled with that repayment … They’ve (state officials) allowed for a repayment plan, and we think that is a good thing.”
The audit evaluated aspects of DDA operations from June 2021 through April 20, 2024, spanning the transition from the Hogan to the Moore administration. Several concerns identified in the audit have been cited since 2009, but state auditors said in the latest report that they believe the agency is moving in the right direction.
How did we get here?: Analysts, officials unsure how disability agency overspent

One of the issues identified in the audit was a yearslong transition into a new schedule for how the state pays developmental disabilities service providers.
The DDA had used a prospective payment model — providers were paid in advance and costs were reconciled later. But in 2019, it began moving to a fee-for-service model, called the Long-Term Services Support System, that reimbursed providers after services were delivered.
Most providers switched to the new payment model in 2023 and 2024, and all were using the fee-for-service payment model by last September..
During the transition, providers were given prospective payments to get them over the hump, with those payments to be eventually returned to the state. That didn’t happen, the auditors said.
“DDA transitioned providers from the prospective payment to the fee-for-service (FFS) model during the period from December 2019 to September 2024. As a result, any prospective payments that were still outstanding needed to be recovered from the providers,” according to the audit. “Specifically, DDA did not start invoicing providers for the amounts due until February 2024, despite transitioning certain providers as early as December 2019.”
The audit also found that there was not enough information on how long those debts were outstanding – so it is not clear how much of the debts should be turned over to state debt collectors. State regulations “require three written demands for payment made at 30-day intervals” before a debt can be sent to the state’s Central Collection Unit.
The audit also said the DDA was not ensuring that people with developmental disabilities received required annual updates to their service plans.
In fiscal 2022 and 2023, the audit found, more than 1,500 people who received disability services were a year or more overdue for monitoring visits that are supposed to occur quarterly. Those visits help ensure that people are receiving adequate care and supports for their disabilities. More than 8,900 people were missing at least one required quarterly monitoring visit during that time.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In its response to the audit findings, the Department of Health, which oversees the DDA, said it was in the process of enhancing oversight of organizations tasked with conducting the quarterly face-to-face visits and the annual updates to individual service plans.
As for the outstanding payments, the department reported this month that approximately 105 providers still owe the DDA money. The department is giving those providers a chance to set up a payment plan to settle their debt. If they do not, their accounts are sent to state collections.
The department also plans to release a report and summary on the timeline of anticipated collections by September 2025.
Despite the challenges outlined in the report, state auditors believe department’s responses should be “sufficient to address all the issues.”
A written statement from the health department said that it is “encouraged by the improved accountability and compliance level rating of the latest Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) audit.”
“At the same time, we acknowledge that there are still improvements to be made as outlined in the audit responses. We will continue to work on procedures on all levels of DDA operations, including the areas of procurement and oversight procedures,” the statement said.
Howell said she appreciates that the department is making moves to ease the complexities at the DDA.
“The Developmental Disabilities Administration is an incredibly complex administration, with a very complex rate system that has gone through an extraordinary amount of change in the last six years,” she said. “I think DDA is working really hard to improve how they are managing the complexity, how they are managing the finances.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DSC_0554-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 05:01:14.955708

(Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)Muslim and Jewish institutions in Maryland said they were already on high alert when U.S. strikes on Iran over the weekend just ratcheted up the level of vigilance even higher.
“All we can do is tell everyone to adhere to the very intense security protocols that have been in place for a while now, to be vigilant and to follow our procedures,” Guila Franklin Siegel, chief operating officer of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, said Monday.
That message was picked up over the weekend by government institutions around the state, which said they went on high attack Saturday on Iran and a retaliatory strike Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar.
President Donald Trump announced the U.S. strikes Saturday evening against three Iranian nuclear sites, joining Israel in its war against Iran. Just as suddenly Monday evening, hours after the Iranian attack on the base in Qatar, Trump announced a “complete and total ceasefire” between Iran and Israel.
In the meantime, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem briefed governors of the weekend on the threat level and on measures the government was taking to keep the homeland safe.
Gov. Wes Moore said in a Sunday news release that he had been coordinating with the Maryland Military Department and the rest of his Cabinet to ensure the safety of Marylanders locally and internationally.
Trump says ‘complete and total’ ceasefire agreed to by Iran and Israel

“We are actively working with all levels of government to remain vigilant against any potential retaliatory event,” Moore wrote. “Today, my thoughts are also with the Maryland Guard and Service members currently deployed in the Middle East and their families.”
Maryland State Police were also working closely with the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center and other agencies to assess potential impacts on the state, according to spokesperson Elena Russo.
Local Jewish and Muslim groups said they remained on high alert after the weekend’s news.
Franklin Siegel said the Jewish community had been at a heightened state of alert because of recent attacks in Colorado and Washington, and this weekend’s events didn’t change that.
Zainab Chaudry, director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Maryland, said the Muslim community is facing heightened fear following the attacks. For Iranian-Americans living in Maryland, the strikes jeopardize their ability to return home or contact loved ones, she said.
“There’s a very real sense of uncertainty of the scope of the impact,” Chaudry said.
Mosques have also had heightened security generally for the past two years, Chaudry said, because of the Israel-Hamas war. This weekend’s attacks, Chaudry said, furthered already-inflamed tensions in both the United States and the Middle East.
The ongoing wars have created a “very real sense of fatigue” for those impacted in the U.S. she said.
But Franklin Siegel said the “institutional Jewish community” was “incredibly supportive both of Israel’s preemptive attack against Iran and of the United States’ actions this past weekend.”
According to Franklin Siegel, both Islamophobia and antisemitism have spiked in the recent political climate. Chaudry said the U.S. should prioritize its own people and values without getting involved in a war with Iran.
“We have so many of our own problems here at home,” Chaudry said. “We pray for the safety of all innocent civilians.”

“The party exists to win elections, and it’s not a pretty game,” Yost said Friday during a City Club of Cleveland forum. “I’m used to getting bruised by the political process. This was just a little bit bigger bruise that I’m accustomed to.”

The Ohio Republican Party endorsed businessman Vivek Ramaswamy for governor May 9 — a year before the primary. Yost dropped out of the race a week later. 
The City Club of Cleveland originally invited Yost, who officially announced he was running for governor back in January, to speak about his platform for governor before he suspended his campaign. 
“I did offer to withdraw as speaker, but I guess it was too late to find someone more interesting,” Yost said. 
NOTUS reported that Yost asked the Trump administration for an appointment in exchange for suspending his campaign, but ultimately rejected their offer of ambassador to Cyprus. 
When asked if this was true during the forum, Yost said “I think it would be inappropriate to publicly discuss private conversations.”
Michael McIntyre, executive editor of Ideastream Public Media, asked Yost questions during the forum ranging from abortion to Yost’s future. 
Yost, who is against abortion, has appealed the decision to strike down the state’s six-week abortion ban that went into effect for several months after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Ohio’s six-week abortion ban into law in 2019, but it was blocked in court at the time. 
When asked if Yost’s goal was to limit abortion, he said, “It is to preserve those matters that are adjacent to abortion that were passed by our duly elected general assembly, whether they fall within the rubric of the amendment of being directly or indirectly impacting or limiting the right to abortion.”
Ohioans voted to protect access to abortion, fertility treatments, contraception, and miscarriage care through a constitutional amendment in 2023, but Ohio Republican lawmakers recently introduced Ohio House Bill 370, which would ban all abortions – regardless of rape or incest. It would also outlaw IVF and IUDs. 
“I will decline, as I usually do, to take a public opinion on matters in front of the legislature because I have neither a vote nor a veto,” Yost said when asked about the bill. “If it were to pass, it would be my statutory duty under the law to defend it, regardless of whether I agreed with it or not.” 
Yost’s term as state attorney general ends January 2027, and he said he’s still thinking about what he will do next. 
“Eventually I will make a decision,” said Yost, who is term-limited. “What I can tell you is I’m not prepared to go quietly down into that good night and hope to remain active in fighting for Ohio and America’s future.” 
Two candidates have announced so far they are running for attorney general in 2026 — current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber and former Democratic state rep. Elliot Forhan.
Ohio governor race
Ramaswamy and former Morgan County school board president Heather Hill are currently the only GOP candidates running for governor, but Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel previously said he is considering running. 
Former Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton is the only Democrat running for governor and will speak at the City Club of Cleveland on Wednesday. 
Democrats are waiting to see if former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown will run for Senate or Ohio governor, or nothing at all. Currently, gaming and technology businessman Chris Volpe, of Columbus, is the only announced Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in 2026.
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is running for attorney general in 2026; current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague is running for secretary of state in 2026; and current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026.
Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State. Former state representative Elliot Forhan has announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Ohio Attorney General. No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer.

Garmatz United States Courthouse in Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Despite fierce opposition from Maryland landowners, workers for a New Jersey based power company can access private land to survey for the proposed Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project power line, a federal judge ruled.
U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson, in a 52-page opinion handed down Friday, dissected the landowners’ arguments one-by-one, including their assertion that the power company could not be granted access rights because it was not a “body politic or corporate having the power of eminent domain.”
Abelson also rejected the landowners’ attempt to dismiss the lawsuit that was filed in April by PSEG — the Public Service Enterprise Group — against more than 100 landowners along the 67-mile power line route who had refused to allow environmental surveyors on their property.
Attorneys for the landowners were still evaluating the ruling from the U.S. District Court for Maryland and determining next steps, said Joanne Frederick, one of the landowners and head of the group Stop MPRP. The groups of property owners are likely to make their decision “in the coming days,” Frederick said.
A PSEG spokesperson said landowners can expect to receive copies of the judge’s decision by certified mail within a week, but William J. Smith declined to comment on when the power company might begin notifying landowners of its intent to conduct surveys on their property.
“We appreciate the Court’s careful consideration of the facts and application of the law in this matter. We are currently reviewing the decision for the next steps in the process,” Smith wrote in a statement.
Despite efforts by lawmakers, energy bills are going up again. Here’s why.

The Piedmont project was selected by the electricity grid operator serving Maryland — PJM Interconnection — to fulfill a need for more transmission infrastructure amid power plant retirements and a surge in demand for electricity. PJM declared PSEG as the “designated entity” to develop the new line that would connect Allegheny Power System’s Doubs substation in Frederick County to Baltimore Gas and Electric’s Conastone Station in northern Baltimore County.
But now it is the Maryland Public Service Commission that must decide whether the power line should be green-lit. Maryland officials, namely the Maryland Power Plant Research Program (PPRP), concluded that various types of environmental surveys are needed for the PSC to decide whether to issue a certification for the project, called a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
Even though state officials knew some property owners were denying access to surveyors, PPRP said it “saw no option other than to direct PSEG to obtain access to properties in order to conduct ‘field studies'” of potential environmental and socioeconomic problems with the proposed route. That led to the PSEG lawsuit to force landowners to allow access.
In response to the PSEG lawsuit, the landowners argued that the company was not a “body politic or corporate having the power of eminent domain,” but would only get that power after it received the certificate from the PSC allowing the project to go ahead.
Abelson disagreed.
“That is clearly not what the General Assembly had in mind,” he wrote in his decision.
It would not make sense for the surveys to come only after the PSC made its final decision on whether the power line should move forward, since it needs the surveys to make that decision, Abelson said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The Court sees no reason to second-guess the PPRP’s determination that conducting these studies would be in the public interest,” Abelson wrote.
Abelson said that the company showed it would suffer “irreparable harm” without the ability to do the surveys, and that an injunction allowing the surveys is in the public interest.
“If the project is delayed, PSEG is likely to lose any revenue it would otherwise have received had PSEG been able to meet the June 1, 2027 in-service deadline” for the power line, Abelson wrote. “In the absence of conducting these surveys, PSEG risks a level of delay that will almost certainly entail some prospective financial harms.”
Abelson’s preliminary injunction lets PSEG representatives enter a property and “remain … to the extent reasonably necessary to make surveys, run lines or levels, or obtain information relating to the acquisition and future use of the properties in connection with the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project.” It requires that the company provide at least 24 hours of notice of its visits by “taping a notice on the front door.”
Trump follows Biden’s lead on nuclear; Maryland, other states seem to be listening

Frederick called the prospect of that happening “terrifying.”
“Speaking as a landowner … the fact that someone can simply walk up to your front door, post a notice and have unfettered access to your property? That is not acceptable,” she said.
“People are being asked to compromise their constitutional rights, or violate a federal court order,” Frederick said. “People across Maryland are being put in an untenable position.”
At least one county sheriff — Carroll County Sheriff Jim DeWees — told the Baltimore Sun after the ruling that he does not plan to enforce the court order.
“I’m still going to stand with the landowners … I’ll stand with them until the bitter end and use whatever authority I have as the sheriff to stop it,” DeWees told The Sun, which first reported the ruling.
In his ruling, Abelson noted that state law provides that anyone obstructing authorized surveyors can be “punished as for contempt of court.”
Frederick argues that PSEG is using its June 2027 deadline from PJM to expedite the proceedings, and infringe upon the rights of landowners.
“It’s not the landowners’ fault that this timeline is short,” she said. “We’re being asked to forgo our property rights because someone else is late.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-1024x860.jpg,,,2025-06-24 05:01:14.955708

File photo from March 2024. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) called for a state of preparedness Monday amid a “hazardous heat wave” rolling across the country that threatens to raise the heat index in Maryland into the triple digits this week.
State officials are warning Marylanders to take the threat of the rising temperatures seriously.
“We ask that all Marylanders do their part to stay vigilant, stay hydrated, and stay in cool locations as much as possible,” Moore said in a statement Monday. “This State of Preparedness will ensure that Maryland is coordinated and poised to protect our people in anticipation of extreme heat and humidity.”
As of Monday evening, the National Weather Service reported that Maryland faces an extreme heat warning through Wednesday, with a heat index of up to 110 during the hottest parts of the day.
“Many Marylanders are at risk for heat-related illness during extreme heat like we are experiencing this week,” Maryland Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said in a written statement.
There’s already been one heat-related death in Maryland, which came before the current heat wave hit. The health department provides only a range of data on victims, but it appears that the first heat death of the year was a female from Montgomery County between the ages of 0-17, whose death occurred before last week’s heat-related illness surveillance report was filed last Wednesday.
Maryland heads into summer with new workplace protections following deadly 2024 heat season

In recent years, the first deaths of the season have typically been males in their 40s and 50s. Last year, a total 26 people died from heat-related illnesses, the highest death toll since 2018.
As a precaution, Moore’s state of prseparedness order directs the Department of Emergency Management to coordinate state agencies to prepare for potential impacts from hazards or threats, without calling for a state of emergency.
This is also the first year that new state heat safety standards will be in place on worksites, requiring longer and more frequent breaks when the heat index reaches above 90 and 100 degrees. Employers are also expected to provide ample shade and other methods of cooling down for employees working outside and in hot conditions.
State officials hope the new standards will help reduce death and emergency room visits due to heat-related illnesses.
There have already been 164 emergency room and urgent care visits due to heat-related illnesses, according to latest weekly report from the health department.
The department has urged Marylanders to check up on vulnerable family members and on neighbors who are more susceptible to severe heat illnesses.
“Marylanders are advised to never leave children in a car,” the department said last week. “Always check twice to ensure that a vehicle is empty. Even on a 70-degree day, within half an hour, the temperature inside the vehicle can climb to over 100 degrees.”
The department reminds Marylanders to drink plenty of fluids to help cope with the hot weather and urges folks to avoid alcohol, caffeine and overly sweetened beverages. Officials also encourage wearing sunscreen and staying in the shade when possible. Those in need of a cool location can contact their local health departments or call 211 to find the nearest cooling center.
“Remember to check on those who are particularly vulnerable to this weather — including young children, senior citizens, and people with chronic diseases,” Seshamani said. “Be sure that they have the resources they need to stay comfortable and safe, or help them locate one of the dozens of local cooling centers available.”

(Getty Images)Right now, Congress is debating changes to two programs that serve as lifelines for working families and individuals in Maryland and across the country.
A bill that passed the House of Representatives last month could significantly weaken our nation’s safety net by cutting nearly $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly called food stamps) and $625 billion from Medicaid over 10 years. Both programs aid low-income individuals and families who are weathering tough times to get back on their feet.
This is one of the most substantial reductions in the SNAP program’s history. Nationwide, millions of Americans will see reductions to their benefits, or lose benefits entirely.
Stricter eligibility requirements will disqualify people who are in need, especially older adults and parents. Work-reporting mandates — including for parents of young children — will lead to loss of benefits for those unable to navigate the system, even if they are working.
The loss of funding for these programs would be devastating for Maryland as well, and not just in the ways most people expect.

First, cutting SNAP and Medicaid will increase poverty and food insecurity for working families, children and older adults living at or under the federal poverty level. Nearly 130,000 Marylanders currently on SNAP would be at risk of losing some benefits. An estimated 71,000 Marylanders would lose SNAP benefits entirely; approximately 200,000 Marylanders would lose their health care due to Medicaid cuts.
At the Maryland Food Bank, we know that even with the help of SNAP, many families in our state struggle to afford food. With as many as 1 in 3 people in our state already facing food insecurity, fewer resources will force neighbors to make tradeoffs – like skipping meals and purchasing cheaper, less nutritious food.
Further tightening eligibility requirements will mean that even fewer people will be able to afford the healthy groceries they need to work, learn and contribute to their communities. Eating less nutritious food can have long-term health consequences, particularly for children and vulnerable populations.
While these negative outcomes should be enough to give us pause, there’s less obvious harm that will result from the current proposal to cut benefits. What might surprise many is that the House bill would force states to shoulder much more of the costs of both SNAP and Medicaid, at a time when everyday costs are rising, and state leaders are already tightening belts.
The added financial impact of having to pick up a portion of SNAP program costs could lead to cuts to other essential services like education and health care, or infrastructure or tax increases, placing further strain on Maryland residents.
While we don’t frequently talk about the economic impact of SNAP and Medicaid, cutting these benefits would also have repercussions on businesses across the state. The core of our work at the Maryland Food Bank is to provide access to nutritious food so that communities can thrive. That goes beyond providing a meal today. We want to build a food system that is resilient, equitable, and accessible for all – and that means supporting local economies.
More than 3,800 grocery stores and food retailers in Maryland accept SNAP benefits. According to a recent analysis by the National Grocers Association, SNAP funding supports approximately 31,600 jobs in Maryland and $1.6 billion in direct wages. That translates to over $289 million in state and $333 million in federal tax revenue.
People who have lost benefits will have less to spend at the grocery store and will be more reliant on the 780 food pantries and other feeding sites that partner with the Maryland Food Bank. That means less money powering our economy, and more strain on the food assistance network.
Cutting SNAP is bad for business in Maryland, and it’s bad for families. And this is urgent: The current timeline for the Senate to consider changes to SNAP and Medicaid leaves just days before 3.2 million people lose SNAP benefits. At a time when our neighbors need help the most, these critical programs must be kept in place – for Marylanders and for Maryland’s economy.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-1.jpg,,,2025-06-24 05:01:14.955708

She's studying the effects of earlier urban renewal projects in the community. (Tara Wallace)My nonprofit, the Lighthouse Therapeutic Community Outreach Foundation, has launched a study to understand the long-term socioeconomic and psychological impacts of displacement caused by the construction of the U.S. Interstate System and urban renewal projects in Topeka during the 1950s and 1960s. This study centers the voices of those most affected, those who lived through the bulldozing of homes, businesses and neighborhoods such as “The Bottoms,” along with those who inherited trauma through broken generational ties and systemic divestment.
The goal of Lighthouse TCOF is to give voice to the experience of displacement. And to plot its impact from a generational perspective. For me as a trauma therapist, it informs the work I do to understand how past traumas contribute to present challenges. Namely, the adverse human health and environmental effects stemming from the original project, as well as subsequent traumatization or retraumatization from the current one.
The Polk-Quincy Viaduct project is billed as a modern infrastructure improvement. But the question must be asked, improvement for whom? The original highway displaced hundreds of families, most of them Black families. Decades later, these same communities face renewed disruption without adequate outreach, input, or compensation.
Even more concerning is that this project is happening during massive rollbacks in funding for social service programs and resources. These cuts directly affect access to mental health services, basic needs and housing support, workforce development, and youth services in already under-resourced neighborhoods. These are the very services needed to repair the damage from past displacement, not just to survive it again.
The environmental, health, and quality of life effects of urban renewal projects are often underestimated or ignored despite federal expectations of accountability. The Polk-Quincy expansion could potentially worsen air quality, limit recreational access, and destroy cultural and historic spaces — many of which remain undocumented or are only now being recognized as sites of generational significance.
Studies show that communities near highways suffer higher rates of asthma, chronic stress, and mental health problems. Add to this the cumulative effects of economic hardship, housing instability, and cultural erasure, and the cost is far greater than any environmental impact statement suggests.
This study seeks to document those effects, not just historically, but as they are still felt today. We are inviting community members and descendants of displaced families to complete a survey and, for those selected, participate in interviews. The data will provide a powerful basis for community-driven policy recommendations, advocacy, and reparative considerations.
This isn’t just research. It is truth-telling. It is an act of justice.
To move forward, we need more than widened roads. We need conciliation, equity, and representation. That means pausing to ask whose voices are missing from urban renewal conversations. It means restoring what was taken through community investment, historical preservation and actual, enforceable protections for those most affected.
The federal government may be cutting resources, but we do not have to cut out the people who have carried the socioeconomic and psychological weight of urban renewal for generations.
We must not repeat the past by forgetting it.
If you or someone you know was affected by Topeka’s urban renewal or the construction of the highway system in the 1950s and 1960s, we invite you to share your story. Participate in the study. Speak truth to power. Help us ensure that progress does not come at the cost of justice, once again.

Why does Ohio’s former U.S. senator, hopeful heir to the MAGA throne, keep damning himself with snarky provocations and self-evident lies? How difficult is it for JD Vance to be respectful, instead of derogatory, honest instead of glibly deceitful?
Every time the vice-president is before an open mic he seems to revert to cutting diatribes about people MAGA loves to hate or alternative facts that bely reality. That’s not leadership from someone a heartbeat away from the presidency. That’s venom masquerading as virtue and promoting Orwellian “War is Peace” propaganda. 
Vance has mastered the dark art of manipulating thought through ignore-the-evidence Trumpian rhetoric. He excels at stoking unfounded fear or fanning unquestioned loyalty whenever the boss requires subterfuge as a means to an end. 
Hours after Trump unilaterally (and arguably unconstitutionally) chose to launch an unprovoked attack against Iran early Sunday (without the authorization of Congress) Vance was spouting the doublespeak of Team Trump on Sunday morning talk shows to portray America’s abrupt entry into foreign combat with Israel as a proud accomplishment.
To be clear, the U.S. inserted itself into a hot war by impulsively bombing a sovereign nation on the pretext of an imminent nuclear weapons threat — contradicted by Trump’s own U.S. intelligence community. 
Iranian leaders called America’s act of aggression against their country “unprecedently dangerous” and a “betrayal of diplomacy.” But Vance peered into network cameras and pretended the unforced decision by the U.S. to drop more than a dozen 30,000-pound bombs on three Iranian nuclear facilities was not what it looked like to the rest of the world.
“We’re not at war with Iran,” said Vance with a straight face. “We’re at war with Iran’s nuclear program” — the same one U.S spy agencies and U.S. National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard determined was dormant before Trump sent B-2 stealth bombers into Iranian airspace. 
“We do not want war with Iran,” prattled the Ohio poser in the wake of the largest operational strike ever by those bombers to take out Iranian nuclear sites. “We actually want peace.” 
Despite preemptive attacks certain to inflame greater conflict in an already volatile region.

In an awkward tap dance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Vance tried to pivot from his longtime opposition to proactive military intervention in the Middle East. 
As an Ohio senatorial candidate Vance was adamant about not supporting military action against Iran on its own soil — even as proxy militia groups escalated attacks on U.S. and coalition forces. 
But the staunch isolationist did a 180 on Trump’s recklessness in dragging the U.S. into another sketchy war without an end game. 
Trump was smarter than his predecessors when it came to targeting Tehran with American military muscle, Vance argued unconvincingly, so the risk of the U.S. succumbing to another endless war was slim.  
“I certainly empathize with Americans who are exhausted after 25 years of foreign entanglements in the Middle East,” said the ex-Marine who served in the Iraq entanglement. “I understand the concern, but the difference is that back then, we had dumb presidents, and now we have a president who actually knows how to accomplish America’s national security objectives.” 
Trump directly threatened those objectives by alienating nearly every international partner and ally of the U.S., aligning with autocratic Russia against democratic Ukraine, destroying the federal national security workforce, and eliminating irreplaceable expertise, decimating global foreign assistance investments, nuclear safety protections, cyber security, and more.
But when Trump plunged the U.S. into a Middle East conflict with his bombardment of Iran, he knew exactly who to deploy to disingenuously frame America’s military pounding of that country as preventative medicine to reset fruitful diplomacy and spur peace. 
Vance shelved his skepticism about starting foreign wars without clear objectives or exit strategies and gamely pushed a narrative that Iran essentially had it coming but rest assured the U.S. has “no interest in boots on the ground” or Iranian regime change. Maybe.   
Yet the veep deals in dishonesty like a chameleon changes color. A day before Trump announced his bombing strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure, Vance was in Los Angeles lying through his teeth about the Democratic mayor of the city and governor of the state encouraging violent immigration protests. 
Then he disparaged a former Senate colleague from California who was slammed to the ground and handcuffed at a press conference when he tried to ask the Homeland Security director a question. Vance referred to U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla as “Jose Padilla” (a convicted domestic terrorist) and suggested his ordeal was “political theater.”
Why did Vance spew “lies and utter nonsense in an attempt to provoke division and conflict in our city?” asked LA Mayor Karen Bass. Why did Vance mock the first Latino elected to the U.S. Senate by intentionally misnaming him? 
Same reason he put an Ohio city and its Haitian community in danger with savage lies about pet-eating immigrants: To snag attention, stoke ugly, and distort truth beyond recognition. 
A slick Vance played his fellow citizens for chumps with Trumped-up bull that American troops belong on American streets and a wanton act of war by the U.S. isn’t. That’s not leadership. That’s a glib gaslighting from a cringe-making toady.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

Janet Mills gives the State of the State address on Jan. 30, 2024. (Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills blocked legislation seeking to prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use, one of several of her first vetoes this year announced on Monday.  
The Maine Legislature passed the bill, LD 958, with bipartisan support earlier this month, winning over many Republicans who generally were less supportive of previous attempts to provide the Wabanaki Nations greater sovereignty.
However, a veto was expected and initial votes on the bill indicate there is likely not enough support to override it. Mills’ legal counsel made her opposition clear while the bill was still in committee, arguing such a ban could prevent the state government from addressing unpredictable future infrastructure needs. 
Mills repeated some of the same reasons in her veto letter dated June 20, including that the bill would amount to a “permanent and irrevocable change to state law” — a critique leaders of the Wabanaki Nations have refuted in light of the several recent changes the state has made to grant the Tribes more sovereignty. LD 958 was seen as the next piece of those reforms.
Most other federally recognized tribes are already afforded protection against states being able to seize tribal land for public use. However, the Wabanaki Nations are not, due to repercussions from the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. 
Governor opposed to latest change to Settlement Act backed by Wabanaki Nations

The U.S. government can seize private property for public use, a principle known as eminent domain, however that authority is restricted by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which requires just compensation for land taken, as well as some federal laws. 
In 1834, the federal Indian Nonintercourse Act prohibited land transactions with tribes unless authorized by Congress, but the Settlement Act specified that that federal law was not applicable to the Wabanaki Nations.
Overall, this land settlement agreement has resulted in the tribes being treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations like other federally recognized tribes. Overhauling this act in its entirety is the Wabanaki Nations’ broader goal for greater recognition of their sovereignty — sweeping reform Mills has opposed, opting instead for some targeted, piecemeal changes. 
“The Legislature cannot unilaterally repeal or amend the new language in the future, even if problems with that language become obvious later,” Mills wrote in her veto letter. She’s referring to the fact that federal law authorizes the Maine Legislature to make changes to the act, but only with the consent of the affected Tribes. 
“The Legislature should understand that this bill would permanently deny the state the ability to take even small portions of Tribal Lands abutting public rights of way for uses like road and bridge projects no matter what circumstances may arise many years into the future,” Mills wrote.
However, in recent years, the Legislature has passed, and the Tribes have later ratified, changes to that act, such as expanding tribal authority to prosecute crimes, permitting the Tribes to handle sports betting and ensuring the Tribes receive the benefits and protections of the Violence Against Women Act, the Indian Child Welfare Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act — several of which Mills highlighted in her letter. 
But Mills went on to write that she views the changes sought in LD 958 as counter to those other recent successes. 
Noting the legislative strides came as a result of numerous meetings and conversations, she wrote, “Never once in these discussions did any Tribal leader mention the issue of state eminent domain authority as a problem that should be addressed.” 
The state has not exercised eminent domain over tribal lands since the Settlement Act. Mills pointed to this fact when arguing “LD 958 is a solution in search of a problem.” 
However, Wabanaki leaders have argued it instead shows that the state’s current ability to exercise eminent domain over tribal lands is not actually clear and that any such attempts would likely result in litigation, providing more reason to clarify rights now in the bill. 
The Legislature will have a chance to override Mills’ veto, but after the Maine House of Representatives voted 86-60 and the Senate 20-12, it looks unlikely the chambers can secure the two-thirds threshold that is needed to do so. 
Mills has vetoed four other bills so far this session.
LD 588 sought to give agricultural employees the right to engage in certain concerted activity, which includes talking about wages, working conditions and other employment matters with other employees or the employer. 
LD 1802 aimed to clarify when an indigent criminal defendant is entitled to counsel at the state’s expense. 
LD 1731 would require the state ferry service to consult with an advisory board on matters related to the service, budget, strategic planning and major operational decisions. 
LD 1328 sought to create culturally appropriate and trauma-informed residences to provide services to underserved, underrepresented or disparately impacted individuals in recovery from substance use disorder.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderRoe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case enshrining abortion rights across the country, was overturned three years ago today in a case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, intensifying a yearslong battle over access to reproductive health care in Georgia.
The fallout of the Dobbs decision is continuing to cause ripple effects throughout the state, with advocates on both sides gearing up for a fight that will play out — at least in part — at the ballot box in 2026.
For Democrats, who are hoping to see incumbent U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff reelected for another term, access to reproductive health care is a crucial part of the campaign. High-profile cases of Georgia women whose deaths have been tied to Georgia’s six-week abortion ban have also cast a national spotlight onto the state’s restrictive laws.
Georgia’s law bans most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is usually at about six weeks and before most women know they are pregnant.

Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old mother and nurse, was roughly two months pregnant when she was declared brain dead after experiencing a series of blood clots in mid February. Doctors told Smith’s family that while she had no chance of recovery, her organs would be kept functioning so as not to violate Georgia law.
Months later her baby, Chance, was delivered by emergency cesarean section and taken to the neonatal intensive care unit, weighing one pound 13 ounces. The family said they planned to take Smith off life support last week.
Two other Georgians, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, both died in 2022 after suffering complications from taking abortion pills. Thurman died in a hospital after doctors waited nearly a day to perform a routine procedure to remove fetal tissue from her uterus; Miller died after family members said she was afraid to seek medical care because of the recently enacted six-week abortion ban.
At a press conference held in front of a mural depicting Thurman and Miller, members of the Democratic Party of Georgia criticized the state’s law, citing cases like Thurman, Miller and Smith’s as evidence of the danger Georgia’s ban poses for those seeking reproductive health care.
“We’ve seen multiple women tragically lose their lives and all because some fat cat politicians think that they know better than women, they know better than those women’s families, they know better than doctors about how to make health care decisions about women’s own bodies,”  said Charlie Bailey, who chairs the Democratic Party of Georgia. 
Republicans running for the U.S. Senate in 2026 include Congressman Buddy Carter, who represents a district in coastal Georgia, and Georgia Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King, who have both praised Georgia’s six-week abortion ban. Congressman Mike Collins, a Jackson Republican, is also seen as a potential contender for the race, though he has not announced his candidacy.
  Rep. Shea Roberts. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
State Rep. Shea Roberts, an Atlanta Democrat, highlighted the turmoil Georgia’s abortion restrictions pose for doctors trying to administer care for pregnant patients, and criticized Republicans’ response to the ban’s repercussions.
“Georgia’s abortion laws are vague, often leaving doctors and hospitals scrambling with their lawyers instead of giving patients the care they need,” Roberts said. “These women should be alive today, and they should still be with their families, yet Carter, King and Collins have stood by the very ban that led to these deaths.”
However, state Sen. Ed Setzler, an Acworth Republican who authored Georgia’s six-week abortion ban, said he celebrated the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
“When the Dobbs decision came down, we were overjoyed because it gave legislatures, gave the elected representatives, the people, the ability to handle these very, very difficult circumstances, and balance the very difficult circumstances women find themselves in with the basic right to life of a living, distinct child, and our state took it very seriously,” he said.

Setzler also defended his legislation, officially called the Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act, arguing that provisions aimed at helping pregnant Georgians recover child support during their pregnancies and allowing them to claim “unborn children” on their taxes provided families with extra support that other states’ bans did not include.
“Our state had worked in a very careful and balanced way to give balance to these difficult circumstances with the life of a child in a way that I think was thoughtful,” he added. “Many other states I don’t think took the time that we did to work through that, and I’m proud of the work we did.”
He also criticized Georgia’s Democratic Party, saying it was “sickening” that the party “seizes all these tragic circumstances to try to score points.”
However, reproductive health care advocates argue that restrictions on abortion have caused downstream effects that limit health care access for all Georgians and impact rural residents of the state most acutely.
“The effect Georgia’s abortion ban has on our health system is felt all over the state,” said Jaylen Black, the vice president of marketing and communications for Planned Parenthood Southeast. “Doctors are fleeing the state. Some of them won’t move to Georgia. Medical students avoid residency programs in our state, and that makes it harder for Georgians to get the care that they so desperately need.”
The yearslong court battle over Georgia’s abortion ban
Georgia’s six-week abortion ban was briefly overturned last year in a ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who declared the state’s law unconstitutional after the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective filed a lawsuit in state court in 2022. 
That action was short-lived. The Supreme Court of Georgia quickly reinstated the ban after Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr filed an emergency injunction, allowing the restriction to remain in effect while the court considered a narrow portion of the lawsuit.
However, an unrelated state Supreme Court ruling from earlier this year has complicated the plaintiffs’ case. Wasserman v. Franklin County, which was decided in January, created a new precedent that prevents third-party entities from suing on behalf of someone else. As a result, abortion rights advocates like SisterSong are now unable to file lawsuits on behalf of their patients.
“At a minimum, a plaintiff must assert her own rights to maintain an action in Georgia courts,” the Supreme Court stated in a February ruling in the abortion case.
The case now sits with the Fulton County Superior Court, where McBurney will evaluate whether the plaintiffs still have standing to bring the lawsuit.
“For a second time, the Supreme Court has elected not to address this case on its merits (other than to stay this Court’s ruling on the merits),” McBurney wrote in an order this month. 
The parties now have until July 21 to submit briefs that incorporate the two Supreme Court rulings before the case can proceed.

HB 5002 offered Connecticut a path out of its housing crisis, which will now assuredly worsen.","HB 5002, a bold housing bill passed by both houses of the Democratic-led state legislature, has died ignominiously. 
Gov. Ned Lamont has chosen to veto the bill, torpedoing his own party’s legislation. While Republicans cheer and a few Democrats breathe a sigh of relief, the bill’s defeat is a bad omen. HB 5002 offered the state a path out of its housing crisis, which will now assuredly worsen.
While opposition from the Republican Party was uniform, responsibility for the demise of HB 5002 ultimately falls on members of the Democratic Party. Despite strong backing from policy experts and advocates, influential voices from Connecticut’s wealthier suburbs formed a Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) coalition with the GOP, and persuaded Lamont to adopt a baffling stance on the home-affordability issue: deer-in-headlights indecision. This political inaction will harm young families, working folks, and the Democratic Party nationwide.
Why are homes so expensive here, anyways? Connecticut offers a high quality of life, strong public services, and access to major cultural and commercial hubs. Its climate is mild and under Lamont, the state has enjoyed fiscal stability. Unsurprisingly, many want to live here. But outdated zoning rules, defended by homeowners through local planning boards, make it hard to increase housing supply in order to keep up with demand. HB 5002 aimed to excise the regulations that make housing such a scarce, and thus expensive, commodity.
Some shrug off the crisis, “Not everyone gets to live in nice places.” But the people being priced out aren’t just undeserving out-of-state supplicants; they’re the next generation. Young people who did everything right, went to college and landed white-collar jobs, still can’t afford a modest home in much of Connecticut. When home costs explode it’s not just outsiders who are made to suffer.
Additionally, experts agree: the primary driver of homelessness is the price of housing. HB 5002 would have cut the red tape that chokes housing supply, lowering costs. With its veto, we can expect to see more people suffering the indignity of being unhoused in our public spaces. 
Those who are not homeless, but home-insecure (spending over 30% of their income on housing) will also feel the pinch. When supply is constrained and demand remains high, it’s not the 23-year-old software engineer who gets priced out; it’s the single mother working as a waitress. Democrats oppose gentrification, but by obstructing home construction, they make it inevitable.
So why would Democrats help kill a bill that would uplift groups they claim to support: working folks, the unhoused, and young families?
Many opposed HB 5002 because it would have taken planning prerogatives out of the hands of local communities, rules about what kind of housing can be built and where, and parking mandates. These rules may seem trivial, but suggesting their repeal sparks backlash. Progressive opponents of deregulation argue that greedy developers cannot be trusted to determine parking needs without a mandate. They believe that local authorities know what housing will fit best, not the imperious invisible hand of the free market. Others insist that new housing must wait for transportation upgrades, but then build neither bike paths nor homes.
Some of the objections were made in good faith. It’s fair to be skeptical of developer motives or to want growth that aligns with community character. But when the fear of hypothetical problems paralyzes us, existing issues only become worse. HB 5002 was imperfect, but by letting perfect become the enemy of the good, Democrats have made a grievous error.
I hope Connecticut’s legislators refocus on the housing crisis next session with unity and urgency. Democrats who lobbied Lamont to kill HB 5002 must recognize that their resistance to new housing does not just harm vulnerable communities, but also their own party’s continued survival.
After the 2020 census, congressional seats shifted. Liberal strongholds like New York and California lost representation in the House and have diminished power in presidential elections, while red states like Texas and Florida have gained influence. Why? Red states are building affordable homes, and people are voting with their feet.  No matter how desirable life is in California, New York, or Connecticut, if people can’t afford to live there, they’ll leave. When Democrats in blue states choke housing construction they sap their own electoral strength. By loudly insisting that you support more affordable housing, just not in your neighborhood, you make a Democratic candidate’s path to the presidency that much narrower.
In an earlier commentary, I compared the passage of HB 5002 to bitter but necessary medicine. By scrapping the bill, promising vague “improvements” in a future legislative session, Lamont and anti-housing Democrats have declined a shot of penicillin in order to explore the restorative possibilities of snake oil.

On Friday June 13, Israel unleashed an enormously complex campaign of strikes to thwart Iran’s imminent acquisition of nuclear weapons. A week later, at President Trump’s direction, America’s B2 bombers finished off the last underground nuclear site that lay beyond Israel’s reach.
Yet within hours of Israel’s opening salvos, several of the world’s self-appointed moral arbiters unleashed a wave of verbal attacks, condemning Israel’s and then Trump’s efforts to spare the world the nightmare of Iran’s genocidal dictators going nuclear.
From far off in peaceful Geneva, the World Council of Churches thundered its condemnation, denouncing Israeli “aggression [that] endangers the entire Middle East region.” Notably absent from that declaration was any mention of Iran’s decades of dangerous aggression, like its funding and arming terror brigades across the region, and its constant threats to genocidally obliterate Israel.
Likewise, from its plush headquarters in Washington D.C., Churches for Middle East Peace “condemn[ed] in the strongest possible terms” Israel’s having “risk[ed] the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the Middle East.” Here too Iran’s history of Mideast murder and mayhem escaped condemnation from those self-appointed voices of peace.
Democratic party leaders issued similar one-sided denunciations, including Connecticut U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, who declared: “This is a disaster of Trump and Netanyahu’s own making” – as if Iran had no role in fomenting the crisis.
Similar denunciations followed America’s subsequent strike on the underground Fordo site. The U.N. Secretary General scolded Trump’s “dangerous escalation,” while Murphy returned to denounce Trump as “dangerously reckless.”
Several prominent human rights non-profits also joined the pile-on, denouncing the strikes while keeping silent about Iran’s oft-declared intent to annihilate Israel. Amnesty International, American Friends Service Committee, Foundation for Middle East Peace, and several others deployed their taxpayer-subsidized influence to defend this upside-down moral position.
In fact, the moral and geopolitical landscape is the precise opposite of what those voices of denunciation claim. And this is far from a close call: the difference between the right and wrong actors is highly visible and manifestly obvious. That difference is highlighted by the following critical facts – all neglected by the West’s army of moral scolds:
First as noted, Iran has for decades declared ad nauseum its commitment to the genocidal annihilation of Israel. Its leaders endlessly call for “the complete obliteration of the Zionist regime,” and pledge again and again “the destruction of the cancerous microbe Israel.”
Second, far from that being mere rhetoric, Iran has invested massively in this genocidal project. It financed and armed a murderous ring of terror armies encircling Israel: Hamas to the southwest, Houthis to the southeast, Syria-based militias to the northeast, and Hezbollah to the north. Intelligence sources recently revealed Iran’s plans to unleash those terror armies all at once, in a surprise attack “from all sides, with thousands of terrorists.” In other words, a massively larger replay of Hamas’s October 7 genocidal horrors.
Third, Iran’s annihilationist goals extend far beyond Israel, with America at the top of its target list. Its leaders constantly call for “Death to America.” Iran has orchestrated numerous killings of Americans, including: the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, killing 241 U.S. troops; Iran’s proxy militias in Iraq that killed over 600 American soldiers; Iranian bounty payments for Taliban attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan; three Americans murdered by a drone attack in Jordan; and years of Houthi attacks on U.S. ships.
Iran’s shadow war on America also includes its brazen plots to carry out assassinations of both ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and President Donald Trump.
Fourth, negotiating Iran off its path to nuclear capacity was never a possible option. The 2015 JCPOA – the “best” deal available – was riddled with holes: it banned no-notice inspections; and it explicitly permitted Iran to build nuclear weapons after ten years. Insisting on negotiations as the sole approach to Iran means in actuality, guaranteeing a nuclear Iran.
But fifth and most dangerous is the nuclear arms race set to take off once Iran reaches nuclear capacity. Many experts have warned that once Iran goes nuclear, the Saudis, Turks, and likely other regimes would all launch nuclear weapons efforts. By eliminating Iran’s nuclear program now, Israel and America prevented the imminent launch of a nuclear arms race across the Islamic world.
These facts illuminate the morally bankrupt reasoning of the Israel-Trump scolds. They condemn both parties for preventing a second Holocaust and for precluding a catastrophic Mideast nuclear arms race. Worse, they offer nothing else that could prevent the genocidal Iranian dictatorship from building a horrifying arsenal of nuclear weapons.
These hard realities make clear that there is one, and only one, morally serious response to Israel’s and President Trump’s take-down of Iran’s nuclear program. Namely: Thank you Israel, and thank you President Trump – for acting when no one else would, and for walking humanity back off the path to nuclear Armageddon.

There was serious sausage making going on during the debate on this bill. There are so many things wrong with this 92-page bill that it is a daunting challenge to even find a place to start.
The bill is so confusing and internally inconsistent that Gov. Ned Lamont, on whose desk the bill sits waiting for his signature or veto, remarked, “the question is, do you sign it and fix the bill later, or don’t sign it and get a new bill that takes down the temperature a little bit.” [Lamont vetoed the bill Monday.– Ed.]
Governor, the responsible course is to veto now and fix later!
There are powerful voices who support this bill. They are engaged in smug virtue signaling concern for the poor and homeless. However, they avoid anything so mundane as analyzing the actual language of the bill adopted by the General Assembly. They love high blown rhetoric, but don’t wish to be confused by the actual language of the bill.
The proponents of the bill provide us with an example of the concern and compassion they claim to have for the poor when they pontificate from on high, in Section 2 of the bill.
This section reads that zoning regulations, “shall not require a minimum number of off-street motor vehicle parking spaces for any residential development except as provided in section 3.”
It appears that in the world inhabited by the “Guardians of the Poor,” most of us need parking, but somehow, the poor do not.
This means that a local planning and zoning commission cannot deny an application for a residential development for lack of off-street parking, a bonanza for high-density development and another burden for the working poor.
So much for Connecticut’s tradition of local control!
Central planners have issued an edict that ‘experts’ know what is best for a local community, with a one-size fits all approach.
This section unambiguously removes the discretion from a local commission to make decisions regarding off-street parking.
As an afterthought during the sausage making, (due to the uproar raised by residents throughout Connecticut) a narrow exception to the ‘no minimum off-street parking requirement was added in a new Section 3. The new language does not remove the “no minimum off street parking’ prohibition but rather puts an additional burden on the municipal zoning commission to justify a rejection based upon parking considerations. The Commission must make a finding “that a lack of such parking will have a specific adverse impact on public health and safety.”
This is a difficult burden for a commission to meet.
This section also requires that all applications for residential developments of over 24 dwelling units shall include a “parking needs assessment” that provides an analysis of options that may be used by residents to mitigate the need for off-street parking.
The 24-unit cut off is an arbitrary figure. Developments of less than 24 dwelling units are not required to provide an assessment of parking needs.
The experts have not provided us with an explanation for the distinction. Nor have they adequately explained why no state in the U.S. has a statewide policy of no minimum off street parking requirement. Perhaps, it is because it does not work.
One such development in Bridgeport has put a face on the reality of the consequences of this ruling from on high.
In an already congested area, without an effective mass transit system, where all children qualify for free lunches in the public schools, a 74-unit residential development with 900 square feet of commercial space on the first floor, and no off-street parking has been approved on a postage stamp size lot on East Main Street.
This is not because of HB 5002, but rather because many of the experts influencing HB 5002 were busy at work in Bridgeport revising the local zoning regulations during COVID. Minimum off-street parking requirements were eliminated in the rewriting of the regulations.
This Bridgeport development is the fruit of the seeds planted during the invasion of the experts under cover of COVID. It helps us read the tea leaves.
Sadly, Michael Chuchev, in an op-ed published on June 20, describes the elimination of off-street parking minimums as a positive effect on “some of the worst excesses of municipal zoning.”
If he could only walk in the shoes of someone who in real time will be affected by the consequences of this bill, such as a single mother and sole breadwinner hunting for a parking space after a 3 to 11 shift. But the elite central planners are far removed from East Main Street in Bridgeport.
Yes, Governor, you can turn down the temperature on this bill.
Your honest statement that you wished you had been involved in negotiating the language of this bill earlier is to be commended and applauded. Your healthy skepticism is warranted and appreciated.
Please veto this bill and call the legislature into special session to get this sausage making right with a new recipe that includes input from all impacted parties.

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — As the U.S. Senate prepares for a vote as early as this week on a budget reconciliation bill, Nebraskans gathered and called on their congressional delegation to consider the negative impacts of the legislation on health care. 
Over a dozen people spoke out against the proposal at a town hall in Omaha hosted by Nebraska Appleseed and the American Cancer Society Action Network. Speakers included state senators, medical professionals, activists and everyday Nebraskans. All said the current proposal would have disastrous consequences for health care access across the state.

“It’s been across the board, people are raising the alarm bells as to just how harmful this is going to be,” said State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln. 
Congress is currently considering a budget reconciliation bill that would accomplish several goals President Donald Trump campaigned on. Among many other things, the proposal would scale back Medicaid benefits nationwide. 
A version of the bill has already passed the House, and Senate leaders say they’re hoping to vote on their version soon, with the goal to send the bill to Trump’s desk by July 4. 
With the Senate bill still in flux, Monday’s town hall focused on the House version of the bill, according to Nebraska Appleseed program director Sarah Maresh. Under the bill, Maresh said up to 55,000 Nebraskans could lose their health care coverage, and the state itself could lose roughly $4 billion in federal funding for the program. 
Even for people on private insurance, Maresh said the House proposal would have widespread negative impacts on Nebraska’s health care industry. For one, she said wait times in emergency rooms would likely increase, as more people are forced to put off preventative treatment until their ailments grow un-ignorable. 
“Everyone is going to feel the impacts of these cuts,” Maresh said. 
Prokop said the funding cuts would shift more burden onto state governments and noted that Nebraska has already faced tough budget challenges this year that are likely to continue. 
Trevor Toteve, policy analyst for OpenSky Policy Institute, said the cap on provider taxes included in the bill would halve federal funds slated to come to Nebraska from a hospital assessment bill state lawmakers passed last year. 
Prokop also said the bill goes against the Medicaid expansion Nebraska voters passed in 2018, continuing a trend established in the Legislature this session of some state leaders ignoring the will of voters. His remark prompted audible murmurs of agreement from the crowd. 
What Nebraska’s congressional delegates have to say
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., has expressed hesitance in supporting Medicaid cuts, but he voted for them after he said he received assurances that the bill would not degrade the quality of health care for people covered by Medicaid. He said he supports provisions of the bill that would impose work requirements on able-bodied adults and bar people in the country illegally from accessing coverage. 
“Requiring able-bodied adults to work, removing those enrolled twice or not here in the country legally and a yearly audit are easy to defend,” Bacon said in an emailed statement. 
U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., had similar thoughts to Bacon’s, saying that he wants to address “waste, fraud and abuse,” while ensuring that vulnerable Americans retain access to Medicaid.
Creighton University medical student Marshall Biven called comments like theirs “disinformation” on Monday, noting that migrants without documentation already aren’t allowed to access Medicaid. 
In response to House passage of the bill, U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., celebrated the “historic tax relief” he said the bill would provide and argued that it would “refocus” Medicaid on its core mission. 
“These common sense conservative policies are a victory for the American people, and we urge our colleagues in the Senate to act swiftly so that the president can sign this bill into law,” Flood said. 
Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer’s office declined to comment on the town hall. The office of fellow GOP U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts had no immediate response to a request for comment. 
More concerns expressed
Maresh addressed the arguments favoring the work requirements proposed in the bill, claiming similar strategies have proven ineffective in encouraging more people to work. 
Edison McDonald, executive director of National Disability Action, expanded on this, saying that while he was leading a past business, a disabled employee declined a promotion he offered her because it would make her ineligible for her $60,000 annual Medicaid coverage. 
“What I’ve seen through my time is how frustrating the process is,” McDonald said. “How many times the government gets in the way of encouraging work.” 
Biven, the Creighton medical student, argued a provision of the bill that would cap student loan borrowing would further discourage students from entering medical school. The maximum cap up for consideration is $200,000, and Biven said he is on track to be roughly $400,000 in loan debt by the time he graduates in 2028.
Ann Anderson Berry, executive director of the Child Health Research Institute at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said the bill would have major impacts on Nebraska’s maternal health care field, which was already struggling. 
She said Nebraska currently ranks fifth for maternal health care deserts, places with the longest distance to travel to access maternal health care, and is also dealing with rising infant mortality rates. Further cuts would only continue to harm access, she said. 
“I can’t think of a worse decision for Nebraska families,” Berry said.

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/Source New Mexico)The U.S. Forest Service will seek to repeal a rule that has effectively blocked the logging of almost a third of America’s national forests, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins told a meeting of Western governors on Monday in New Mexico.
The “Roadless Rule” has blocked the construction of new roads in wild areas of most states’ national forests since 2001, when it was imposed in the closing days of President Bill Clinton’s presidency.
“In this administration, we are taking a look under the hood of each and every regulation that affects the everyday lives of the American people, and this rule certainly affects the everyday lives of every single American living in the American West,” Rollins told officials assembled at the Western Governors Association meeting. 
“That’s why I’m excited to announce today here with you, for the first time, our intent to repeal the disastrous Roadless Rule. The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests under the leadership of President Trump,” she said.
Lifting the rule would allow the construction of roads, a needed prerequisite for development and logging, in significant parts of the Tongass National Forest, the largest remaining temperate rainforest on Earth. Ninety-two percent of the Tongass is considered a roadless area.
“There’s no doubt about it, we are continuing to be aggressive in our efforts to increase American timber production in line with President Trump’s agenda,” Rollins said.
Rollins’ announcement was criticized by environmental groups, who vowed to oppose it.
“Secretary Rollins is taking a blowtorch to a landmark rule that shields almost 60 million acres of national forests from the serious impacts roads can have, not only on wildlife and their habitats but also on the nation’s drinking water sources,” said Vera Smith, director of national forests and lands for Defenders of Wildlife, a national group. 
“America’s roadless forests are crucial strongholds for wildlife including at-risk species that are battling extinction. Sec. Rollins’ boon to industry is yet another punishing blow to the American people and the wildlife and wild places we all hold dear,” Smith said in a written statement.
The Roadless Rule has been the subject of lawsuits for decades, particularly in Alaska, where most of the California-sized Tongass is covered by the rule.
Republican presidents have sought to reduce or eliminate the rule and have been opposed in court by environmental groups. Democratic presidents have sought to keep the rule and have been opposed by logging and development trade groups.
If the Roadless Rule were a box, almost all of the action since 2001 has taken place within that box, as groups attempt to exempt certain states or parts of states.
The new rulemaking process announced by Rollins would throw out the box altogether.
“What Secretary Rollins pledged today was to rescind the whole Roadless Rule, the whole enchilada,” said Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans at the law firm Earthjustice.
More than 96% of roadless areas are located in 12 Western states, and Alaska alone has almost 15 million acres of roadless area, mostly in Southeast Alaska, but also in the Chugach National Forest near Anchorage. 
Idaho, which has the second-largest amount of roadless Forest Service land, is already exempted from the Roadless Rule, as is Colorado. Idaho and Colorado have state-specific rules that supersede the federal rule.
Montana, the No. 3 roadless state, has more than 6 million acres of roadless forest.
“They are the wildest lands on the National Forest System, de facto wilderness. And the only reason to rescind the Roadless Rule is if you want to undermine the wild character of these lands by invading the wilderness,” Caputo said. 
Rollins, speaking in New Mexico, said she believes that rescinding the rule would allow the Forest Service and other organizations to more efficiently fight fires in national forests and allow timber cutting that could reduce fire danger.
“That’s great news,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, in response to Rollins’ announcement.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it, and if we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve (timber) production,” Cox said.
In Southeast Alaska, the Tongass National Forest is a rainforest and isn’t subject to significant wildfire danger. Rescinding the Roadless Rule there would directly allow new mines and logging.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLEThe proposal drew immediate pushback from regional conservationists.
“The Tongass National Forest is our home — it sustains our communities, supports our fisheries, our recreation and tourism economy, provides critical climate change mitigation, and nourishes the deer and salmon we rely on for sustenance,” said Maggie Rabb, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, in a written statement. “Opening up more of the Tongass to large-scale, clearcut logging is an existential threat to the authentic values of the forest and our Southeast Alaska ways of life.”
SEACC and a collection of environmental, tourism and tribal groups are currently fighting a lawsuit that seeks to reverse the Roadless Rule in the Tongass.
The lead plaintiff in that suit is the Alaska Forest Association, a logging trade group whose leadership praised the new plan.
“The Alaska Forest Association applauds the Secretary’s decision to repeal the Roadless Rule,” said Tessa Axelson, the association’s director.
“The Rule has contributed to the decline of the timber industry in Southeast Alaska for over twenty years, and more importantly, limited critical access for project development and mining that can and should support rural community needs, decrease energy costs, and power the economy of AK, and the United States,” Axelson said in an email provided by the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing the Forest Association in its lawsuit.
“By rescinding the rule, the Secretary is taking a step in the right direction to restore Congress’s intent that our natural resources should be put to productive use and our forests should be actively managed,” she said.
Back in New Mexico, Rollins insinuated that the Roadless Rule repeal is only one of several policy proposals that the Trump administration is planning.
“We are not even six months into what promises to be arguably one of the most transformative administrations of our lifetime,” she said.

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis)North Carolina senators approved a massive hurricane relief package Monday, thawing out a bill that had been frozen for a month and passing it with major changes.
Senate Republicans’ proposed aid for western North Carolina lays out vastly more money than the bill passed by the House in May — around $2.46 billion in total. And it makes changes to several major line-items in the House version’s, which totaled $464 million.
Among the most notable changes: the removal of a $60 million grant program for small businesses, a longtime request as many storefronts struggle to reopen due to flooding and lost tourism.
In the new bill, $700 million in spending is sent to the state’s Helene recovery fund. Of that money, $465 million is appropriated, leaving the rest for future aid.
The remaining money includes federal funding and money to qualify municipalities for competitive grants, among other purposes, according to Fiscal Research Division staff at the General Assembly. Lawmakers have redirected more than half a billion dollars from local aid, road repairs and other state programs toward Helene relief.
House lawmakers and advocates in the region have for weeks requested that the Senate take up the bill and pass it, as the mountains continue to recover from Helene.
The aid package sat in committee for a month as leaders in the House and Senate negotiated the state budget; they have yet to come to an agreement.
On Monday, they got their wish, as Senate Republicans fast-tracked it through committee and onto the floor. The aid package passed in a unanimous vote.
But the removal of business grants, as well as an array of other differences, will spark frustration — and could lead to even further delay.
“This allows us — on transportation funds, on private roads and bridges — to address some of those issues,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell) said.
Senate Democrats said they had reservations about the changes to the House’s bill, which received unanimous support. And they were dubious that House Republicans would agree to the Senate’s changes.
“I certainly don’t think the House is going to concur with them, because they haven’t been pre-negotiated with the House,” said Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange) in an interview. “They’ve basically admitted that.”
If the bill clears the Senate this week, it will return to the House, who must agree to the changes to send it to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk.
Both chambers will debate a flurry of legislation this week in what is widely viewed as a final push before they leave Raleigh for weeks.
Senate Republicans scratch business grants from aid bill. They say it’s a constitutional issue.
Hise, asked by reporters Monday about why the Senate had removed money for small business grants, cited the state’s “emoluments clause.”
The North Carolina constitution declares that “no person … is entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community but in consideration of public services.”
Hise argues that includes a grant program, in which the state would select specific businesses to receive money, falls under that umbrella.
“We have not found a way to successfully get around that concept,” Hise said.
He said he planned to bring forward a constitutional amendment on the matter, which would require approval from the legislature and a majority of voters. It’s unclear what that timeline would look like.
Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said in an interview that if Republicans “were that concerned,” they should have discussed the issue with the House “instead of just jettisoning the entire bill.”
“This is literally playing with our western North Carolinian neighbors’ lives and livelihoods and welfare,” Batch said. “Only to get political chips and negotiations while we go into a budget debate.”
Past legal analyses of the state’s emoluments clause have come to different conclusions than Hise.
The North Carolina attorney general’s office under Mike Easley, a Democrat, wrote in a 1999 opinion to legislative leaders that natural disaster grant programs for farmers, homeowners and small businesses would benefit “the public good.”
And a 2019 legal review from UNC professor John Orth found that “emoluments … may include benefits or privileges granted in consideration of public services more generally.”
One western Democrat, during floor debate Monday, pointed out that one private business in the region — the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad — was set to receive money in the same bill.
“That is something this body has refused to do since last October,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe).",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-23 20:59:36.265630

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday afternoon that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land. 
Rollins, speaking at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests. 
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said. 
US Interior Secretary Burgum hypes innovation at WGA, steers clear of public lands controversy

The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy. 
“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.” 
The “Roadless Rule” repeal would mean more than 58 million acres of land in 38 states would lose their protections. In New Mexico, according to Forest Service data, about 1.6 million acres, or roughly 2,500 square miles, of land in all the state’s national forests have some level of protections. A 2003 Forest Service map suggests most of the areas losing protections are in the Santa Fe and Gila national forests. 
Public lands protesters picket Western governors’ conference

The announcement drew mixed reactions from the western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said. 
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office. 
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation. 
Governors’ report outlines how western states, territories could build more affordable housing

Rollins made the announcement during one of several keynote addresses by President Donald Trump’s cabinet members during the WGA conference. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spoke earlier Monday, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke afterward. 
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9951-1024x768.png,,,2025-06-23 20:59:36.265630

Omaha-based Noddle Companies is developing the 31-acre mixed-use project, which is part of the larger 132-acre Gretna Landing subdivision northwest of 192nd Street and Highway 370.
Gretna Mayor Mike Evans said Monday that the Noddle-led venture is key, as it will create a needed job base in the growing suburban community situated between the cities of Omaha and Lincoln — the developer expects 500 jobs when the site is built out. 
Live, work, play
Poised to rise on the high-density site, said CEO Jay Noddle: an estimated 75,000 square feet of retail space; about 300 apartment and townhome dwellings and about 170,000 square feet of office space, most of which is the health care center.
A highlight, Evans said, will be the open green space for gatherings and events. He likened the project to other Noddle live, work and play developments, including Aksarben Village in midtown Omaha that lure activity, shoppers and people. 
“Open spaces where you can build community — where you can gather, have experiences, where artists can come out and sing or hold events,” Evans said.
Construction is to start later this summer. Additional tenants are to be announced in coming months.
The health center, described as a centerpiece of the Noddle project site, is to span 125,000 square feet and open in the second half of 2027. Expected services include primary care, urgent care, pharmacy, sports medicine and orthopaedics and laboratories, said a Nebraska Medicine statement.

Dr. James Linder, CEO and chairman of Nebraska Medicine, said that as a leading academic health system in the region, Nebraska Medicine is proud to expand its services to the growing Sarpy County area.
“Nebraska Medicine’s public-private structure enables opportunities like this one to give Sarpy County residents access to primary and selected specialty care they need closer to where they live,” Linder said in a statement.
Destinations
Noddle said his development team has been searching for the right opportunity in Gretna for years. He said the Nebraska Medicine center will be a destination, and other places in the general vicinity also are big draws.
Among those, he said, is the huge HyVee store, a youth sports complex and a future cheer facility.
“There are a lot of draws and we’re right in the middle of it,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 00:35:13+00:00,CT Mirror,Himes and CT delegation wait for answers on Iran bombing,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/23/ct-us-bombs-iran-himes-war-powers-resolution/,Himes is expected to introduce a war powers resolution to block U.S. involvement in the conflict between Iran and Israel.,"U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, learned about the U.S. strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran in the same way as many of the public did — through social media.
As the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, he said he thought that would warrant some kind of advance notice. Himes is part of the “Gang of Eight,” a group of Senate and House leaders plus relevant committee heads in both parties who get briefed on intelligence matters by the administration.
The top leaders were notified ahead of time, with varying levels of detail. Intelligence Committee staff received a classified briefing on Sunday, the day after the strike.
“I learned about the strike last tonight on Twitter,” Himes told CNN on Sunday. “As a member of the Gang of Eight, you might think for something this consequential, we would be informed of any change in intelligence.”
“Let’s not lose sight of the fact that an offensive attack against a foreign nation is something that the Constitution reserves to the Congress of the United States,” he added.
Himes and Connecticut’s congressional delegation hope to get more answers this week as they returned to Washington Monday following the U.S. strikes, Iran’s retaliatory response and the latest news of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Congress will get briefed by the Trump administration Tuesday afternoon from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
And as the state’s delegation questions the constitutionality of the attacks, some members are proposing war powers resolutions to block U.S. involvement in the conflict between Iran and Israel. The Constitution grants the legislative branch the ability to “declare war.” The War Powers Act of 1973 requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action if there is no declaration of war.
Himes, along with U.S. Reps. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and Adam Smith, D-Wash., are expected to introduce their own version later Monday, an aide familiar with the effort confirmed. The details and text of the resolution were not immediately available.
That is on top of the resolution that’s already been introduced by a bipartisan pair of lawmakers to “to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or military, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force against Iran.” It is a concurrent resolution, which doesn’t require the signature of a president and is not usually considered binding.
The Senate has its own version that U.S. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said could come up for a vote later this week, according to Politico. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., had urged GOP leadership to bring it up for an immediate vote.
Once the Himes resolution is formally introduced, a floor vote in the House is required within 15 days. But under House rules, that doesn’t count pro forma session days that happen during a recess, and Congress will be off for a week for the July 4 holiday. That would push the 15-day window farther into July.
But House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., poured cold water on war powers resolutions, saying that it “is not a time for politics.” He argued Democrats haven’t taken umbrage to past Democratic administrations who have taken unilateral military actions in certain circumstances. And he pointed to presidents in both parties who have relied on Article II as giving them that authority.
Since President Donald Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire over social media, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., indicated that the bipartisan resolution he introduced “might not be necessary,” according to D.C.-based publication Punchbowl News.
“I don’t think this is an appropriate time for a war powers resolution, and I don’t think it’s necessary,” Johnson told reporters Monday. “President Obama went on an eight-month campaign bombing Libya to take down the regime there. I never heard a Democrat balk about any of that. And suddenly now, they’re just up in arms. It’s all politics. This is not a time for politics.”
Tuesday will be the first time all of Congress can get more clarity on what led to U.S. involvement in the Middle East conflict and the bombing of three nuclear facilities. And Connecticut’s members want to know if anything changed from March when Gabbard testified that the U.S. intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.”
“I had not seen any intelligence as a member of the Gang of Eight to suggest that Iran had taken the decision to build a weapon,” Himes said on CNN. “I don’t think there’s any intelligence out there that suggests that that’s true.”
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said he wants to get more insight into the damage assessment and what officials are doing in terms of “risk mitigation” for U.S. forces in the region. His comments on Monday came before news of Iran’s retaliatory strike on a U.S. Air Force base in Qatar — which was intercepted by Qatari air defenses — and Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.
“It certainly appeared that the decision was made by a pretty small group of people. Given what our country has been through, I think it definitely deserved a lot more time and deliberation,” Courtney said in an interview. “The thing about the constitutional question of getting authorization, honestly, I think is that aside from the constitutional balance of powers, check and balances, it also really allows for more analysis and voices to be heard.”
Courtney, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, said in the week leading up to the strike when Trump was weighing whether to get involved, the calls to his office were “starting to pick up speed” with concerns over a escalating conflict that could mirror wars in Iraq and Afghanistan where the U.S. was involved for decades.
“I think the experience of Iraq and Afghanistan is really a burning memory for people,” Courtney said earlier Monday. “I think that the appetite for going back into the Middle East with an active military posture is not something that people are supporting, by any stretch.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-bombs-iran-AP.jpg,,,2025-06-23 20:59:36.265630

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden is giving new life to a training program for inmates that was shelved recently.
“Being Open for Opportunity means investing in people and believing in second chances,” Rhoden said in a statement Monday, referencing a slogan he often uses to promote economic development.
The program will bring on-site instruction to the state penitentiary so inmates can earn a certificate to work on diesel heavy equipment.
Inmate training program shelved while prison construction talks continue

Last August, the Department of Corrections and Southeast Technical College got approval from the state Board of Technical Education to expand the college’s diesel program to the penitentiary.
Officials later decided to shelve the initiative due to a lack of funding and concerns over how it would fit into the still-developing plans for construction of a new men’s prison at an undetermined site. 
Rhoden announced Monday that he will provide $1.5 million for the training program from the Future Fund, a pot of economic development money under the exclusive control of the governor.
Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko praised the program’s reinstatement.
“Education is one of the best ways to support rehabilitation and reduce recidivism,” Wasko said in a statement. “These programs give people purpose, build skills, and strengthen families and communities across South Dakota.”
The diesel training program will fill a void left by Metal Craft Industries, a privately operated prison shop that employed inmates at market wages. The company said it was pushed out of the prison system last year by administrators. Wasko has said the company left voluntarily to avoid adhering to newer, stricter security protocols. 
The Future Fund, which Rhoden is tapping to provide money for the training program, is supported by a surcharge on employer payroll taxes. State law says the fund is for “purposes related to research and economic development for the state.”
Some of former Gov. Kristi Noem’s uses of the fund were controversial. That included money to build a state-owned shooting range that the Legislature refused to fund, a workforce recruitment ad campaign starring Noem, a “Governor’s Cup” rodeo that included Noem carrying in the American flag on horseback, and a fireworks display at Mount Rushmore.

,California,2025-06-24 00:11:44+00:00,CalMatters,State workers get a reprieve from Newsom’s return-to-office mandate,Adam Ashton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/return-to-office-pecg/,Gov. Gavin Newsom in May announced that he wanted state workers in the office four days a week. One union negotiated a pause on that policy.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom in May announced that he wanted state workers in the office four days a week. One union negotiated a pause on that policy. 



Gov. Gavin Newsom is open to giving California public employees a temporary break on his return-to-office mandate.
The union representing about 14,000 state engineers today announced a deal that would delay Newsom’s order that they return to work four days a week for one year. It was supposed to take effect July 1.
The Professional Engineers in California Government disclosed that agreement alongside a new contract that includes some concessions Newsom wanted to trim payroll expenses as he tries to shore up a $12 billion budget deficit.
Workers represented by the union will get a 3% raise next week, but it will be offset by mandatory unpaid time off that would basically negate the pay increase for two years. Additional raises will take effect in 2027. That’s similar to the terms of a deal Newsom made last week with the union representing state prison guards.
“The package includes two pay raises and an immediate halt to the four-day return-to-office order for our members. In this budget environment, those are important achievements,” union executive director Ted Toppin said in a written statement.
Governors often grant similar perks to different labor organizations, and that history suggests many other state workers could get a one-year reprieve from the full return-to-office mandate.
Newsom embraced telework policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and unions negotiated work-from-home stipends for public employees. Many of them felt they were as productive as ever, and they were happy to avoid expensive transportation and parking costs.
Newsom brought public employees back to the office twice a week last year, and ordered a bigger move to four-days-a-week in May.
As of May, about 108,000 state employees worked from home at least one day a week, the state human resources director told lawmakers at a recent hearing. 
The engineers union was one of several that contested Newsom’s mandate, including filing a lawsuit against the governor in Sacramento Superior Court. The union agreed to drop the lawsuit in its new agreement with Newsom.
Lawmakers have taken unions’ side, writing a letter earlier this month that urged Newsom to push back the mandate and grilling Newsom’s representatives in May over what they considered to be thin details on what the change would cost and how it would be implemented. 
“This is pretty bewildering,” Democratic Assemblyman Matt Haney of San Francisco said at the May hearing. “So is this, is this supposed to go into effect for everyone on July 1st and that everybody would be expected to come back four days on that day?”
Contracts for five more public employee unions are scheduled to expire next week. The largest labor organization in state government, Service Employees International Union Local 1000, announced that it filed a legal challenge over the return to office mandate last week. It represents about 100,000 workers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/072219-Oakland-Traffic-AW-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C665&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-23 20:59:36.265630

Filed earlier this month by the Montana Family Foundation, the lawsuit alleges the full text of the amendment should have been printed on the ballot instead of just a summary of the proposed Constitutional amendment.
It alleges that voters who registered on Election Day were particularly harmed because they don’t receive the voter guide distributed in advance by the Montana Secretary of State’s Office — which includes the “complete text” of any Constitutional amendment.
In November 2024, Montana voters supported CI-128 to enshrine abortion into the Montana Constitution with 58% approval. The amendment also prevents the government from penalizing patients or providers.
But plaintiffs Hannah Rhodes and Joe Addy, who registered to vote on Election Day, and the Montana Life Defense Fund, are asking the Montana Supreme Court declare the outcome null and void, alleging the submission of CI-128 to voters was “constitutionally deficient (and) procedurally unsound.”
The Montana Family Foundation filed the case on June 9 directly with the Montana Supreme Court and asked it to accept jurisdiction given “urgency factors,” with the amendment to be enacted July 1.
“Make no mistake: This is a battle for the soul of Montana,” the Family Foundation said in an email to supporters. “If CI-128 stands, it will open the floodgates to unrestricted abortion and strip Montana of its ability to protect innocent life.”
The language of the initiative prohibits the government from denying or burdening the right to abortion “before fetal viability.”
The lawsuit was filed against the State of Montana, and last week, Republican Attorney General Austin Knudsen filed a notice on behalf of the state agreeing the state Supreme Court should take up the case, which he argued “presents issues of statewide importance.”
However, supporters of CI-128 requested to intervene in the case, arguing no one else in the case will represent their interests.
“The State of Montana forced proponents to litigate at every turn to protect Montanans’ constitutional initiative power,” they said in court documents.
The proposed intervenors are Dr. Samuel Dickman, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, ACLU of Montana, and Forward Montana. They are represented by the Graybill Law Firm and ACLU of Montana.
“Proponents have an incontrovertible interest in defending the validity of CI-128 against Petitioner’s claims,” the group wrote in court documents. “Proponents drafted the petition, collected the signatures, prepared the ballot statement, and advocated for passage of the initiative.
“If this action were ‘dispos(ed) of’ in Petitioner’s favor, it would undo all of Proponents’ work, effectively reversing the results not only of the pre-election litigation but also a statewide election.”
This week in a court filing, the Montana Family Foundation said it did not object to participation by the intervenors given the position of the state, and it suggested “substantive briefing” could be helpful in the case.
It said the Montana Constitution requires “the full text of any proposed constitutional amendment to be submitted to the qualified electors on the ballot — not merely a short title, explanatory summary, or attorney general’s statement.”
The Montana Secretary of State publishes a voter information pamphlet, including the complete text of any Constitutional amendment, but that booklet is only distributed to registered voters on an active voter list “not later than 45 days before the election,” said the Montana Family Foundation in its petition.
That means Election-Day registrants don’t get those pamphlets, the plaintiffs said: “In other words, this class of qualified electors are deprived of the same opportunities to cast more-informed ballots compared to registered, active voters who appear on a county’s voter registration list more than 45 days prior to the election.”
As such, the Montana Family Foundation said the failure to include the full text of the amendment on the ballot violates the equal protection clause of the state and U.S. constitutions.
“As an Election-Day registrant, Rhodes was forced to cast a ballot without having an opportunity to read, evaluate or analyze the full text of CI-128,” said the court filing.
In a joint statement, supporters of CI-128 who asked to intervene in the case said they would continue to fight for access to abortion.
The statement was issued by ACLU of Montana Executive Director Akilah Deernose, Forward Montana Executive Director Alice Boyer, and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana CEO and President Martha Fuller.
“Everyone deserves the privacy and compassion to access the abortion care they need,” they said. “Montana voters agreed and made an informed decision when they decisively enshrined their right to abortion in the State Constitution.
“Anti-abortion extremists are showing a desperate display in an attempt to outright ignore the will of Montanans to enforce their unpopular, dangerous political agenda. We know that they will try anything to ban abortion — we, alongside our supporters, remain committed to fighting for Montanans and their families, and medical privacy free from government interference.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1422564336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 20:02:31.128433

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)As state-level elected officials met with cabinet secretaries appointed by Donald Trump at the Western Governors Association’s annual meeting on Monday afternoon, hundreds of demonstrators protested outside, their chants of “not for sale” echoing through downtown Santa Fe.
A coalition of hunters, fishers, mountain bikers, rock climbers, skiers, hikers, campers, wildlife lovers and more marched to the conference venue from nearby DeVargas Park, where the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance hosted a rally to oppose a Republican tax and spend proposal that would make more than 21,000 square miles of public land in New Mexico “eligible” to be sold to private buyers, according to a recent analysis.
New Mexico State Police unsuccessfully tried to stop the crowd from completely blocking West San Francisco Street and the entrance to El Dorado Hotel, where U.S. cabinet secretaries and state and territorial governors were gathered. Earlier in the day, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had given a keynote address to conference attendees, with no mention of the GOP proposal.
“This land is sacred, this land belongs to all of us, the water belongs to all of us,” Santa Clara Pueblo Gov. James Naranjo said at the rally. “They don’t belong to rich millionaires, they belong to the people of New Mexico and our visitors that come a long way to see our beautiful state, our beautiful culture, our beautiful ways of life.”
Speakers at the rally also opposed the Trump administration’s review of national monument protections, including buffer zones around Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
“Please support us tribes,” Naranjo told the crowd. “We’re fighting for Chaco Canyon, we’re fighting for Bears Ears, Tent Rocks, Puye Cliffs, Bandelier, Valles Caldera. All our national parks are in jeopardy.”

Teresa Martinez, executive director and co-founder of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition, said when people stand up for the land, they also stand up for each other. She said 100 years from now, future generations need to know that the right people stood up at the right time to protect cherished natural landscapes.
“Because if we don’t do it, the wrong people will,” she said, gesturing to the hotel where the governors were meeting with Trump officials. “The people in that room are the wrong people, and they’re trying to do it right now.”
Lauren Leib, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 340, which represents federal Bureau of Land Management workers in New Mexico, called on all of the state and federal officials at the conference to stop the tax and spending legislation going through Congress called the “one big beautiful bill.”
“They’re using this rationale to propose selling off millions of acres of our public lands to offset the massive tax breaks for the 1%, and they’re doing that under the guise of creating affordable housing,” Leib said. “That’s now how you solve the housing crisis.”
Instead, she said, policymakers should enact rent control, living wages and regulations of the rich who can afford to buy up housing.
“They’re trying to steal your public lands to line their own pockets out of insatiable greed, and utter disdain for working class people like you and me,” she said.
Also during the rally, more than 100 nonprofit organizations delivered a letter to the 19 state leaders at the WGA conference, urging them to oppose the federal legislation. The letter warned that the proposal would allow an unprecedented disposal of public lands “with no environmental review, meaningful Tribal consultation, or public input.”
“It will take effect with lightning speed, forcing the immediate nomination of lands put up for auction within 30 days, all with no public process,” the letter states. “There are no requirements or safeguards that sold land be used for affordable housing. It’s an attack on the very values Westerners hold dear.”
Naranjo placed the struggle over public lands in the context of his people’s struggles against colonialism.
“We fought off the Spaniards. We fought off the U.S. government,” he said. “We fought off a lot of people in our day, my ancestors, and we’re still here.”

,DC,2025-06-23 23:37:01+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,'None of us are tired': Democratic AGs pledge extended court fight against Trump,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/none-us-are-tired-democratic-ags-pledge-extended-court-fight-against-trump,,"WASHINGTON — Democratic state attorneys general vowed Monday on Capitol Hill to continue legal challenges against President Donald Trump’s “outrageous overreach” through executive orders to strip birthright citizenship, impose staggering global tariffs, thwart lifesaving medical research and more.Attorneys General Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Matthew J. Platkin of New Jersey, Andrea Campbell of Massachusetts and Kwame Raoul of Illinois spoke before Democrats on both the Senate and House Judiciary committees during a special “spotlight forum” hosted by minority party lawmakers.The top state law enforcement officers and their other blue state counterparts have mounted legal challenges against Trump’s directives they argue threaten their states’ economies and deprive constituents of their rights.The lawmakers have racked up wins in the federal courts to reinstate the jobs of fired federal workers, restore congressionally appropriated funding for health initiatives and nonprofits and protect citizenship for babies born in the United States to all parents, including immigrants.Trump, his administration officials and rank-and-file Republicans have attacked federal district judges on social media for rulings they didn’t like, and are mulling legislative action to yank power from the judiciary.“We’ve been punching above our weight and playing a vital role in this moment,” Campbell said.More than 20 Democratic state AGs are now awaiting the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion on whether it will uphold the states’ lower court victories protecting birthright citizenship.30 lawsuitsRep. Jamie Raskin, top Democrat on the House Committee on the Judiciary, praised the AGs for their role among the hundreds of lawsuits challenging Trump’s unilateral actions.The administration is facing 328 lawsuits from any number of plaintiffs, and at least 30 from Democratic state AGs, according to Raskin’s count. Numerous trackers online keep pace with the latest developments in the dozens upon dozens of cases launched since Trump began his second term.“Federal courts across the land have remarkably issued 197 preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders against this reign of lawlessness,” Raskin, of Maryland, said.Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, blamed Trump’s executive orders for “having damaging effects on the rights, liberties and pocketbooks of everybody.”“In this disturbing environment, many Americans have no greater ally than their states’ attorneys general,” said Durbin, of Illinois.Those on the panel told the lawmakers that standing up for Congress has been “at the core” of many of their legal challenges.“When we say he can't act like a king, it means he can't take actions that you have done and (were) signed into law by a president, and decide on a whim that he wants to, say, convert a Department of Transportation highway program into an immigration enforcement program,” Platkin said, referring to a June 19 victory for 20 Democratic-led states whose federal transit dollars were threatened.  Ellison said Trump’s orders that threaten states’ federal funding are “bullying, plain and simple.”“We will endure. This committee can count on state AGs, the ones who believe in liberty and justice for all, to continue to fight. None of us are tired, and we can do this longer than they can do this,” Ellison said.Medical research hitFor roughly two-and-a-half hours, Democratic lawmakers discussed the ways their constituents could be or have been harmed by Trump’s record number of executive orders since Jan. 20.Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania thanked the AGs for “working on behalf of all Americans to hold this administration accountable.”Scanlon, who represents the Philadelphia area, said her district was particularly impacted by Trump’s order to pull federal medical research dollars, including widespread funding from the National Institutes of Health.“My constituents are reporting a whole range of negative consequences. … Participants are being told they can no longer receive the treatment, that for many, was their last best hope. Accomplished research personnel are being laid off, threatening their livelihoods, and kneecapping our medical sector's ability to innovate,” Scanlon said.Rep. Deborah Ross, whose district includes North Carolina’s “Research Triangle” — the location of three major research universities in Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill — thanked Campbell for her role in a legal victory to restore NIH funding.Ross recalled a woman in her district reaching out to her office asking when a medical study she was part of would begin again.“When you guys get these amazing injunctions, you have to show both that the Trump administration has violated the law, likelihood of success on the merits, and you have to show irreparable harm. And just this woman who I got a message from is a demonstration of this irreparable harm,” Ross said.Illinois state Attorney General Raoul lamented that his GOP counterparts have not joined the lawsuits, particularly on health funding. Raoul told the panel that his father, a doctor, had died of prostate cancer. Years later, Raoul received a similar diagnosis but survived.“We should continue to advance in research. When we decided to take action on this, it's a very personal one to me,” Raoul said.“This does not just impact us in blue states, right? There are research institutions in the red states that are impacted as well. I would wish, I beg upon my colleagues who serve as AGs on the other side of the aisle to join us in this fight, because their institutions would otherwise suffer as well.”",,,,2025-06-23 20:02:31.128433

(Photo by Al Drago/Getty Images)In the Georgia political world, reaction to U.S. military attacks against three nuclear sites in Iran fell mostly, but not entirely, along party lines.
President Donald Trump announced the strikes Saturday night, calling them “a spectacular military success.”
The intervention into the war between Iran and Israel stoked fear of reprisal against U.S. military bases in the Middle East or terrorist attacks at home, but Trump and his allies said the strikes will prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
On Monday, Iran launched a retaliatory missile attack on a U.S. base in Qatar. Initial reports said U.S. air defenses intercepted the missiles and no casualties were reported.
Georgia GOP mostly backs strikes
  Gov. Brian Kemp. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Gov. Brian Kemp praised the U.S. bombings in an online post.
“America can never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. Thank you to President Trump, our service members and intelligence personnel, and administration officials who conducted this successful operation.”
Kemp later added that he and other governors around the country are in communication with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to discuss threats of retaliation.
“We are coordinating with law enforcement on all levels as we closely monitor any possible threats,” Kemp said.
In March, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified before a congressional committee that the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.”
Another U.S. assessment found that Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon and that, if they started making one, it would take them up to three years to complete it, according to CNN.
Most of Georgia’s Republican representatives in Congress followed the same formula: thanking Trump, thanking the troops and stating that Iran cannot be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons.
The exception was Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Rome. In a series of posts, Greene characterized the attacks as representing a return to the GOP’s neoconservative wing and its support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and away from Trump’s campaign promises of avoiding expensive and deadly foreign entanglements.
“Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” Greene said. “There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if (Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin) Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first. Israel is a nuclear armed nation. This is not our fight. Peace is the answer.”
Greene’s take puts her at odds with the majority of her party, said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock.
“She’s maybe still stuck on that page where Trump supporters and Trump himself were not in favor of regime change, certainly, and wanting to concentrate on making America great again, not worrying about what’s happening in the rest of the world,” he said. “So she is still in that mode, it sounds like, while Trump has moved on, and for most Republicans, if Trump moves on, they move on with him.”
Bullock said Greene’s anti-war statements are not likely to hurt her in the ruby red northwest Georgia district or damage her relationship with Trump, but if the U.S. does become engaged in a major war, Georgia Republicans could have to answer for their support.
“A year from now, as we’re looking at the 2026 election, if the U.S. is an active participant – certainly if we have troops on the ground who are in harm’s way – that does make this an issue that Republicans are going to have to defend themselves on, where up until this point, they’ve been pretty consistent in indicating that they would not want to see the U.S. become involved in somebody else’s war,” Bullock said
The Georgia House of Representatives issued a resolution Monday praising Trump, Israel and the strikes in Iran, as well as honoring Georgians who have died in conflicts in the Middle East. A total of 100 lawmakers signed the resolution, including nearly all Republicans and one Democrat, state Rep. Esther Panitch of Sandy Springs.
Democrats mostly oppose strikes
Georgia Democrats characterized the attacks as reckless and argued Trump should have sought congressional approval before approving them.
The Constitution grants Congress the authority to declare war, but presidents from both parties have deployed troops without formal declarations of war.
Sen. Raphael Warnock invoked the specter of the Iraq War.
“President Trump, who has said he ‘might or might not’ bomb Iran and has indicated this week that he disagrees with the assessment of his own national intelligence advisers, has now entered another Middle East conflict,” Warnock said. “He has not sought congressional approval and has not sufficiently explained why this operation was necessary right now. With thousands of American troops at risk for potential retaliation, this is not ‘the art of the deal.’ This is war. And this is not the first time the American people have been told that it will end quickly.”

Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year, was measured in his response, which was only two sentences.
“I pray for the safety of U.S. military servicemembers deployed around the world and express my admiration for their courage and professionalism,” Ossoff said in a statement following the strikes. “Congress must be promptly and fully briefed on tonight’s operation and consulted on the Administration’s strategy.”
Panitch, the state’s only currently serving Jewish legislator and a staunch supporter of Israel, celebrated the bombings on social media, arguing that a nuclear-armed Iran would be a danger to the Jewish state.
“When someone tells you they want you dead, have acted on it over the last 40 years, and have the ingredients to do it, you don’t wait until the warhead has been launched to protect yourself,” she said in a post.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum acknowledged the importance of public land in the west during remarks to the Western Governors’ Association on Monday, but did not address the prospect of 250 million acres of Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service land becoming eligible for sale under the proposed federal budget making its way through Congress.
GOP bill makes 14 million acres of public land in NM ‘eligible’ for sale, according to new analysis

Nor did any of the western governors ask him about the Congressional Republican proposal when Burgum took their questions. The secretary did not take questions from the media and, as of publication, press availability with him had not been announced.
Originally scheduled to speak later in the day, Burgum instead swapped places with Education Secretary Linda McMahon. A protest against the sale of public lands timed to Burgum’s original speaking time proceeded as planned.
Former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a Democratic candidate in New Mexico’s 2026 governor’s race, released a statement Monday denouncing the GOP proposal and said Burgum “should answer to New Mexicans while he visits our state and explain why he prioritizes corporate greed over New Mexico’s wellbeing.”
In his remarks, Burgum, a former governor of North Dakota, noted his belief that “the only people that should ever be head of Interior are people who’ve already been a western governor,” and noted that states such as New Mexico, Montana and Wyoming—to name a few—“are more than geographic destinations.” They aren’t “snow globes,” he said. “One of my messages here to all of you today is one of abundance…you can have amazing national parks, national historic sites, national monuments, you can work collaboratively with the tribes…and you can still contribute mightily to the nation’s economy and the nation’s security.”
Burgum returned to the theme of “abundance” in remarks about energy and what he characterized as the United States’ over-dependence on China for “critical minerals.” That “lopsided” dependence, he said, works against environmental concerns, contending that “if you care about the environment, do it in the U.S., because we do this stuff cleaner, smarter and safer than anyone. So, energy dominance is about us…having affordable energy to power all Americans.” Having “low-cost, affordable reliable energy,” he continued “drives everything home…because it keeps inflation down for every single production. There isn’t a product you wear, there isn’t a product that you eat, there isn’t a product that you drive, there isn’t a home that you live in that doesn’t have an energy component already in it.”

President Donald Trump upon taking office issued an executive order prioritizing mineral mining on federal lands and opening the door to rescinding existing bans.
While WGA emphasizes the bipartisan nature of its organization, Burgum alluded to outside tensions, arguing that “part of the divisiveness in our country is getting people to believe that everything is scarce, and if we do A, then we can’t do B, or if we do B, we can’t do A. We just have to get an abundance mindset, and we have to understand that innovation will solve any problem that we have.”
Specifically, he homed in on artificial intelligence, which he said is “going to change every job, every company and every industry. It would be impossible for me to overhype this in any possible way.”
Technological advances “extends human capability” such that “we’re at this tipping point where we now have the ability to actually solve all of our problems and stop living in a world where everything is a trade-off.”
But this vision can only come to pass if America has enough energy, Burgum said, and at present “our grid is at great risk.” Rolling blackouts and rolling brownouts during peak summer and peak winter are possible, he said, not because of climate change or the environment, but because you “can’t run a grid if the majority of your energy source is intermittent.” For instance: “The sun goes down at night,” thus, “there’s no solar production at night in this country.”
On the other hand, he said, in about 10 years, “the advancements coming in nuclear will produce clean energy in unlimited forms.” Burgum noted four executive orders Trump signed in May aimed at expediting approval of nuclear reactors, among other goals.
Hence, he said “the existential threat that we are facing is not one or two degrees of climate change in 2100, because we’ll solve all that… in the next decade or two by the innovation that will be provided if we can cut the red tape and have enough energy to drive AI and have enough energy to sell to our friends and allies, so they can stop buying from our adversaries.”
Outgoing WGA Chair New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham recently announced a $1 billion geothermal plant in the state and attended an energy summit in Alaska. In her question to Burgum about the role western states can play, she noted that New Mexico “continues to have huge opportunities for energy production, everything from fossil fuels to small-scale nuclear.” Western governors want to “help demonstrate” the ability to deploy “effective clean energy across the spectrum.”
Burgum noted that the strategy in New Mexico and other Western states is one of “energy abundance” and an “understanding it’s not an energy transition.”
New Mexico does, in fact, have an Energy Transition Act that sets zero-carbon goals for the coming decades.
“There is no transition,” Burgum continued. “It’s energy addition. We need everything we have, and then we need a lot more of it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DougBurgum-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 20:02:31.128433

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Witness testimony began in Denver District Court on Monday in a whistleblower lawsuit over whether Gov. Jared Polis broke state law by ordering state employees to produce information for a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoena.
During that testimony, a state official said that Polis’ office has not provided assurances to the state’s Department of Labor and Employment that it will investigate how federal authorities intend to use the requested data — for the child welfare purposes laid out in the subpoena or for immigration enforcement such as deportation.
Scott Moss, director of the state Division of Labor Standards and Statistics in CDLE, sued Polis, a Democrat, earlier this month over the governor’s direction to comply with the ICE subpoena. It sought personal information about people who house and care for unaccompanied immigrant children, known as sponsors. Sponsors are often family members who care for the children while they await deportation proceedings.

The April subpoena sought employer information, unemployment filings and Family and Medical Leave Insurance program records from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment about 35 sponsors, with the stated goal of ensuring the children were properly cared for and weren’t being exploited.
The governor’s office decided in late May that it wanted CDLE to produce and deliver the information.
CDLE director Joe Barela testified he was not aware of any specific criminal investigation tied to the information sought by the ICE subpoena or evidence of children in danger.
“I don’t think there was evidence. I think that if there possibly could be a chance that these sponsors had children in their care that weren’t accounted for or could possibly be exploited or involved in trafficking, that we didn’t want to prevent an investigation from finding that out,” he said.
But Moss alleges that disclosure of that type of personal identifying information violates a 2021 state law that generally prohibits state employees from sharing personal identifying information for federal immigration enforcement unless it is part of a criminal investigation. That law was updated and expanded this year. It passed the Legislature and was signed into law as exchanges over the subpoena played out in the background.
The subpoena uses the language “criminal purposes” and is labeled as an “immigration enforcement subpoena.”
“That should have been rationale enough to stop and ask questions,” said Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the 2021 and 2025 bills.
Polis’ lawyers contend that the subpoena was specific and pertained to potential human trafficking and a related criminal investigation, not immigration enforcement.
“Am I going to believe you or my own lying eyes? When I read that, it doesn’t say it’s for the purpose of a criminal investigation. This is posited as a welfare check,” District Judge A. Bruce Jones said in a back and forth with Polis attorney Thomas Rogers III.
Barela outlined a meeting in late May between him, members of the governor’s office and members of the attorney general’s office to deliberate whether to comply with the subpoena. He said the consensus following that meeting was that they would not be in violation of the 2021 state law if they handed over the requested information.
“I do think people were still uncertain, but I think they were reassured after that meeting that there was the attorney general and governor’s office supporting (us) and we were aligned in doing our job,” he said.
Polis’ lawyers have argued that Moss, as well as the two labor unions and nonprofit that have joined the lawsuit, does not have legal standing, because Moss did not have to comply with the order to produce the requested data and wouldn’t have faced repercussions. Barela testified that he could be the one to ask CDLE staff to get the information and that his conversations with Moss over legal concerns were in pursuit of a solution to run the 35 names through the department database.
“It’s very difficult to say ‘No’ when your direct supervisor, who is in charge of your hiring, firing and performance evaluations, asks you to do something. It’s a very intimidating environment, and we see employees retaliated against in a variety of ways,” said Diane Byrne, president of Colorado WINS, the union representing over 27,000 state workers.
Testimony will continue on Tuesday afternoon. Jones will then decide whether to block Polis’ directive to comply with the ICE subpoena.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is co-leading a coalition of 21 attorneys general in support of two lawsuits filed in May by National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) against President Donald Trump. 
The lawsuits challenge Trump’s May 1 executive order which targets “taxpayer subsidization of biased media” and argues that public funding of these media outlets is “not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.” 
Neronha and the attorneys general have a different take.
“Public media is a public good,” states the 41-page amicus brief filed Friday. “That good is even more valuable at the local level, where newsworthiness, reach, and financial incentives often do not align.”
“NPR and PBS are American institutions responsible for delivering emergency information, educational programming, and reliable news, all of which Americans use to inform how they live their lives,” Neronha said in a Friday statement. “These massive cuts would have dramatically negative impacts on the flow of public information, especially in rural and tribal areas, with potentially life-threatening consequences.”
Trump’s directive would terminate both direct and indirect federal funds for NPR and PBS, and “cancel existing direct funding to the maximum extent allowed by law,” according to the order text. 
The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and all other federal agencies to cancel grants and any other lingering financial support by June 30. The order argues that the Corporation has failed to abide by federal law by subsidizing the national networks and their affiliates, which Trump claims do not meet a standard of “fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”
The two lawsuits challenging Trump’s order were filed separately, with the first arriving on May 27 from NPR and three Colorado public radio stations — including the tribal-serving KSUT. The second lawsuit came on May 30 and was filed by PBS and a Minnesota affiliate. Both lawsuits argue that the threatened funding exceeds presidential authority, and erodes the information infrastructure needed for emergency alerts and local news.
The amicus brief filed Friday is co-led by the attorneys general of Colorado, Arizona, and Minnesota, plus Neronha. An additional attorneys general from 17 states, plus the District of Columbia, signed the brief. 
The brief details how emergency notification systems often rely on public broadcasters as primary or secondary venues to deliver emergency messages, Amber Alerts for abducted children, Silver Alerts for older people or people with disabilities who are missing, and other kinds of notifications. The broadcasters’ infrastructure can also serve as backups for notifications about electrical and internet outages, as they “often have hardened and resilient infrastructure that allows them to continue broadcasting during emergency situations,” the brief states.
The brief also argues for public media as an essential educational resource and lifeline for rural and underserved communities who may lack reliable access to broadband internet or non-free news sources. 
“Public media connects millions of Americans,” the brief reads. “It touches life’s ordinary and extraordinary moments, from school lessons in the living room to life-saving emergency alerts in the midst of a storm. … Losing public media would erode that trust and leave many American communities in the dark.”
Joining the four co-leading states and the District of Columbia are attorneys general from the states of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.

(Photo courtesy of National Weather Service-Bismarck)A severe weekend storm that claimed three lives also caused devastating damage to North Dakota’s agriculture industry.
Total damage is still being assessed from the widespread storm, which included a tornado near Enderlin that killed residents Michael Dalton Dehn, 73, Katherine Ann Pfaff-Dehn, 73, and Marcario Machuca Lucio, 89.
On Monday, officials were learning more about the impact of multiple tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds, with gusts reported to the National Weather Service exceeding 100 mph.
“It went all the way from southwest of Dickinson and just rolled across the state in different areas where supercells popped up,” North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said. “And it may not have been continuous, but it was continuous enough.”
Gov. Kelly Armstrong declared the storms a statewide disaster on Saturday, activating the state’s emergency plan. He plans to tour the damage in eastern North Dakota this week.
Goehring said the total damage is still being assessed, but his office has received reports of extensive damage to farms including grain handling systems, grain bins, equipment and irrigation systems. He estimates the loss of grain storage to be tens of millions of bushels.
“The one thing I know with certainty is the amount of damage that was done to grain handling systems and just all of that is just tremendous,” Goehring said. “So many bins that were collapsed.”
He said he’s also heard reports of people losing cattle, livestock buildings and corrals.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

Much of the damage was caused by severe straight-line winds. Goehring said he talked to a spray pilot over the weekend who lost his hangar and found his plane about a quarter-mile away.
“He said the turbine, that’s a $500,000 motor,” Goehring said. “So these guys are experiencing some real significant losses.”
Damage to agriculture facilities or equipment should be reported through the North Dakota State University Extension System, Goehring said.
Lilly Bina, North Dakota State University Extension agent in Cass County, visited Enderlin and Page on Monday to make a record of the damage. Bina said she saw a lot of crushed bins and sheds, torn up trees and shredded fields.
“The crop is not looking very good,” she said.
A grain elevator in Page was mostly destroyed, she added.
“Hopefully there’s some government programs that can help everyone,” she said.
Goehring said the North Dakota Industrial Commission may be able to provide some relief while the state continues to tally up the damage with hopes that federal resources could become available. 
The North Dakota Department of Emergency Services is working with city, county and tribal emergency managers and rural electric cooperatives to assess the extent of the damage. As of Monday, the department did not have information about how many homes were affected.
More than 36,000 customers lost power during the storm, with about 3,250 still without power on Monday, the Department of Emergency Services said.
The American Red Cross was providing community support and planned to serve dinner in Page Monday night, Sue Thesenga, regional communications manager for the nonprofit.
She said multiple families have reached out for temporary housing and financial assistance. Assistance is available calling 1-800-RED-CROSS or visiting the Red Cross website.
The North Dakota Community Foundation has set up a storm relief fund. Financial donations will be provided to impacted communities and homeowners to assist with disaster recovery and unmet needs.
Local communities have also established fundraisers, including the Dakota Plains Credit Union in Enderlin, which will host a freewill donation meal and fundraiser on Tuesday evening.
Tina Bleecker, branch manager for the credit union, said her sister’s farm was hit by the storm and while the family remained safe, they lost several cattle and livestock buildings .
“Walking through their yard was like a movie. It was traumatizing.” Bleecker said. “It’s certainly a sight to behold around here with all the damage.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Attorneys who successfully challenged a bill passed by the 2023 Legislature which would have banned minors from receiving gender-affirming medical care in Montana, have asked a district court judge to award more than $1.4 million in attorneys fees and costs related to the case.
Attorneys, led by both the state and national American Civil Liberties Union, were successful in challenging Senate Bill 99 as unconstitutional. Missoula County District Court Judge Jason Marks found that the measure violated the constitutional rights including equal protection, freedom of speech and the right to privacy. A team of attorneys from across the nation successfully challenged the law, which was struck down and allows medical providers to still offer gender-affirming care to residents less than the age of 18.
Attorneys said they vindicated — or successfully challenged — the constitutional rights of their clients and other state residents, and should get attorneys fees under the “private attorney general” doctrine which says that parties which have to defend basic rights are entitled to attorneys fees when the state refuses to defend them.
“This litigation did not merely vindicate abstract constitutional rights — it immediately and effectively voided a statute that threatened the rights of some of Montana’s most vulnerable residents,” the court documents said.
Court documents, like those filed by the ACLU of Montana on Friday, also give a look at the time, effort and tactics used by both sides. In its court filing, the ACLU alleges that the court case was especially time consuming because of attempts by the Montana Attorney General’s Office to delay or slow the case, including making untimely motions, sending disorganized documents, or trying to include other third parties.
The Daily Montanan reached out to the Montana Attorney General Office’s with an opportunity to comment or offer its explanation, but officials did not respond to requests on Monday.
The attorneys fees include $1.3 million, plus an additional $86,523 in costs.
Marks had said in his ruling that the state failed on several different aspects of the case.
“The Legislature disregarded its constitutional limitations, and the Attorney General offered no substantive or constitutional interest in defense of these actions,” Marks said.
The ACLU and the plaintiffs said that because the Legislature, the Attorney General and the governor all agreed on the topic, it left the plaintiffs to stand up for themselves.
“Private enforcement (was) the only option for plaintiffs to protect their rights,” the new court filings said. “Without this lawsuit, SB 99 would have remained in effect despite its unconstitutionality.”
The new court documents also paint a picture of the state attorneys as either disorganized or meritless. For example, it opposed admitting out-of-state attorneys — something that is common practice — which ultimately slowed the case and caused additional attorney time justifying why Marks should allow several attorneys to work on the case while in Montana courts.
“The state elected to combine different types of discovery — interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission — within each set in a disorganized manner, with no apparent logical order,” the ACLU said.
They argue that the additional disorganization and procedural fights were tactics to delay the case, but also run up the attorney bills. The attorneys who originally signed on agreed to take the case pro bono.
The attorneys who worked on the case for the plaintiffs show rates varying from $350 to $500 per hour, which they said is reasonable for Montana work, and then offered a comparison when the Attorney General’s Office paid a $500,000 retainer to a Washington, D.C., law firm to defend a challenge to another Legislature-passed bill regarding the popular social media application, TikTok. Attorneys hired by the state were contracted at between $650 and $700 per hour.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Gov. Greg Gianforte last week finalized the largest portion of Montana’s biennial budget by signing House Bill 2, but he removed tens of millions of dollars citing concerns over spending.
The line-item vetoes — a power most governors have to remove specific items from spending bills — cut nearly $31 million from the more than $16.6 billion budget. In addition, the governor’s office announced six more individual bills Gianforte vetoed last week totaling another more than $22 million. 
“Montana taxpayers work hard for what they earn, and they expect us to be good stewards of the taxes they pay to fund state government, protecting them from unnecessary spending,” Gianforte wrote in his June 20 veto letter for House Bill 2, the omnibus spending bill that will fund the state for the next two years. “They’ve been at the front of my mind when considering the measures the Legislature passed and sent to me. They’re at the front of my mind again as I consider the budget.”
The governor’s vetoes mostly focused on new and expanded funding for educational, correctional and health-related services. 
Gianforte said the budget the Legislature passed — in a bipartisan but controversial manner, with all Democrats joining moderate Republicans in support — wasn’t as fiscally responsible as the one he proposed back in November, though the total price tag was similar. The budget represented a 2% increase over the previous biennium, though conservative Republicans decried it as a bloated “big government” budget.
An analysis of the final budget by the Legislative Fiscal Division on June 7 — before Gianforte’s final vetoes — indicated the state’s revenue and spending are in alignment for the next two years, but showed that expenditures will exceed revenues in 2028 and beyond. 
The future imbalance, which was expected to be much worse under earlier analyses prior to the governor vetoing individual pieces of legislation, led many conservative Republicans to vote against the budget bill, calling the spending spree “not sustainable.”
On the other side, Democratic leaders in the House denounced several of the governor’s final cuts for harming Montana families, such as a revenue stream for nonprofits that work with low-income families with children and a student loan repayment play for state nurses.  
“I’m really disappointed in the Governor’s line-item vetoes of HB 2. House Democrats worked hard this session to secure investments in making life more affordable for Montanans, but these are the items that Gianforte put on the chopping block,” House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, said in a statement. “Montana’s budget is a statement of our values, and with these cuts, Governor Gianforte is telling us loud and clear that his priorities are not with working families.”
Gianforte added that while the Legislature passed a balanced budget, it included unnecessary spending that he removed. 
Three line items GIanforte struck out were agency funding measures that he said officials indicated they did not need. He removed $346,557 from the Legislative Branch, $1.126,412 from the Department of Revenue’ Cannabis Control Division, and $29,702 from the Department of Commerce’s travel expense reimbursement fund. 
House Bill 2, as passed, contained funding for two individual measures Gianforte vetoed. House Bill 462 provided a $5 million investment to revise mathematics content standards that, according to the governor, the superintendent of public instruction said was unnecessary. He vetoed that measure, brought by Rep. Melissa Nikolakakos, R-Great Falls, in May. 
He also removed a line item that funded House Bill 551, providing $600,000 for school lunch funding to eliminate copayments for reduced-price school meals.
HB 2 created a $3 million student loan repayment program for nurses, licensed practical nurses and psychiatrists who work at state-run facilities, including the Montana State Hospital. Gianforte said that while the goal of the program to help recruit and retain behavioral health workers was a critical one, the prioritization of workers at the State Hospital was unnecessary. He also wrote in his veto letter that the Department of Public Health and Human Services had made progress in recruiting and retaining nurses “without offering a student loan repayment program, rendering this $3 million proposal unnecessary at this time.”
Two education programs — a $100,000 grant program for STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) and robotics programs for students, and a $640,000 funding increase for a value-added agriculture initiative — also received the axe, with Gianforte saying the funding was vague, with no definitive plans for use. 
The biggest items Gianforte cut from the budget included an $11 million provider rate increase for air ambulance providers, which he said was a “carveout” that helped one provider type while leaving out others; a $1.6 million rate increase for contracted correctional facilities, which he said was unnecessary after the Legislature had already approved a larger allocation for similar services; $1.8 million of increased funding for prerelease facilities, which Gianforte said “may be premature,” as the Department of Correction is still negotiating with prerelease centers; and a $6 million revenue stream intended to provide funds for nonprofit organizations that work with lower-income families, which he said amounted to a “raid” on an existing program. 
“Protecting taxpayers requires us to make tough decisions, prioritizing what is necessary over what would be nice to have,” Gianforte wrote in his letter. “With the nearly $31 million in line-item reductions included here … we have more responsible spending and a budget with a stronger ending fund balance.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Capitol_Night-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 20:02:31.128433

Lawmakers exempted abortion medications from new protections for off-label prescriptions. A judge will decide whether part of the law should be blocked before it goes into effect on July 1.
The post Will a new Wyoming law protect providers or limit abortions? It depends on which lawyer you ask. appeared first on WyoFile .","The same group of abortion rights advocates whose legal challenges have stymied past attempts to stop or limit abortion in Wyoming is seeking to block part of another new law.
That statute, which goes into effect July 1, codifies what is already a long-standing medical practice: that providers can legally prescribe U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for unapproved or off-label uses without fear of punishment from Wyoming licensing boards. But the new law exempts drugs intended to induce an abortion from those protections.
Abortion rights advocates worry the law “indirectly bans abortion medication by threatening physicians and pharmacists with disciplinary action for prescribing off-label use” of certain drugs that are commonly used for medication abortions. On Monday, they asked a judge to block enforcement of the part of the statute that pertains to abortion while their broader lawsuit against it and two other new abortion laws proceed through the courts.

State attorneys, who are defending all three of the laws, asked Judge Thomas T.C. Campbell to allow the off-label law to go into effect as written. They dispute that the law is another attempt to limit access to abortion medications in Wyoming. Instead, they contend it merely clarifies that the law would not supersede the Wyoming Legislature’s 2023 ban on abortion medications, which is on hold pending a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling expected later this year.
In the meantime, abortion remains legal in Wyoming.
Off-label prescriptions
Prescribing medications for off-label purposes — in other words, uses not approved by the FDA — is common practice and can be a valuable tool for health care providers. Drugs approved to treat one type of cancer might be prescribed off-label for another type of cancer. Or a doctor might, for example, prescribe propranolol, which is approved for treatment of high blood pressure, for some types of anxiety. A medication in a different dose than what is FDA-approved would also qualify as off-label use.
In 2023, the Wyoming Legislature considered a bill intended to offer protections for providers who prescribe off-label drugs. Then Rep. Sarah Penn, R-Lander, sponsored the bill in the wake of a COVID-era controversy over hydroxychloroquine, an FDA-approved malaria drug that some providers prescribed to treat the virus. Some of those doctors faced the prospect of disciplinary actions in other states for providing what critics said was misinformation about the drug.

Penn’s bill failed, but Rep. Gary Brown, R-Cheyenne, successfully brought back a similar measure this year. House Bill 164, “Medical prescriptions-off-label purposes,” codified the practice of prescribing off-label medications. But it specified those protections did not apply to schedule I or II controlled substances (such as heroin or fentanyl), gender care for children and medications intended to induce an abortion. 
The most common regimen of those abortion medications includes the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol. Typically, a patient takes mifepristone first, then misoprostol one or two days later, according to medical providers cited in the plaintiff’s court documents. Both drugs are used off-label for abortion care in some circumstances.
Old case, new challenge
Wyoming’s lone abortion clinic — Casper’s Wellspring Health Access — and a group of abortion rights advocates are already suing to challenge two other laws from the 2025 legislative session. One added more stringent restrictions on abortion clinics, while a second required ultrasounds and a 48-hour waiting period. 
In April, Judge Campbell blocked enforcement of those laws while the legal challenge proceeds. On Monday, both sides appeared virtually in Natrona County District Court to debate whether HB 164 should also be halted while the broader case plays out.

Like past court hearings, abortion rights advocates used a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution, which protects people’s rights to make their own health care decisions, to help make their case. That amendment allows the Legislature to determine “reasonable and necessary restrictions” when they protect general health and welfare, and was cited by Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens when she struck down a pair of 2023 abortion bans in November.
Exempting abortion medications from off-label protections is not reasonable or necessary for public health, and is therefore unconstitutional, plaintiff’s attorney Bethany Saul argued. Most abortions are performed with medications, and the evidence shows those drugs are safe and rarely produce serious complications. 
And yet, health care providers who prescribe abortion drugs would be singled out by HB 164 and exempted from its protections without good reason, Saul told the court. If the law goes into effect as it’s now written, she added, providers may not prescribe the proper medications for their patients due to fears they might face future disciplinary actions from state licensing boards.
“This is not just a perceived risk,” she said. “We are facing a real risk.”

Senior Attorney General John Woykovsky defended the law, arguing the plaintiffs were misinterpreting HB 164. Brown, the bill’s chief sponsor, included the abortion medication exemption not as a backdoor attempt at banning the practice, but rather to align his legislation with the medication abortion ban passed by lawmakers in 2023. 
That ban, while on hold, could go into effect if the Wyoming Supreme Court rules it constitutional. The state’s highest court heard arguments on that case in April and is expected to rule later this year. If the justices affirm a lower-court decision that the ban is unconstitutional, then the abortion medication exemption in HB 164 has no effect, Woykovsky argued. He disputed the idea that the new law would discourage providers from prescribing off-label use of the medications.
“As it stands now, there are no laws in place to prohibit the use of off-label drugs for abortions,” he said. “And there should be no chilling effect.”
Judge Campbell listened to about an hour of arguments from both sides. He did not rule at the hearing, but said he would issue a decision as soon as possible given the law will go into effect in just over a week.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas oil and gas regulators unanimously approved a second lithium royalty rate Monday during a special hearing in Magnolia.
The approval marks another stage in what officials and industry believe will be a lucrative industry extracting the mineral from South Arkansas’ subterranean brine, thousands of feet below the surface. Lithium is an essential element in batteries that power electric vehicles, equipment and cell phones.
Saltwerx, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, applied for the royalty last month, just days after the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approved an identical royalty for Standard Lithium and Equinor’s joint venture.
Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approves first lithium royalty rate

Exxon’s newly-approved royalty rate — 2.5% — and the broader royalty payment structure are identical to Standard Lithium’s. Much of the language in the application itself was also identical.
The royalty applies only to the Pine Unit, a geographical area encompassing parts of Lafayette and Miller Counties.
“We’re pleased that Arkansas has taken an important first step to help kickstart the domestic lithium industry,” an ExxonMobil spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “While this is just the beginning and the road ahead is complex, this can open the door to new economic opportunities, including jobs, investment, and long-term growth for the region.”  
This was its second royalty application.
Both Standard Lithium and ExxonMobil were two of the parties to the so-called “Big 5” royalty application that the commission unanimously shot down in November. The only difference between the November application, and the two applications the AOGC has now approved is the royalty rate. In the November application, it was 1.82%. In the two that have been approved this year, it is 2.5%.
The companies vying for the rights to the brines have said they plan to use a process called direct lithium extraction (DLE). The process would allow the companies to separate the lithium from the brine, which would eventually be turned into a variety of lithium products such as lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide. 
But before that extraction can begin, a royalty has to be paid to the owners of the mineral rights underlying the brine units. Se brine law says a royalty must be “fair and equitable,” and that a substance must be “profitably extracted” in order for a royalty to be paid. The commission determines if a company’s proposed royalty meets that bar. 
As in last month’s Standard Lithium-Equinor royalty hearing, few people objected during Monday’s hearing to Exxon’s proposed royalty. A number of entities submitted letters of support — primarily business groups and local governments that stand to benefit from lithium extraction in the area.
A group of property owners and mineral rights holders, the South Arkansas Minerals Association, objected to Exxon’s royalty application, as it has for the three previous royalty applications that have gone before the commission. 
Alan Perkins, attorney for the association, questioned the lack of financial information put forth by the company.
“It’s difficult to understand, for me, how we went from a hearing where we had a full feasibility study available and yet that wasn’t enough for the commission to make a decision, to where we are today, where we have a table with three or four lines and some very simple math,” Perkins said.
Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission receives ExxonMobil lithium royalty application

Exxon received a determination that it had the potential to profitably extract in April, when the regulator approved the formation of its Pine Unit — another requirement before a royalty can be determined. In November, commissioners said they had not received enough information to justify the 1.82% royalty rate, with one saying that the information they wanted would have to be provided during a unitization hearing anyway.
Six written objections, including the minerals association’s, were submitted to the commission prior to the hearing, according to the AOGC’s website.
Latwon Whitby of Forrest City, the only person to speak at the hearing other than Perkins, told commissioners it was “essential that our interests are protected.” 
He told the Advocate his family has owned mineral rights in the Pine Unit’s area for generations. He expressed frustration that Exxon insisted their royalty was “fair and equitable,” despite not, in his view, providing any evidence to back it up.
“It seemed to me that they were just wanting to get a project up and running so that they won’t go to another state,” Whitby said after the commission voted to approve the royalty. 
Prospective lithium extractors have raised the specter of taking their business to Texas or Louisiana on multiple occasions since last year, with Standard Lithium saying after the November hearing that Arkansas would lose its “first-mover advantage” if their royalty proposals weren’t given the green light.
“This decision reinforces the Commission’s commitment to fairness and consistency in Arkansas’s emerging lithium industry,” said Commission Chairman Jerry Langley in an emailed statement distributed by the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment. “By aligning with the structure approved last month for production in new areas of the state, we’re creating a reliable and competitive foundation for growth in this vital sector.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3601-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 19:03:11.550237

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)A massive sell-off of millions of acres of public lands is part of the federal “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” with at least one member of Montana’s federal delegation squarely in the thick of the discussion, and land in Montana apparently off the chopping block, at least for the time being. 
Back in late May, Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana stripped out a provision of the bill that would have sold 450,000 acres of land across the country and said in a press release: “This was my San Juan Hill; I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land.”
Public usage of public land is one issue unites people across the political spectrum in Montana and elsewhere.
More mass land sales were not being considered until the bill reached the U.S. Senate, and Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Mike Lee, R-Utah, added them in. The current bill calls for more than two million acres to be sold, with acreage identified across western states, but not Montana, according to one analysis.
On June 5, Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines’ office sent out a statement saying there had been “some confusion” about Daines’ position on the sale of public lands after reports were published that he was working with Lee regarding public lands. Daines’ press secretary Gabby Wiggins clarified in a statement, “Senator Daines always has, and always will be, against the sale of public lands. Senator Daines is holding discussions with his colleagues in the Senate and bringing up his strong concerns.”
She went on to say Daines’ stance was seeking to minimize or prevent public lands sales. It’s unclear what, if anything, Daines did on the issue.
In a letter to Senator Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, a coalition of outdoor businesses wrote it would have a “significant impact” on their industry.
“Unilaterally removing lands with recreational value from public ownership is a losing issue for the American public, businesses and many Republicans in Congress,” the letter reads.
Despite not being involved in the sale, groups in Montana have voiced their concerns, too.
“2 million acres of American public land on the chopping block? Theodore Roosevelt is spinning in his grave,” Frank Szollosi, executive director of the Montana Wildlife Federation said in a release. There is well established law dealing with surplus federal land divestment. This is a back room deal that cuts the American public out of the process.”
None of Montana’s federal delegation responded to a request for a comment from the Daily Montanan. It’s unclear why Montana has been excluded from the land sales, or if the state’s federal delegation influenced the exclusion.
Earlier in May, Zinke helped create a bipartisan public lands caucus, which fellow Montana Rep. Troy Downing is also part of. On Friday, two Idaho senators, both Republicans, came out against the land sales, as did Daines to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.
Daines and Sen. Tim Sheehy also supported a Democratic resolution against selling public lands earlier this year.
Significant chunks of federal land are at risk of sale. The proposal would require the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service to identify and sell from 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres of public lands across 11 Western states to build housing.



Data collected by The Wilderness Society, an environmental nonprofit, show how many acres of land are being considered for sale. About 2 to 3 million acres of land would be sold under the bill, though which of these tracts would be sold is unclear.

Mike DeWine. (Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Gov. Mike DeWine is concerned about “vulnerable” Ohioans and retaliation from Iran following the Trump administration’s strikes on its nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has joined Israel in its bombing of Iran.
“I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” Trump said during his address that evening. “Iran’s key nuclear facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.”
Now, Charlie Koenigsmark, a community organizer with the anti-racism group ANSWER Coalition, fears war.
“It was completely unprovoked and a war crime, that bypassed any consultation or approval from Congress,” Koenigsmark said.
We reached out to half a dozen Middle Eastern associations and Iranian and Persian groups, but none were available to comment by our deadline. One advocate told us they were worried about speaking publicly.
Trump said he is hoping the U.S. attack would be the start to peaceful negotiations with the Middle Eastern country, but defense officials confirm Iran fired missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar. That attack was intercepted, they said.
“It’s deeply upsetting,” Koenigsmark said about the possibility for war.
The state’s veterans services department told us that Ohio has more than 50,000 active duty military members, “any of whom could be pressed into a heightened military situation at any moment.”
Gov. DeWine was asked about the situation during a news conference Monday.
“Well, of course, the first thing we’re concerned about immediately is in Ohio, something that we can do something about,” DeWine responded. “Of course, we’re very concerned about that. [Department of Public Safety Director] Andy Wilson has been in contact with people who we think might be potentially vulnerable, so that was frankly our first reaction, first thing that we can do.”
Asked who is vulnerable, DeWine said he doesn’t have to spell things out.
“We always are concerned about any kind of retaliation and we don’t know.”
The U.S. needs to be united right now, he added, while also cautious.
“I think we all know that Iran and nuclear weapons are two things that should not go together, and the president took the action that he thought was appropriate,” the governor said, responding to a question about the legitimacy of the strikes.
DeWine, who served two terms in the U.S. Senate from 1995-2007, said that he doesn’t know why or how Trump made his decision.
“I do not have the intelligence that I would have had when I was in Congress and when I was on the Intelligence Committee, nor certainly do I have the briefings that the President of the United States has,” he continued. “He took the action.”
Many members of Congress have been telling reporters that they had been unaware until the strikes occurred.
“We don’t want U.S. military personnel to die just because Trump and [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu are set on expanding war and regional instability — global instability, really,” Koenigsmark said.
Koenigsmark predicted anti-war protests will be going on continuously this summer. He also offered that he thought Ohio’s role in military manufacturing and research is “horrible.”
The City of Lima has the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, a facility that makes army tanks and other combat vehicles. Dayton, the home of the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has a whole federal sector dedicated to aerospace defense.
In January, Governor Mike DeWine announced that Pickaway County, outside of Columbus, will be the home of a new manufacturing plant for Anduril Industries, a major U.S. defense contractor, to create weapons & drones.
One of the incentives to bring the factory to Ohio is that the company will be getting more than $450 million in state tax credits. Anduril and JobsOhio estimate that the plant will produce more than $2 billion in economic output.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A Utah college student arrested by federal immigration agents in Mesa County earlier this month was released Friday after what she called the “nightmare” of a 15-day stay in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora.
Caroline Dias Goncalves was detained by ICE in Grand Junction on June 5, shortly after being pulled over by a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy in a separate traffic stop, from which she was let go with a warning. The deputy has been placed on leave amid an internal investigation into whether a Signal message leading to Dias Goncalves’ arrest violated Colorado laws prohibiting cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE.
The University of Utah nursing student was then held at the ICE facility in Aurora, operated by private prison firm GEO Group, before being released on bond Friday evening, she said in a statement released through immigration advocates on Monday.
“The past 15 days have been the hardest of my life,” Dias Goncalves said. “I was scared and felt alone. I was placed in a system that treated me like I didn’t matter.”

A daily average of more than 1,100 people are held in the Aurora ICE detention center, the only such facility in Colorado. Dias Goncalves, who was born in Brazil and brought to the U.S. as a 7-year-old, described having to eat soggy food — “even the bread would come wet,” she said — and other dehumanizing treatment towards detainees in the facility.
“The moment they realized I spoke English, I saw a change. Suddenly, I was treated better than others who didn’t speak English,” her statement added. “That broke my heart. Because no one deserves to be treated like that. Not in a country that I’ve called home since I was 7 years old and is all I’ve ever known.”
ICE has not replied to questions from Newsline and other media outlets about Dias Goncalves’ arrest, which has sparked an outcry from national groups that advocate on behalf of “Dreamers,” young adults who lack permanent legal status after being brought to the U.S. as children.
“We are hurting our nation — and our very soul — when we target immigrant youth this way,” Gaby Pacheco, president of the advocacy group TheDream.US, said in a statement on Dias Goncalves’ release. “One traffic stop. One unlawful arrest. And a lifetime of trauma. Enough is enough.”
Tensions over immigration enforcement have risen across the country in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has directed ICE to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. That has included an order to the agency to meet an arrest quota of at least 3,000 people per day.
Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people taken into ICE custody despite having no criminal record — Dias Goncalves among them — has risen sharply since January.
Representatives for Dias Goncalves said she and her family were requesting privacy following her release. In her statement, she said she would try to “move forward” and focus on work and school, and directly addressed the ICE agent who detained her.
“He kept apologizing and told me he wanted to let me go, but his ‘hands were tied.’ There was nothing he could do, even though he knew it wasn’t right,” Dias Goncalves wrote. “I want you to know — I forgive you. Because I believe that people can make better choices when they’re allowed to.”

Politicians, scores of businesses, join rapidly growing criticism of budget measure targeting federally owned land in Western states.
The post Wyoming opposition intensifies against public land sell-off appeared first on WyoFile .","Opposition to a Republican plan to sell millions of acres of federal public land in the West intensified over the weekend, with politicians, individuals and scores of businesses criticizing the budget proposal.
The groundswell of opposition has grown beyond green groups, tree huggers and naturalists after the Wilderness Society published a map of the federal properties eligible for sale, including iconic western landscapes at New Fork and Green River lakes.
Eighty-five Wyoming businesses representing myriad entities from small-scale loggers to international brands called the proposed sell-off “a non-starter for Wyomingites and all Americans.” In letters to Republican U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, they said the state’s outdoor culture “is under threat by a concerted movement to transfer or sell federal public lands.”
Politicians, including former Wyoming Speaker of the House Albert Sommers, R-Pinedale, weighed in. The plan will affect “literally everyone in Wyoming, as well as out-of-state visitors our tourism industry depends on,” Sommers wrote Barrasso.
“Why do the lifestyles of 11 Western states have to bear the burden of paying national debt created by the other 39 states as well?” Tom Lubnau
Another former speaker warned that “billionaires and corporations, and perhaps foreign countries,” will be the successful bidders if the measure passes. Those rich and powerful entities will use their purchases to control public access, locking up public lands “tighter than a miser’s fist on a handful of pennies,” former Rep. Tom Lubnau, R-Gillette, wrote in an op-ed in the Cowboy State Daily.
The way the bill is written “will not benefit the people of Wyoming,” state Democrats in the Legislature said in a statement Friday. “We are strongly against,” the eight lawmakers wrote.
“The bill provides very little if any guardrails or transparency,” Rep. Mike Schmid, R-LaBarge, president and CEO of a well-services company, wrote in another opinion piece. “That should alarm every single American who values public access and national security.”
Teton County asked to be exempted from any sales.
“Disposal of public land in Teton County, as contemplated in the reconciliation bill, is much more likely to worsen our housing crisis rather than to mitigate or address our housing shortage,” county commissioners said in letters to Wyoming’s senators.
What it does
“The development of additional luxury homes, as almost certainly dictated by our real estate market, only creates more jobs and worsens the imbalance between local jobs and local houses that our workforce can afford.”
Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee’s proposed “mandatory disposal” of an estimated 2-3 million acres of land managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management would fast-track the sales. The measure, which is expected to be part of the Senate version of the “Big Beautiful Bill,” would purportedly cure the twin problems of scant affordable housing and the national deficit. Critics say the measure would fund tax breaks for the wealthy.
The provision targets 11 Western states and would bypass existing laws and regulations, like those of the BLM, that allow public-interest land sales “developed with public involvement and environmental analysis.” It would funnel land sales proceeds into the treasury instead of the agencies themselves, as existing laws mandate.
Lee’s proposal would require agencies to quickly — within 60 days and regularly thereafter — start accepting nominations from individuals and entities for tracts to be sold. It gives sales authority to the secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture departments.

The measure would prioritize sales of parcels nominated by state or local governments near existing development and suitable for housing. It does not require or ensure that housing would be or remain affordable. It would also allow land to be sold and used for infrastructure.
A provision that put checkerboard-area holdings on the priority list was dropped in a rewrite. WyoFile did not receive a response from the GOP staff on Lee’s Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee as to why checkerboard lands were first prioritized, then removed.
Lee’s measure originally excluded lands on which the agencies had issued grazing permits, an exemption that’s also since been removed, according to the National Wildlife Federation.
The measure would exclude from the sale protected lands such as national parks, wilderness areas and so on. It also excludes Montana. Critics say that’s an effort to curry favor with U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, who opposes the sale of public lands and whose budget vote is critical.
In letters to constituents, Barrasso and Lummis sought to quell fears.
“Please be assured,” Lummis wrote one resident, “it is one of my top priorities to maintain and improve public access on public lands for activities such as hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, hiking and biking.”
She wrote that state citizens could better control the property belonging to all Americans. “I believe that the people of Wyoming are the best stewards of the land, not unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.”
Barrasso said he supports federal land sales “when they serve the interests of states, local communities and the public.” What’s on the table would impact “less than one percent of our federal lands,” he wrote.
“I am committed to efficient multiple-use management of our public lands to ensure continued public access, healthy wildlife, and productive ecosystems,” he wrote. Contrary to analysis by the Wilderness Society and the National Wildlife Federation, Barrasso said he believes the measure would not allow the sale of land permitted for grazing.
Barrasso’s staff did not immediately respond to an inquiry Monday regarding how the senator’s Wyoming Range Legacy Act might conflict with the land sales provision.
In 2007, Barrasso fulfilled a promise to push the act previously championed by the late U.S. Sen Craig Thomas of Wyoming, by successfully withdrawing more than 1.2 million acres in the mountains between Afton’s Star Valley and Pinedale’s Upper Green River country from new oil and gas leasing. Now, however, much of that country is open to be nominated for sale, according to the Wilderness Society map.
Hageman attacks “ecoterrorist”
U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, another Wyoming Republican, lashed out at the Wilderness Society in a Cowboy State Daily opinion column published Friday.
“There has been an awful lot of misinformation in recent days,” Hageman wrote, with “a lot of the talk surrounding [Lee’s] efforts … misleading or flat out untrue.” She said the Wilderness Society was “the biggest culprit so far … working overtime to misrepresent what [Lee’s provision] actually does.”
The TWS map is “a fundraising rant, attempting to scare us,” she wrote, calling TWS president Tracy Stone-Manning a “hypocritical ecoterrorist,” and the interactive map “hogwash.”
The conservation group’s caterwauling, Hageman wrote, is “an effort to control these lands to ensure our amenities are used solely by the independently wealthy, who have little concern as to whether there is affordable housing available for the people who seek to make their lives in places like Kemmerer or Green River or Pinedale.”
But the map “accurately use[s] the exact criteria for eligible lands included in the most recent publicly available draft,” Wilderness Society Wyoming State Director Julia Stuble said in a statement Monday. “Broad sell-offs of public land are deeply unpopular in Wyoming and it is entirely understandable that laying out the lands eligible for sale in the bill, without exaggeration or bias, would elicit outrage.”
Lee’s provision is headed down a complex path in the Senate where it could be stricken, dropped, amended or adopted before the reconciliation bill moves back to the House. Meantime, former Wyoming Speaker of the House Lubnau wondered: “Why do the lifestyles of 11 Western states have to bear the burden of paying national debt created by the other 39 states as well?”

RUTLAND CITY — Hundreds of people over the weekend toasted to the smashing success of the Rutland County Pride festival at Bailey’s Place, a new bar and lounge space for LGBTQ+ residents in the Marble City. 
Approximately 6,000 people were expected to attend the Rutland County Pride event and around 500 people dropped by the bar, which opened in April, according to Bailey’s Place co-owner Faith McClure.
Bailey’s Place is only one of a handful of bars in Vermont founded for the purpose of creating a space for their local LGBTQ+ communities, according to McClure. In 2021, Fox Market and Bar in East Montpelier ended a nearly 15-year drought of LGBTQ+ bars in the state, and Foxy’s in Barre joined the slim ranks of Vermont’s LGBTQ+ bars in 2024.

The building for Bailey’s Place on Evelyn Street was briefly Prouty’s Parlor ice cream shop and before that housed the bars Strangefellows, which closed around the Covid-19 pandemic, and Shooka Dookas, which closed in 2006, according to McClure.
While Shooka Dookas and Strangefellows evolved into de-facto gay bars, Bailey’s Place is the first designated LGBTQ+ bar to open in Rutland City, McClure said. 
The 21-year-old owner said it was important for her to designate Bailey’s Place as an LGBTQ+ lounge in Rutland, as she hopes to create a space that is “all inclusive.” McClure said her stepfather and co-owner Fred Watkins helped rehabilitate the Bailey’s Place property, which occupies a historic building in Rutland City’s downtown near the train station. `
“There’s a lot of spaces downtown that I feel like could be revitalized to be welcoming community spaces like this,” McClure said. “I’ve had other queer people in the community come up to me, and they’ll say this to me directly going, ‘Oh, there’s not really a whole lot of spaces in Rutland. If there is the closest one is like, three hours away.’”

During Rutland’s Pride festivities over the weekend, the bar and lounge offered karaoke, a DJ and drag performances, along with food and drinks throughout Saturday night. McClure said 25% of the proceeds from sales of its cocktail special, a strawberry lemon drop, are set to be allocated to the Rutland County Pride Center. 
“People loved the performers over at Bailey’s. People were digging karaoke,” she said. “We were really happy that everyone had a good time.”
During the daytime Pride events, McClure also operated a Bailey’s Place booth along with dozens of vendors lining the streets of Rutland City’s downtown.
The festival organized by the Rutland County Pride Center kicked off with speeches from U.S. Rep. Becca Baliant, the first openly LGBTQ+ person to represent Vermont in Congress; Christine Halquist, the first transgender Democratic nominee for Vermont governor; Mia Shultz, the president of the Rutland County NAACP; and city officials.

McClure said people at the Pride festival were “pretty focused on the joy” of the day but that it’s important to celebrate Pride amid growing concerns over government actions limiting LGBTQ+ rights across the country.
“It lets people know that in these hard times with our country, with what the government’s doing with the rights of those in the LGBTQ+ community, that there are still people like Bailey’s who are going to be around for as long as the community will allow us to be,” McClure said. 
As the community for Bailey’s Place grows, McClure said her long-term goal is to expand or move into a bigger space to accommodate dancing and larger celebrations. In the meantime, McClure said she and her team have been working one day at a time to renovate the bar, refine the food and drink menu, and host trivia nights and other events to attract new customers. 
“It’s nice to know for the Rutland community that there’s something in your backyard,” she said.

A motion filed in federal court by the Department of Justice argues the law, which takes effect next month, is unconstitutional because it “deprives Catholic priests of their fundamental right to freely exercise their religious beliefs, as guaranteed under the First Amendment.” 
“The punishment for directly violating the sacramental seal of Confession is excommunication. A more direct burden on the exercise of religion would be difficult to imagine,” federal attorneys wrote in their motion to intervene in a case brought by Washington bishops last month.
That case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. 
At issue is Senate Bill 5375, which will take effect July 27. It adds clergy members to the state’s list of individuals legally required to report suspected child abuse to law enforcement or the Department of Children, Youth and Families.
Disclosures in confession or other rites where the religious leader is bound to confidentiality are not exempt. But under the law, clergy will retain their privilege to avoid testifying in related court cases or criminal proceedings.
Archbishop Paul Etienne of Seattle, along with Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima and Bishop Thomas Daly of Spokane, sued May 29 arguing the law violates their First Amendment right to practice religion free of government interference, and is religious discrimination because it will force priests to violate their sacred vows or face punishment by the state.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, Attorney General Nick Brown and the prosecuting attorney in each of Washington’s 39 counties are named as defendants. 
The Department of Justice is only seeking to sue the state and wants the federal court to bar enforcement of the law against Catholic priests who refuse to disclose information obtained in confession.
“The Justice Department will not sit idly by when States mount attacks on the free exercise of religion,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a press release. 
Attorney General Nick Brown declined to comment on the new filing.
“We will review this complaint and respond in court,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for the Attorney General’s Office.
Monday’s move isn’t unexpected. On May 5, the Department of Justice announced it had opened a civil rights investigation into the “apparent conflict” of the new law with “the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment.”
Ferguson, a Catholic, said when he signed the bill that requiring disclosures learned in confession did not give him pause.
Weeks later, when the legal fight began, the governor said he was “disappointed my Church is filing a federal lawsuit to protect individuals who abuse kids.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/church-windows-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-23 19:03:11.550237

(Photo via Getty Images Plus)A group of several businesses and organizations filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the new Iowa law putting regulations in place for pharmacy benefit managers, the companies negotiating prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and health insurance companies.
The lawsuit against the Iowa Insurance Commissioner was brought by the Iowa Association of Business and Industry, as well as Des Moines Orthopaedic Surgeons PC, Iowa Spring Manufacturing & Sales Co. and health plans the Iowa Bankers Benefit Plan, Iowa Laborers District Council Health and Welfare Fund. The suit against the state argues Senate File 383, signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds earlier in June, is unlawful and contradicts federal PBM regulations.
The law, supported by pharmacists and other rural health care advocates during the 2025 legislative session, restricts certain PBM business practices that supporters of the measure said coerce or force consumers to use certain pharmacies to fill prescriptions. These entities are banned from adding financial advantages or penalties for certain pharmacies when filling an order and setting different cost-sharing rates under the law. It also requires pharmacies to be reimbursed for the national or state average acquisition cost of a drug and establishes a $10.68 dispensing reimbursement fee for each prescription filled by independent and rural pharmacies.

While supporters said these provisions will help struggling pharmacies in many Iowa communities, several business and health insurance industry organizations have repeatedly criticized the measures as they will potentially raise the prescription drug and health coverage costs for Iowans. The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Des Moines argued the new law will “raise healthcare costs for businesses across the state – large and small – by tens of millions of dollars.”
The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to block enforcement of the law and for the court to rule the measure is unlawful.
In a news release on the lawsuit, ABI officials argued the measure was not only preempted by federal law on PBMs, but was unconstitutional by restricting free speech.
The measure could make it illegal for employers to tell their employees “about ways to save money, such as avoiding a $10.68 fee by using certain pharmacies,” according to the release.
“We’re challenging this new Iowa law because it’s going to raise health care costs for businesses of all sizes across the state by hundreds of millions of dollars,” ABI President Nicole Crain said in a statement. “It will also disrupt the prescription drug coverage that Iowans count on, and it even stops health plans from giving people simple, money-saving information, like which pharmacy has the better deal. That’s bad policy that goes against federal law and violates the First Amendment.”
Organizations like the Iowa Pharmacy Association and lawmakers backing the law repeatedly said claims the measure will significantly raise health care costs in Iowa are untrue, pointing to other states that have enacted similar measures without seeing dramatic increases in health insurance premiums.
Reynolds said in a statement when she signed the measure that it would address several PBM business practices that harm patients and small pharmacies, but said her administration will conduct ongoing review to assess the impacts of the law as it takes effect.
“The complexity and lack of verifiable data made signing this bill a difficult decision, and my administration will closely monitor implementation to mitigate and ensure that any unintended consequences for private employers are addressed,” Reynolds wrote. “We will also be launching a reverse auction to ensure Iowa’s state health plan continues to keep costs as low as possible for the state and its employees.”

(Kimbrell photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA. Wilson photo by John A. Carlos. Both are special to the SC Daily Gazette.)The race to be South Carolina’s next governor has officially begun.
Two Republicans — Josh Kimbrell, a state senator from the Upstate; and South Carolina’s longtime attorney general, Alan Wilson — formally announced their bids Monday in what promises to be a crowded run for the Governor’s Mansion in 2026.
Hours before Wilson was scheduled to make his formal announcement at an event in his home county of Lexington, Kimbrell made his campaign official in an e-mail blast. The Boiling Springs Republican will follow up with a launch celebration Saturday.
The pair of announcements comes a little less than a year ahead of the GOP primary, in a state where Republicans occupy all statewide offices, six of seven U.S. House seats, and a supermajority in both chambers in the Legislature. It’s been almost 20 years since a Democrat won any statewide office in South Carolina: Jim Rex narrowly won his bid in 2006 to become state superintendent of education.
Filing for the June 2026 primaries is still nine months away.
At least four other Republicans could launch a bid for governor before then. They include U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, of the coastal 1st District, who has been bashing her potential gubernatorial opponents for months, as well as Lt. Gov. Pam Evette, who is expected to make a decision within the next month, according to a consultant working with the Travelers Rest Republican.
Former state treasurer and reality TV star Thomas Ravenel announced a bid in early February but jumped back out four days later.
State Sen. Sean Bennett also continues to weigh a run. The Summerville Republican told the SC Daily Gazette he intends to evaluate the field of candidates “to see if the race needs me or if it doesn’t need me.” And U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman has told reporters he’ll make an announcement July 27.
Should Norman enter the governor’s race, state Sen. Wes Climer, R-Rock Hill, told the SC Daily Gazette he would consider a bid for to replace him in the 5th District, which includes the suburbs of Charlotte, N.C., and stretches from Spartanburg County southeast to Sumter County.
So far only one Democrat, state Rep. Jermaine Johnson, of Columbia, has said he is considering a run.
Who’s in
Of the two officially in the running, Wilson has spent that last 14 ½ years as South Carolina’s top prosecutor, making him the nation’s longest-serving attorney general. When first elected to the job in November 2010, he replaced his former employer, then two-term Attorney General Henry McMaster, who made an unsuccessful bid for governor that year.
Wilson, 51, has since challenged the Obama and Biden administrations in numerous federal lawsuits, to include multi-state actions in his twice-elected role as chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association. Those challenges have included vaccine mandates, environmental regulations, transgender issues, student loan cancellations, immigration and the Affordable Care Act.
At the state level, he has defended multiple challenges to the state’s six-week abortion ban. He pushed to create the state Human Trafficking Task Force, which he leads. And he has championed legislation criminalizing artificially generated child porn, which became law earlier this year, and sought protections for victims of sex crimes.
In 2013, Wilson launched an investigation into then-House Speaker Bobby Harrell but then handed the case to 1st District Solicitor David Pascoe in 2014, citing an unspecified conflict of interest, who later turned out to be his political consultant. Pascoe, who recently announced a party switch to Republican, expanded the case to other GOP legislators despite Wilson’s attempt to fire him.
Wilson, the son of U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina’s 2nd District, lives in Lexington with his wife and two children. He has served for nearly three decades in the Army National Guard.
Kimbrell, who got his start as host of the conservative Christian talk show “Common Cents” on an Upstate radio station, has made his brand as a social conservative.
In 2020, he ousted state Sen. Glenn Reese, a Democrat who had held the seat for three decades.
In the Senate, he’s been a proponent of the state restrictions on abortion. He also pushed to insert rules into the state budget banning books with sexual content from children’s sections in public libraries and withholding funding from the city of Columbia unless it repealed its law banning licensed therapists from offering so-called conversion therapy to LGBTQ+ minors.
If elected governor, Kimbrell pledges to “champion policies that promote God, family, and faith, ensuring South Carolina remains a beacon of traditional values.”
Other priorities, according to his campaign website, include eliminating the state’s personal income tax, implementing universal school choice, prioritizing mental health care for veterans and using artificial intelligence to sort through and sunset state regulations within 100 days.
The 40-year-old father of two easily won a second, four-year term in November. He can run for governor without risking his spot in the Senate next year, since he doesn’t face re-election to the Statehouse seat until 2028.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-design-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-23 19:03:11.550237

(Getty Images)Pennsylvania’s tax on natural gas development and fracking brought in $164.5 million in 2024 – about $15 million less than the previous year. 
The state Public Utility Commission attributes the decline to a decrease in new wells, which are subject to the highest fees, and natural gas prices that remained roughly even to the previous year. It’s also around $100 million less than in 2022, which saw record revenue.
The tax on new fracking and gas drilling, called an impact fee, was created in 2012 to generate money from energy companies to distribute to communities seeking to address environmental impacts or infrastructure needs created by drilling. Drilling companies pay for each well they own based on the average cost of natural gas and the age of the well, with older wells costing less.
Drilling for natural gas can create environmental issues and pollution, as well as health problems for the surrounding community. Those can be exacerbated if wells are abandoned and land isn’t reclaimed after their use. 
The PUC says the bulk of the money, about $86.5 million, will go to counties and municipalities affected by drilling. Some $57.7 million is earmarked for  the Marcellus Legacy Fund, which supports statewide environmental initiatives and infrastructure projects. Another $20.4 million will be distributed to state agencies like the Department of Environmental Protection, the Emergency Management Agency and others.
“The impact fee continues to provide significant and sustained support for Pennsylvania communities – especially those directly affected by natural gas development,” PUC Chair Stephen M. DeFrank said in a statement.
Jim Welty, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, also weighed in. 
“Natural gas development delivers real, measurable benefits for Pennsylvania communities – driving job creation, powering economic growth and strengthening energy security,” he said in a statement. ““Beyond these core advantages, this industry continues to invest in projects that improve quality of life across the Commonwealth.”
The announcement comes roughly a month after the state Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee approved a bill that would withhold funds raised through impact fees from counties and municipalities that “unreasonably limit” natural gas development, regardless of the impact of nearby wells. As it stands, counties and municipalities with active natural gas development generally receive a larger share of funds.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/natural-gas-well-site-1024x570.jpeg,,,2025-06-23 19:03:11.550237

Free.,US Supreme Court allows third-country deportations for now,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-allows-third-country-deportations-now,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday to allow, for now, the Trump administration to carry out deportations to third countries after a Massachusetts judge barred removals without proper notice.An unsigned order approved by six justices granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to stay a lower court’s decision that barred third-country removals without first giving those removed a chance to raise concerns if they are likely to face harm in the country where they are being deported.“In matters of life and death, it is best to proceed with caution,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent. “In this case, the Government took the opposite approach.”Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined Sotomayor’s dissent.Third-country removals, deportations from the United States to a nation other than an immigrant’s home country, occur when the home country does not accept the immigrant’s repatriation.The Supreme Court order reverses a preliminary injunction U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy of the District of Massachusetts ordered in April that those being removed to a third country must have at least 15 days to challenge their removal if they fear they could face harm.Murphy followed up with an order in early May to delay the removals of several immigrant men from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba and Mexico who were on deportation flights to South Sudan.After Murphy found their removal violated his preliminary injunction, the immigrants were rerouted to a U.S. military base in the East African country of Djibouti, where they had credible fear interviews.The unsigned order means that Murphy’s order is put on hold while the case continues.As the Trump administration aims to carry out mass deportations, the high court’s order will make it easier for the administration to remove immigrants to countries if their home country does not accept their deportation.Sotomayor, in her dissent, said the decision violates due process, the right of people on U.S. soil to defend themselves in court. She argued that the Trump administration openly violated the lower court’s order when several immigrants were removed to South Sudan, which was not their home country.“​​By rewarding lawlessness, the Court once again undermines that foundational principle,” she said. “Apparently, the Court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a District Court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the Government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled.”",,,,2025-06-23 19:03:11.550237

Educators at The Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical Center, better known as The Met School, have voted to unionize with the National Education Association Rhode Island (NEARI).
The Met is a state-funded public school district with a focus on individualized, project-based learning. Across two campuses in Providence and one in Newport, there are 83 educators in total. 
The vote tally for the unionization effort was 46-36, with 82 of 83 eligible voters casting ballots. Stephanie Mandeville, a spokesperson for NEARI, wrote in an email Monday that the vote can become official after five business days, unless the employer files an objection during that timeframe. Otherwise, the aspiring union members can file their first request to bargain a contract after five days, Mandeville said. 
The Met School acknowledged a request for comment Monday, but did not provide comment at the time. 
In the 2023-2024 school year, there were 793 students at The Met School, according to state education department data. Since opening in 1996, The Met School has used what its website labels a “one student at a time” approach, employing learning plans tailored to individual students and crafted in collaboration with youth and their families. 
The Met’s model avoids traditional classroom settings and grading metrics in favor of real-world experiences like internships led by students’ own interests. The school has partnered with over 4,000 local businesses and organizations to supply students with real-world experience, according to its website. 
Advisers form the nucleus of The Met experience, guiding students through their four years of high school. Advisers are typically responsible for groups of about 16 students. Adviser Siobhan O’Malley, who has eight years of experience teaching in Providence, offered a statement on the unionization vote Friday.  
“Met educators are deeply committed to our students, families, and the future of public education. For 30 years, we’ve provided a phenomenal education — one student at a time,” O’Malley wrote. “Now, we’ve organized to ensure that The Met continues to thrive, with smaller class sizes, greater transparency, and a real voice in shaping the future of our school.” 
State data showed that, in the 2023-2024 school year, The Met outperformed state averages in several measures, including postsecondary enrollment. A little over 96% of The Met students graduated in four years, compared to 84.1% of Rhode Island high schoolers statewide. 
The Met School is more demographically diverse than other districts, with significantly higher populations of Hispanic students and economically disadvantaged students compared to statewide averages. A 2.8% dropout rate at The Met is also lower than the state average of 7.9%.
The Met slightly outpaces the state average on proficiency in English Language arts, but trails when it comes to math and science. In the 2023-2024 data, 58.1% of Met students did not meet math proficiency standards, compared to 27.1% of students statewide.
The Providence Met was the first school in the Big Picture Learning network — a collection of over 270 schools globally that pursue the same nontraditional learning model. A Rhode Island state referendum in 1994 for a new kind of high school encouraged the school’s founders to model a new, more personalized approach for learning. By 2003, Rhode Island’s Board of Education started to incorporate some of The Met’s tenets — like advisers and senior exhibitions — into statewide graduation requirements for traditional public schools. 
The Met teachers’ unionization push follows a spate of recent unionizing efforts by educators at non-traditional schools. Teachers at all three grade levels of Paul Cuffee School, a Providence charter, unionized one-by-one in the past year. Highlander Charter School in Providence unionized in August 2024.

The Burlington High School community is mourning the loss of student Eljak Menjwak, who drowned Saturday at Bartlett Falls in Bristol.
The 18-year-old senior jumped from the falls into the New Haven River around 5:10 p.m. He immediately began to struggle in the water, and bystanders were not able to pull him out, according to a press release from Vermont State Police.
Multiple fire and rescue agencies responded to emergency calls, including Bristol Rescue. Menjwak’s body was recovered around 8 p.m., the release said.
State police do not consider the death suspicious or criminal in nature, department spokesperson Adam Silverman said.
“Eljak was a bright light in our school district,” Schools Superintendent Tom Flanagan wrote in a letter to the school community Sunday. “He was deeply loved by his peers, teachers, and mentors, and his presence will be profoundly missed.” 
Counseling services would be available to students and families at Burlington High School on Monday, at Champlain Elementary on Tuesday, and Edmunds Middle School on Thursday, Flanagan’s statement said. Support for staff members will be provided through the employee assistance program. Community members have also started an online GoFundMe fundraiser to support the family.
A viewing is planned for 5 p.m. Friday at the Cathedral of St. Joseph, and the burial will be the following day, school district spokesperson Russell Elek said.

BURLINGTON – Shabir Ayoubi and his wife were approved to resettle in the United States more than a year ago, but navigating bureaucracy stalled the process for months and required expensive visits to U.S. embassies in Pakistan. They eventually arrived in Vermont one snowy evening two months ago.
One of the state’s newest residents, Ayoubi, who now lives in Burlington, was among the people celebrating World Refugee Day Saturday at Leddy Park.
“I came here by chance today,” said Ayoubi, 34. He heard about the event and got a ride from a case worker. He didn’t know it was a party and left his wife behind, he said. They don’t have a vehicle.
They are among the more than 600 Afghans resettled across Vermont after fleeing a country taken over by the Taliban, an extremist group, after what became the longest war in U.S. military history.
The U.S.-led invasion began in 2001 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack and ended in 2021 after U.S. troops withdrew and the Taliban took control of Kabul, the capital city.
Designated by the United Nations, World Refugee Day is celebrated worldwide on June 20 to honor the strength and resilience of people forced to flee their home countries and to shine a light on their rights and needs.
On a sunny summer afternoon, more than 100 refugees enjoyed food, games and camaraderie with their families, resettlement groups, volunteers and allies in a celebration organized by the local chapter of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a nonprofit international organization that addresses and fights for the needs and rights of refugees and immigrants.

Since 1980, USCRI has helped resettle more than 8,500 refugees in Vermont, many of whom were forced to flee their homes because of war, genocide, torture and repressive regimes. These include survivors of the Rwandan massacre, Congolese fleeing war, Afghans persecuted by the Taliban and Ukrainians whose villages were destroyed, according to a Friday press release from USCRI.
Sonali Samarasinghe, field office director of USCRI in Colchester, said the annual picnic aims to celebrate the contributions of new residents in Vermont, many of who showed up Saturday in colorful clothes and traditional attire.
“You enrich us with your culture, your religion, your skills, your food and your commitment to hard work,” she said in a brief speech Saturday. “In this beautiful diversity that we see here today, we are all unified.”
Between games, chatter, plates of heaped food — donated by community partners such as People’s Kitchen, American Flatbread, Grand Buffet, Lake Champlain Chocolate and Hannaford — families enjoyed a picnic in the sun on the shores of Lake Champlain.

Children laughed while rolling off a large ball representing the earth, kicked around soccer balls, spun hula hoops around their bodies, ducked under a large parachute and lined up for fast-melting ice cream on a warm afternoon.
Under a tent, FaReid Munarsyah of The People’s Kitchen served up generous portions of barbecued meats.
“It’s good,” said Aline Kwizera, who came from Burundi and is a multilingual instructor in the Burlington schools. “I love that people can come, talk and share their experiences like this.”

Relocated from Afghanistan in 2024, “best student” Hamida Panjshiri was among former members of the Afghan judiciary who were relocated to the U.S. She lives in Brattleboro, is learning to drive through the Afghan Alliance’s driving program and continues to take weekly English lessons.
“I’m good. I’m happy,” she said. “Because people in Vermont are very kind.”
A French and Spanish interpreter and English tutor with USCRI for more than two decades, Skapski said, “I just love seeing my students, their progress and how much they give to the community.”
While some of the refugees were reluctant to speak about the Trump administration’s roll back of refugee aid, travel and rights, some advocates did not hold back.

“Refugees make Vermont great,” said Tracy Dolan, director of the state refugee office in a brief speech. “We need refugees in Vermont. We need immigrants in Vermont. And we are happy to share our home with you. And no matter what is happening outside of Vermont, no matter what is happening in the country or with the government, we can be together and we can focus on the positive. And we will keep fighting. We will keep fighting for you.”
State Treasurer Mike Pieciak said generations of refugees and immigrants have helped build a stronger nation, from the first Pilgrims fleeing religious persecution in England to his own ancestors to the new refugees who call Vermont home.
“As state treasurer, I spend a lot of time thinking about the future of the Vermont economy,” he said. “As I stand here today with you and enjoy the music, the food and the culture, I can tell you that it’s so clear that refugees do so much more than simply grow our economy. You strengthen our communities all across the state.”
“Refugees so often represent the best of what America means at its core,” he said, thanking the community for leaving behind their hardships and suffering and bringing their strength and resilience to build a life, find community, adjust to a new language and culture – and then having “the strength and the grace” to give back to Vermont with their labor, culture and presence.
Though he is happy to finally be here, to have housing and a job, Ayoubi acknowledged it has been a rough few years for his family, between fleeing Afghanistan and managing the paperwork and delays that stalled their relocation. “It was frustrating,” he said.
Before the Taliban takeover, Ayoubi said he worked in quality control and security for organizations that supported U.S. troops. Barely settled in, Ayoubi is eager to get back to work. 
“I am happy to do anything,” he said.
Ayoubi resettled in Burlington in May as part of a partnership between the Vermont Afghan Alliance, USCRI, Central Vermont Refugee Action Network, and No One Left Behind to continue to welcome Afghans fleeing their homes. He has secured a job with a security services company in Burlington, the Alliance confirmed.
In the face of escalating Trump administration cuts to refugee programs and funding, the theme of this year’s celebration – solidarity with refugees – rings hollow for many refugees across the nation and in Vermont. It’s particularly egregious for the Afghans who served the U.S. but now “face significant challenges and unmet promises,” Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, noted in a Friday press release.
“These Afghan allies risked their lives and the safety of their families to support U.S. missions. In return for their invaluable service, the U.S. Government promised them relocation to the United States and the opportunity to reunite with their families here in Vermont. Unfortunately, almost three years later, many of these promises remain unfulfilled,” the release stated.

The report, put out weekly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, showed Iowa corn rated 83% good to excellent and soybeans rated 77% good to excellent. 
Iowa’s oat crop also rated highly with 85% good or excellent. Nearly all oats in the state, 81%, have headed and 27% are coloring. The first cutting of alfalfa hay was nearly completed during the reporting period from June 16 through June 22. Twenty-four percent of the second cutting is complete.

The state had an average precipitation of 1.82 inches during the reporting period, which was about six-tenths of an inch above the normal. Some areas of the state had higher precipitation for the reporting period, like Mason City which accumulated 4.41 inches — the most for the week.
Soil moisture conditions improved slightly from last week, on average 73% of topsoil moisture was adequate, and just 16% of topsoil was short of moisture. Subsoil moisture for the state as a whole rated 65% adequate and 21% short.

Soil moisture conditions were the worst in southern regions, in particular the southwest region, and also rated poorly in northwest and west central portions of the state.
Temperatures across Iowa were high during the reporting period, with an average of 76 degrees Fahrenheit, which is nearly 5 degrees above normal, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan. 
“Exceedingly warm daytime temperatures in concert with high dewpoints and sustained strong southerly winds produced anomalous conditions not seen at many locations in the observational record,” Glisan wrote in the preliminary weather summary for the state. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the hot, humid and windy conditions from the past week “really made it feel like summer.” 
“Some areas across north-central Iowa received several inches of rain with other locations receiving uninvited hail and high winds,” Naig said. “The warmer temperatures and increased chances for rain are likely to continue through the end of the month.”

Rusty Black, a Republican from Chillicothe, chairs the first meeting of the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force earlier this month (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A group tasked by the governor with reworking Missouri’s formula for funding public schools narrowed in on property tax revenue Monday, discussing how the 20-year-old formula creates inequities with an outdated assumption of local aid.
In the second meeting of the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force, education officials led a conversation on property taxes.
The problem stems from a figure frozen in time, said Kari Monsees, deputy commissioner of the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The formula subtracts assumed local aid based on 2005 property values and applies the same tax rate statewide even though districts vary widely on levies.
“The longer we go on, the further we get from the actual values on our assumptions and the more problematic it is for what we’re trying to do here,” Monsees said.
Since the creation of the current formula in 2005, property values have fluctuated with variation across districts.
“There’s been a lot of changes in property values since 2005,” said David Wood, a former state representative and policy analyst for the Missouri State Tax Commission. “If you try to jump to current numbers… it’s going to be extremely expensive.”
But increasing the cost to the state’s general revenue is not an option.
Gov. Mike Kehoe’s executive order, which convened the work group, calls for funding outcomes “at a level consistent with what is provided for in the State Fiscal Year 2025 budget.” This amount is $300 million under the current budget passed by state lawmakers and awaiting the governor’s signature.
Missouri governor calls for task force to keep state education funding flat

Missouri is seventh in the nation for reliance on property tax revenue for funding public schools, with 47% of funds coming from local taxes, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Missouri has the lowest portion of state aid in its public-school funding, at 30% of school revenues.
The state’s reliance on local funding combined with its outdated figures for property taxes has created a system of winners and losers, with communities with growing property values and higher levies accumulating more funds on a per-pupil basis than their counterparts.
If the assessments 20 years ago were accurate and change was uniform across districts, there  would be “less of a concern,” Monsees said.
“But that’s not the reality,”  he said. “The reality is those reassessment rates and value changes have been significantly different across the state.”
The median home value in districts varies wildly, ranging from $44,500 to $613,300, according to a 2019 review Monsees presented.
The formula assumes a local levy of $3.43 per $100 of assessed value, dubbed the “performance levy.” But districts’ levies vary from $2.75 to almost $6.50 per $100.
He shared examples of districts in the 90th and 10th percentiles, showing some districts have double the operating funds on a per-pupil basis.
Worsening the gaps between districts is a “hold-harmless provision” in the foundation formula, which keeps funding levels stable for districts that would’ve seen a dip in revenue when the formula was established. There are 200 hold-harmless districts, with districts under 350 students keeping total state aid flat and those over 350 getting the same amount per student.
Missouri has had hold-harmless provisions through multiple iterations of the school funding formula, and Monsees said there’s a reason for that. The formula has to be approved by the state legislature, and lawmakers whose districts are losing funds are likely to vote against any changes.
A study of the formula commissioned by education nonprofit Aligned estimates that hold-harmless provisions cost the state $150 million annually. The study recommends that any new formula institute a “temporary hold-harmless provision with a five-year phase out.”
The study is one of three being reviewed by task force members. All three recommended changes in multiple areas to the formula, such as increasing multipliers used to increase funding for special education and measuring student count by enrollment rather than attendance.
The work group is anticipated to meet over the next year and deliver plans to the governor by December 2026.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1621-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 18:05:13.665381

No longer, under a new bill from the Senate president.","Newspapers have long been the repository for legal notices issued by the government. No longer, under a new bill from the Senate president. (Getty Images)New legislation from the state Senate president would allow public entities to stop publishing legal notices in news outlets, a move that would end a practice critics say makes little sense in the 21st-century media environment.
Senate President Nick Scutari’s bill would permit governments to post legal notices on their own websites starting March 1, 2026, and require the secretary of state to help set up a website that would include legal notices from all of New Jersey’s public entities.
The state’s public notice requirements came under renewed scrutiny with the February demise of the Star-Ledger, formerly the state’s largest newspaper (the paper’s owners still produce an online edition). The paper’s end left many public entities without a local newspaper to publish their notices in.
Newspaper publishers have long fought to retain the state’s requirement that legal notices get printed in news outlets, saying published legal notices allow the public to keep tabs on their leaders’ actions.
Brett Ainsworth, president of the New Jersey Press Association, said proposals like Scutari’s take away information from the very places people seek it out — independent news media. 
“Doing so diminishes transparency and erodes trust in government,” Ainsworth said in a statement.
Scutari’s bill has yet to be scheduled for a hearing before the Senate’s budget committee. Bills that are not voted on by June 30 typically don’t face a hearing until the Legislature returns from its summer hiatus. During election years like this one — the governor’s race and all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot in November — lawmakers often don’t return to Trenton until after Election Day. 
Ainsworth said he supports a separate proposal from Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex) that would amend the definition of newspaper in state law to include online news outlets. That bill would require the New Jersey Press Association to maintain a free website with links to public notices. 
Zwicker’s bill would “bolster the civic function of public notices by diversifying news media that can cover notices, thus increasing the online audience that will encounter these notices,” Ainsworth said. 
“Maintaining the public notice function exclusively with independent, third-party news media ensures that proper notice was given by both governmental and private parties. Allowing public notices, even if only partially, to be fulfilled by government on government websites erodes trust of government,” he said.

Ned Lamont made an unplanned endorsement of Andrew Cuomo for mayor of New York on Monday, saying he'd rank Cuomo first on a ballot.","Gov. Ned Lamont made an unplanned endorsement of Andrew Cuomo for mayor of New York on Monday, ignoring the wishes of a top aide who tried to keep him focused on less contentious things — say, the veto of two bills backed by his own party.
At the end of a press conference on his veto of an omnibus housing bill and another that would have provided jobless benefits to strikers, the subject of the former New York governor’s comeback came up.
“If you lived in New York City, would you rank Andrew Cuomo on your ballot tomorrow?” asked Mike Cerulli of WTNH News 8. “He’s your former colleague.”
“I worked with him pretty constructively. I’ll just leave it at that,” Lamont replied.
Lamont worked with Cuomo throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, navigating how to deal with President Donald Trump during his first term when the president both downplayed the health threat — and threatened to quarantine Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.
The pair once fished together in New York, and Cuomo visited Lamont in Hartford.
But endorsing Cuomo, who resigned in August 2021 over a barrage of sexual harassment complaints, would have little upside for Lamont if he runs for another term. And Lamont clearly had no plan to endorse him, even as some prominent Democrats have slowly glided back to Cuomo’s orbit.
Bill Clinton endorsed Cuomo, his former housing secretary, on Sunday, an effort to hold off Zohran Mamdani, a young state lawmaker and Democratic Socialist who has risen in the polls in the Democratic mayoral primary.
But message discipline never has been a strong suit for Lamont.
On Monday, the questioning in Lamont’s office turned from Cuomo and back to the topic of affordable housing. But the governor was pressed again about answering the Cuomo question.

Rob Blanchard, the governor’s communications director, already had announced an end to the press conference, an admonition ignored by the press — and governor.
Blanchard tried again to nudge the press to the door.
“All right, thanks everyone,” Blanchard said.
“Assert yourself, Rob,” Lamont said, laughing.
No one moved.
“You don’t want to say you’re endorsing Andrew Cuomo?” asked Chris Keating of The Hartford Courant.
“That’s not a story,” Blanchard said.
“It’s the biggest election in the country,” Cerulli said. “Many view it as a referendum on the future of the party. You’ve weighed in on that.”
“If you ask me who I’d vote for, I’d vote for Andrew Cuomo,” Lamont replied.
“You’d rank him first?”
“Yeah.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-128-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 18:05:13.665381

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Monday published a new permanent administrative rule to guide how election observers are allowed to conduct themselves at polling places. 
On Friday, the commission voted 5-1 to approve the rule after more than two years of work that involved the participation of a 24-person advisory committee made up of municipal clerks, poll workers, political parties and outside groups including advocates for people with disabilities and right-wing election conspiracy outfits. 
The final rule order specifies who is allowed to observe elections and defines the boundaries of what observers are allowed to do at a polling place. The rule also dictates when poll workers are allowed to call law enforcement to diffuse a situation and includes provisions to require that observers be allowed to use available chairs and restrooms and for how the news media is allowed to operate inside polling places. The rules are different for members of the media, who are allowed to take videos and photos inside polling places while observers are not.
WEC commissioners of both parties advocated for the passage of the rule, arguing that while not perfect, the compromise reached to create the rule was better than the vague interpretation of state law that had previously governed observers. 
But even after their involvement on the advisory committee, election skeptics opposed the rule’s enactment. WEC commissioner Robert Spindell, a Republican who has often flirted with election conspiracy theories, was the lone vote against the rule going into effect. 
Republican lawmakers on the Legislature’s Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) had denied the passage of an emergency rule instituting similar provisions earlier this year. JCRAR deadlocked on a vote to deny the permanent rule’s enactment in April, allowing it to move out of the committee and back to WEC for final approval. 
“Today marks a significant milestone that will ensure election observers, election officials, and voters all have a clear and consistent understanding of the observer process,” WEC Administrator Meagan Wolfe said in a statement. “After years of thorough public hearings, advisory committee input, and careful drafting, this rule enshrines standards for election observers that ensure participation in our electoral process.”
The commission will hold a meeting later this year to approve new guidance for election clerks administering the rule, according to a news release. The rule is set to go into effect Aug. 1.

Let's see what happens at the classified briefing tomorrow.”Jeffries strongly opposed Trump’s intervention in the war between Iran and Israel without first gaining support of Congress.But he sidestepped questions about whether the decision was an impeachable offense or if he would support a bipartisan resolution to restrain the president’s power to wage war in Iran.“The use of military force which is offensive in nature must be approved by the House and the Senate,” he said. “That's according to the Constitution.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham joined leaders from other western states and U.S. territories Monday in publishing a report that proposes government solutions to make housing more affordable across the region.
A group of bipartisan governors joined Lujan Grisham for the opening news conference of the annual Western Governors’ Association in Santa Fe.
As the organization’s chair, Lujan Grisham has for the past year led its push to expand lower-cost options for places to live.
The report offers fixes for what it says are zoning and land use laws that impede housing development, slow and complicated permitting systems, not enough financing tools for affordable housing, high home prices and too few construction workers.

During the news conference, Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, called the report a roadmap for how western state governments can catch up on building workforce and affordable housing, including using public lands.
She pointed to state-owned land at the state fairgrounds in Albuquerque, where New Mexico is “moments away” from announcing the results of a competitive bidding process for hiring a master planner who will oversee multi-use development there.
“We are looking at moving the fair and redeveloping a brand new revitalized housing and community neighborhood initiative there,” Lujan Grisham said. In April, she signed legislation giving state officials authority to issue hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds and take other steps to develop the land.
Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican and the association’s immediate past chair, said issues like housing, water and fire resource management have come to the fore with many people moving to the West.
When the states and the federal government come together, Gordon said, “there really are no problems that we can’t successfully address.”

South Dakota’s Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden said he’s impressed with the reception governors have received from the second Trump administration, however, he believes the country’s problems will not be solved in Washington but rather by state governments.
“I’ve been encouraged that we’ve got cabinet secretaries in place, a number of them that are very willing to work with the governors to find solutions,” Rhoden said.
Several Trump-appointed leaders are scheduled to speak to Western Governors’ Association this week.
When asked about the proposal in Congress for some public lands to at least be nominated to be sold and used for housing, Lujan Grisham said the notion that we don’t need any public lands is likely to be a “non-starter” in New Mexico.
“The process that has been described so far is a problem for a state like New Mexico wherein our public lands, we have a very strong relationship with the openness and they belong to all of us,” Lujan Grisham said. “And selling that to the private sector without a process, without putting New Mexicans first, is, at least for me as a governor, going to be problematic.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he hopes the federal government includes states in a search for federal land that could be used for housing or other uses.
“Coloradans really treasure our access, and it would be a devastating blow to the quality of life, as well as to our economy, if areas were fenced off and the public was denied access,” said Polis, a Democrat.
One of the recommendations in the WGA’s housing report is for Congress to consider legislation to allow agencies beyond the U.S. Forest Service to lease some federal lands for affordable housing used by federal workers and local communities.
“With the concentration of federal lands in the West, leveraging certain parcels for responsible housing development is an additional strategy to address affordable housing shortages,” the report states.

In the months following her mother’s violent death, Pam Martin Harris has found herself questioning God. 
She told lawmakers as much in winter, asking them to make a change. She walked them through the story of her mother’s homicide — and the violent abuse of her corpse that followed. Police found evidence that the 82-year-old’s body had been sexually assaulted and set on fire after her death. 
“In my faith, I have concluded that this was the act of the devil,” Martin Harris said. 
She urged representatives in the House Committee on Judiciary to support a bill that would make it a felony charge to abuse a dead body, a penalty that has never existed in Vermont. Lawmakers in committee started working on the bill, and after the measure made its way through both chambers with near unanimous support, Gov. Phil Scott signed it into law May 22.

Before this year, Vermont law only covered grave robbing and unauthorized burials. It never criminalized the mutilation, incineration or assault of a corpse.
The state should not have waited until 2025 “to cover something of that magnitude,” said Rep. Penny Demar, R-Enosburgh, one of the bill’s lead sponsors. Martin Harris’s testimony made it clear the law was needed, he said. 
Roberta Martin was first reported missing by neighbors who went to check on her at her Enosburgh house one morning in July 2024. Police deemed her disappearance suspicious and were unable to locate her remains until days later. Then, Martin Harris learned her mother’s foot had been found — and her body burnt beyond recognition, she told lawmakers.

“I felt completely broken. The horror that she must have felt was haunting,” Martin Harris said. 
When a loved one goes missing and their family is left in limbo for days or months, holding out hope, “the additional trauma on top of the loss is really unconscionable,” said Jennifer Poehlmann, executive director of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services.
Poehlmann, who supports Martin’s family, declined to comment on their case. Martin’s family declined an interview. 
When a loved one’s body is mutilated, assaulted or incinerated, the family is not able to have the peaceful goodbye they envisioned, Poehlmann said. 
“The closure you never get is unnerving,” Martin Harris told lawmakers. “It’s a void and an ache that’s constant.”
In the days, weeks and months that followed her mother’s death, neighbors were haunted too, said Demar, who represents the town in the Legislature. 
“They were sleeping with the lights on,” he said. 
Demar used to teach a hunter safety course. After Martin’s death, his phone kept ringing, with people in town asking him about gun ownership, he said. 
The new law validates the experiences of survivors by offering a stiffer punishment for the brutality inflicted after the victim’s death, Poehlmann said.
Under the law, set to take effect July 1, dismembering, burning or otherwise abusing a corpse carries up to 5 years in prison, up to a $5,000 fine or both. If the abuse is sexual or for the purpose of concealing a crime, the felony is enhanced to at least 15 years in prison, up to a $10,000 fine or both. 
Burial of a corpse without a proper permit is no longer a crime, but rather a civil penalty up to a $1,000 fine. 
The law also gives prosecutors an added legal tool, Poehlmann said. If a corpse is mutilated, police may lack sufficient evidence to charge the alleged assailant with murder, she said. Or, in a case where one person committed a murder and another person mutilated the body, this law would allow both people to be charged. 
Poehlmann said she is alarmed that there are a number of cases, either recently resolved or still in court, in which someone accused of murder also mutilated the victim’s corpse. Because those cases predate the new law, those people will not face additional charges for any abuses after the victim’s death. 
If anything, Demar worries the law might not go far enough. 
“It’s a savage crime,” he said. “I think these people should be put away for a long, long time.”

What do changes to federal law mean for the bird?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Jan Ellen Spiegel to discuss her article, “What could Trump’s changes mean for CT endangered species?” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short.
WSHU: Hello, Jan. Let’s start with the Endangered Species Act, which was passed during the Nixon administration in 1973. Could you explain what the law does and how President Trump wants to change it? You’ve used the situation of the piping plover in Connecticut, for example.
JES: Broadly, it set up a structure for protecting species that were at risk for some sort of difficulty, whether it’s a threat to their habitat, or just an overall threat or endangerment that might be visited upon them by development or drilling or, you know, fill in the blank. Over time, they’ve proven to be one of the biggest factors in terms of threats to wildlife. And I should say parenthetically, we’re talking mammals, birds, insects, amphibians, fish, marine mammals, marine fish, and we are talking plants. So we’re talking about a lot of things here.
WSHU: So, pretty much what the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service does, and the National Marine Fisheries Service does, right?
JES: Yes, the National Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries do. They kind of jointly run this, although the National Wildlife Service has most of it. What the Trump administration is endeavoring to do is something that they actually signaled in Project 2025, they were going to do. And as we’ve seen now, you know, they followed Project 2025 pretty closely. They want to eliminate habitat as part of the definition of what it means to harm a species of any sort. And what has raised all kinds of ire over is, as I indicated, this is what most folks see as the key factor in causing species harm, threatening endangerment, you name it. An example here in Connecticut might be something like the piping plover, which we’ve all heard about, the small shorebirds that need a certain amount of shoreline that is above the tide line that provides them with the kind of food they need, and people to stay away from them.
WSHU: And what we’ve been doing is fencing off those areas, right?
JES: Yes, a lot of those areas where they breed have been fenced off. On the coastline, it’s been fenced off. But here’s the thing: the habitat is still at risk. And the habitat in this particular case is at risk, really, from climate change, which has brought in sea level rise, stronger storms, and it shrunk and shrunk and shrunk that habitat. So, where will these guys go? There isn’t enough room. One of the things I could see when I was in an area where they had some of these nests fenced off was that you could see where the high tide line had come through the fencing. Well, sooner or later, as sea levels continue to rise, assuming the world, the U.S., doesn’t take any, you know, really definitive action here. It’s just going to overrun the habitat. Well, where will these birds go? And that’s just, I mean, that’s just a single issue of why habitat is important. I mean, going back years and years and years, if you think out west, with the spotted owl fight over logging, and that was going to take away their habitat for nesting and everything else. Almost any species you can think of, habitat really plays a critical role. There are a few exceptions, but habitat is the big one.
WSHU: The Trump administration is drilling down on the word take. It says to take means to capture, kill, or trap. It doesn’t mean protecting the habitat. How are they arguing this?
JES: Well, in that list, you listed a few of the words in that list, but the key word is harm, and harm has been not just interpreted, but it’s been litigated in the Supreme Court in the past not just to mean kill, but to harm them in other ways, one of which is loss of habitat or degradation of habitat, and that’s what they’re going after. It’s the word harm in particular in that set of items related to the word take.
WSHU: Okay, so if there are environmental changes because of the Trump administration policies. Is there anything the state can do? What do we have as state protections for endangered species in Connecticut?
JES: Connecticut, along with other states, but by no means lots of states, has its own Endangered Species Act in place. Whatever the Trump administration does, it’ll have a tangential impact on what Connecticut decides to do, but it’ll have some impact, and the state will not have to change its own laws. Our Endangered Species Act lists gobs and gobs of species that it considers endangered, and a rung down threatened, or another rung down species of concern, and there are state regulations in place. Some shoreline towns, in particular, have some local zoning rules and other kinds of rules in place. But where you run into trouble is when you have species that sort of run in interstate ways. An example I was given is something called a Bog Turtle, which New York also has. Well, it’s on the federal list. It’s also on the state list. But if New York does something that would impact what happens in Connecticut, we as Connecticut would not really have the ability to say, ‘Hey, New York, stop doing that.’ But the Feds would.
WSHU: The environment doesn’t respect state boundaries, the ecosystem and the larger ecosystem?
JES: Yeah, no. I mean, we’re all in ecosystems, and they interact in many different ways, and the habitat is one. Suppose the habitat is degraded to a point that whatever species is there can’t live there. Well, if you’re a freshwater fish or in a muscle that is in Connecticut, well, how do you move? It’s fresh water. Now, if you’re a marine mammal, you can move to cooler waters. If you’re a bird, you can move. But you know, the vegetation that you eat, or the species in the water that you may eat, or the insects that it may eat, will they move in time? These things have to sync up. I should also say we have an example here in Connecticut and throughout a lot of the northeast, you know, one type of animal that is definitely endangered that doesn’t have to do with habitat. Those are bats, any number of types of bats. The State of Connecticut, on its list, has a whole mess of them. The feds for our area have two. They suffer from a disease, something called White Nose Syndrome. They got plenty of habitat, but we have this disease that we haven’t figured out a way to get rid of yet.
WSHU: The state of Connecticut wants some more species added to the federal list. What’s happening with that?
JES: The big one here is something called a salt marsh Sparrow. Again, this is habitat-related, not unlike the piping plover, which nests way down in the salt marsh. The piping plover nests are slightly higher, but the Marsh sparrows nest way down in the salt marsh. And if we’re having even a full moon, high tide or increased sea levels or a bad storm, those nests can wash out very easily and the Center for Biological Diversity actually petitioned the federal government some time ago to add that to the federal list. They were told by a different administration that fish and wildlife was going to add it. It never happened. The Center for Biological Diversity said to me that they really don’t think the Trump administration will do anything about it unless the center takes the administration to court.
WSHU: Bottom line is that Connecticut officials are trying to get local communities more involved. Could you just tell us a little bit about that? And is that an anecdote to what could possibly change on the federal level?
JES: It can certainly help. What the Audubon Connecticut has done, using its its own foundation money the past couple of summers, is coordinate with Stratford and West Haven to help train local officials on how to understand what’s going on with the shorebirds and be cognizant of that if you know they notice something untoward at the beach, it builds on a lot of regulations that shoreline towns already have, really to protect people and the beaches themselves. Don’t bring dogs on the beach, don’t make fires on the beach, no ATVs on the beach, but Audubon Connecticut points out that these regulations, while they’re good for people, also happen to be good for some of the wildlife. But police officers, for instance, who monitor this stuff may be, you know, completely uninformed of the regulations that are on the books and the issue of endangered species on the beaches. So if they see a fire on the beach, they would now know, not only do I deal with the people who set the fire, but let me go check for the birds, because it’s nesting season.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Piping-Plover-fledgling-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 18:05:13.665381

Commission members said in their emails to colleagues that the body was ”undercut” and ""never fully embraced"" by the Legislature and its role in new legislation did little to convince them otherwise.

Two members of the Commission on the Future of Public Education in Vermont, including the commission’s chair, announced last week they would be resigning, saying they no longer believed their efforts would make any impact.
Meagan Roy, the chair of the commission, and Nicole Mace, the representative of the Vermont School Boards Association, both announced they would be leaving the commission in June 19 emails to fellow commissioners viewed by VTDigger.
Both members said the commission’s refined role, as laid out in the landmark education reform bill approved by the Legislature last week, H.454, does not give the commission the power to inform or influence the state’s efforts to reform public education policy.
“Even with the revised charge of the Commission, I cannot in good faith dedicate my professional time and energy to a body that I can’t be certain will be legitimately part of the work moving forward,” Roy wrote.

Likewise, Mace, who serves as the vice chair of the Winooski School District Board of Trustees, wrote in her email that the commission was “never fully embraced” by policymakers since its creation during the 2024 legislative session.
“I supported the basic framework for education reform that was built in the House-passed version of H.454,” she wrote. “But what has transpired since then has revealed this process of reform will go down the same path as many failed reform efforts of the past — carve-outs for powerful interests, last-minute deals based on political expediency and not what what’s best for the system, and a disregard for the educators who show up every day and do extraordinary work on behalf of the children of our state.”
Mace added that she “cannot continue to participate in a process that sacrifices equity and accountability in favor of power, privilege, and political games.”
Roy said in a phone interview that independent schools were the only group lawmakers prioritized and protected when they crafted the bill. 
“What we’ve witnessed is a process that’s become very political and driven in that way, not driven by good education policy,” she said. 
The resignations come as Gov. Phil Scott waits for legislative lawyers to finalize the language in the education reform bill, which he is expected to sign. The bill calls for a radical transformation of Vermont’s public education system over several years by consolidating the state’s 119 school districts and creating a new education funding formula.
The Commission on the Future of Public Education in Vermont was first created as part of 2024’s Act 183, the law that set the double-digit average property tax increases needed that year to keep pace with ballooning public education costs.
The law established the 13-member body, composed of lawmakers and education officials, and tasked it with studying Vermont’s public education system and making recommendations to reduce costs while ensuring equal educational opportunities for all students. The commission must create a final report due in December.
But the commission, Roy wrote in her resignation letter, was “undercut” in January when Scott released his own sweeping proposal calling for the consolidation of Vermont’s 119 school districts down to as few as five regional administrative districts.
From then on, the commission lacked buy-in from all sides of the political spectrum, and members were uncertain of the point of the commission, according to commission members.

In H.454, lawmakers gave the commission room to “work closely” with the state’s School District Redistricting Task Force, which is expected to begin meeting in August to craft new school district configurations, according to the bill. 
The task force is expected to utilize the commission’s public engagement efforts “to maximize public input regarding the development of the proposed new school district boundaries,” the bill states.
The bill also tasked the commission with making recommendations to the Legislature about what roles and powers should remain at the local school district level versus what should move to the state level. The commission, the bill reads, should also recommend “a process for a community served by a school to have a voice in decisions regarding school closures and recommendations for what that process should entail.”
In an interview, Roy said these remain critical questions to answer, but “we don’t have evidence to suggest that the General Assembly actually wants our opinion.”
“There’s not a track record to demonstrate the commission will be listened to,” she said.
It was not immediately clear who would replace Roy and Mace, or serve as the chair. Their positions on the commission are listed as vacant on an agenda for a future meeting.

For the first time since 2019, House and Senate Democrats have reached an agreement on joint rules to guide their work in the legislative session that began six months ago.
The post House, Senate say they have agreement on joint rules appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","FOR THE FIRST time since 2019, House and Senate Democrats have reached an agreement on joint rules to guide their work in the legislative session that began six months ago.
House Speaker Ronald Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka said late Monday morning that negotiators had come to terms on a new set of rules and that the final compromise language would be made available later Monday.
“At the beginning of this session, we committed our respective chambers to deliver a transparent and efficient legislative process that meets the moment,” Mariano and Spilka said in a statement. “This agreement draws on key provisions from each chamber’s original proposals, and represents our shared commitment to creating an accessible and productive Legislature that responds to the concerns of our constituents and delivers for Massachusetts.”
Democrat negotiators have failed to agree on a final package of joint rules in each of the prior two sessions, leaving the House and Senate operating under 2019-era policies extended on what was supposed to be a temporary basis.
This year, Democrats in both branches moved to enact significant changes to the way they work together, saying they want to increase legislative transparency and efficiency after a particularly chaotic summer last year. Lawmakers failed to finish significant work by the usual July 31 deadline, but eventually got many priorities across the finish line during a time of year that had been off-limits for major lawmaking for decades.
Almost two hours after Mariano and Spilka announced the agreement, lead negotiators Senate Majority Leader Cindy Creem and House Majority Leader Michael Moran provided greater details of their accord.
“This bipartisan effort reflects a shared commitment to enhancing transparency, improving legislative efficiency, and ensuring accessible and accountable lawmaking for the people of the Commonwealth,” a fact sheet provided by Creem’s office said. “Among the reforms are longer public notice periods for hearings, mandatory committee hearing livestreaming and archiving, an earlier reporting deadline for joint committees, the recording and posting of committee votes, new requirements for bill summaries, and rules ensuring more timely public access to conference committee reports.”
Public hearings of joint legislative committees must be announced 10 days in advance, up from the current three days, and those committees will be required to produce a complete schedule of hearings within three weeks of committee appointments. All committee votes are to be publicly posted online.
Once bills are in committee and get a hearing, Senate and House committee members will vote only on bills filed in their respective branch. That has been the practice so far this session, and the change has given senators (who are outnumbered on joint committees) a greater ability to advance legislation without necessarily getting buy-in from representatives.
Bills filed by someone other than a member of the Legislature (the governor, for example), so-called money bills that get filed in the Senate, and amendments to the Constitution filed in the House will continue to be voted on by both House and Senate committee members.
Joint committees will be required under the proposed rules accord to act on legislation no later than the first Wednesday of December of the first year of the two-year session, moving the bill-reporting deadline about two months earlier than its current place on the calendar on the first Wednesday in February of the second year of the session. Under House rules, committees must act on bills filed in the House no later than 60 days after the bill’s hearing, with an additional 30-day extension available at the discretion of the chair.
The proposed joint rules agreement would also allow the Legislature to meet in formal sessions after its traditional end date of July 31 in the second year of the session, but only to take up reports from conference committees formed on or before July 31, appropriations bills filed after July 31, and gubernatorial vetoes or amendments.

Shri Thanedar – calling for the Trump administration to halt the use of the Guantanamo Bay prison facility for migrant detention.
In a letter sent Monday to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Tlaib (D-Detroit) and her colleagues also called for the permanent closure of the facility.
“We write to express our outrage at the ongoing and recently proposed expansion of detention of immigrants at Guantánamo Bay,” the letter said. “For over two decades, Guantánamo Bay has been synonymous with injustice, torture, and Islamophobia. President Trump’s decision to hold thousands of immigrants – many of whom are asylum seekers and refugees – in a facility notorious for human rights abuses is morally abhorrent and unlawful.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Aside from Thanedar (D-Detroit), the letter was also signed by notable Democrats in Tlaib’s orbit, like U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.
“These detention facilities at Guantánamo should have been closed years ago,” the lawmakers wrote. “It is unacceptable that not only are they still operational, but they are being repurposed for yet another generation of unjust detention. As long as the United States maintains a detention facility at Guantánamo, future administrations will continue to use it to try and deprive non-citizens of meaningful access to the courts and the full protections of U.S. and international law.”

A wide swath of anti-torture, immigration and other social advocacy groups endorsed the letter, including Amnesty International USA, Human Rights Watch, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the National Immigrant Justice Center.
“We call on the administration to immediately halt the use of Guantánamo for migrant detention, close the detention facilities for good, and ensure that all detained individuals are treated with dignity, due process, and the protections guaranteed under both U.S. and international law.”
The other Democratic members of Michigan’s Congressional delegation – U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) – did not sign the letter, nor did any member of Michigan’s Republican delegation.
The letter is unlikely to have any tangible effect either within the Trump administration or the Republican controlled U.S. House and U.S. Senate.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/guantanamo-1024x511.jpeg,,,2025-06-23 18:05:13.665381

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Washington’s congressional delegation was divided along party lines in reacting to President Donald Trump’s decision to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran over the weekend. 
Democrats largely criticized the president’s decision. They said he should’ve consulted Congress and suggested he’d put the U.S. at risk of getting drawn into another protracted conflict in the Middle East. 
Washington’s two Republicans in the House applauded the move, pointing to Iran’s ambitions to build nuclear weapons.
On Monday, Iran responded to the U.S. attack by firing missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Below is a roundup of lawmakers’ statements.
The Senators
(Murray and Cantwell are both Democrats)
U.S. Sen. Patty Murray:
We can all agree that Iran should never possess a nuclear weapon. But the American people do not want to begin a war with Iran, and Trump does not have the unilateral authority to start one. 
This strike was unconstitutional. I share the questions the American people have. What is the strategy here? Why are we putting American lives at risk? The administration must now do its utmost to ensure service members and civilians in the region are protected against retaliation. 
The United States of America is a democracy with constitutional separation of powers, and that requires a president — any president — to come to Congress to approve the use of military force.
Full statement
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell:
The United States should work to do everything it can to avoid a larger war with Iran or a larger Middle East conflict. It requires working with our allies and the international community to move towards diplomatic solutions that ensure that Iran is no longer a state sponsor of terrorism and national security threat. 
Congress should work to pass the Enhanced Iranian Sanctions Act. Congress must also reassert its constitutional authorities to head off future reckless or shortsighted Presidential actions on issues of war and trade. The United States must rebuild the international coalition of allies and partners forged under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and build on it by penalizing countries that break international sanctions and buy Iranian oil at discounted prices. 
Full statement
House Republicans
U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner:
There is no greater threat to the world than nuclear proliferation, let alone from a regime that has consistently used radical Islamic terrorists to attack and kill Americans for nearly 4 decades. I fully support President Trump’s decision to bomb Iran’s nuke reactor. Trump gave Iran a choice. The Ayatollah chose poorly. 
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse:
The decisive actions taken by the United States come as Iran refused to end development of their nuclear program, and I stand with our ally Israel as we work together to end this dangerous regime’s efforts towards a nuclear weapon of mass destruction. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. 
Full statement
House Democrats
U.S. Rep. Adam Smith:
(Smith is the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee)
I condemn in the strongest terms the President’s decision to order the U.S. military to strike Iran’s nuclear sites. The President did not seek authorization from Congress or demonstrate that Iran posed an immediate threat to the security of the United States. Furthermore, the President failed to provide clear objectives for these actions and there are no guarantees that it will eliminate the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon or how long it might set their program back.
Engaging in direct conflict places U.S. service members and military sites in the Middle East squarely in the crosshairs of Iran and its many proxies. Tonight’s actions could further escalate tensions, destabilize the region, and drag the United States into an avoidable war.
The way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and to protect American service members is through diplomacy and negotiation, not entering into direct conflict. The path that the President has chosen risks unleashing a wider war in the region that is both incredibly unpredictable and treacherous and that threatens the safety and security of the United States, Israel, and ultimately the world.
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene:
Trump’s strike against Iran was unconstitutional. Under the Constitution, Congress has the explicit power to declare war and authorize military force. 
These actions risk drawing the U.S. and our service members into another war in the Middle East, without explanation.
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen:
The history of military conflict in the Middle East is that conflicts are difficult to contain and never seem to end. The Administration’s decision to unilaterally intervene in the Israel-Iran war by bombing Iran’s nuclear program sites will drag the United States deeper into the Middle East without a clear end game.
The United States must now focus on protecting U.S. forces in the region, coordinating with allies to share intelligence regarding Iranian or proxy retaliation, and seeking a return to diplomacy.
Diplomacy has always been the best way to impose long-term limits on the Iranian nuclear program, like the multilateral agreement President Obama achieved before Trump unwisely pulled out of it. It remains unclear how much damage the strike did to the Iranian nuclear program infrastructure.
Congress must reassert its authority and oversight over Trump’s military decisions and not be cowed into approving a bloated Pentagon budget using this attack as a pretext.
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal: 
The authority to declare war belongs solely to Congress. Trump’s unconstitutional and escalatory strikes risk drawing US troops and the American people — who are overwhelmingly opposed — into another forever war. Congress must immediately exercise our duty to restrain this President. 
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier:
President Trump’s unilateral decision, made without proper consultation with Congress, will have widespread consequences that we cannot predict.
We know Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism around the world and must never possess a nuclear weapon. There is no guarantee that yesterday’s actions will permanently achieve that goal, and none of us want the U.S. pulled into another endless war in the Middle East that puts our country and brave servicemembers at extreme risk.
We must do everything possible to de-escalate and foster lasting diplomacy, peace, and stability in the Middle East. 
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Emily Randall: 
President Trump’s decision to circumvent Congress to attack Iran is as unconstitutional as it is terrifying. This decision has put our service members, the American people, and innocent civilians in the region at significant risk — with no clear objective and no plan for what comes next.
We can have political differences — that’s a core principle of our democracy. But what we cannot tolerate is the abuse of power — and our constitution mandates that no president can take military action without the approval of Congress.
While we can agree that Iran should not have nuclear power, we do not need another endless war or more families getting knocks on the door that their loved one is gone.
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Marilyn Strickland:
The Islamic Republic Guard (IRG) of Iran must be stopped in its quest for nuclear weapons. They are the most prolific state sponsor of terrorism — supporting and funding Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. For the 40+ years the IRG has ruled Iran, they have abused and terrorized their own people, and stated that they seek to destroy Israel and the United States.
Peace and stability in the region must now be the priority through multinational diplomacy and thoughtful negotiations. President Trump’s action on Iran has dangerously escalated tensions and put American lives at risk.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Morningside University has selected its board of directors chair to serve as its temporary leader as current president Albert Mosley prepares to depart for a new job.
The private university, located in Sioux City, announced in a news release Friday that Mosley will leave the university on June 30 to take on the role of president at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida. Chad Benson, chair of the board of directors and a Morningside alum, will work as the interim president for the next two years.

“Serving as President of Morningside has been a tremendous honor,” Mosley said in the release. “This is a place full of blessings, promise, and heart. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished together and deeply grateful for the support of the board, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and this incredible community. I know Morningside is in great hands and will continue to flourish into the future.”
Mosley started as Morningside’s president in 2022, the release stated, and during his time at the university he led efforts to modernize technology across campus and expand academic programming, such as initiating a fundraising campaign that would add a business school to the college’s offerings.
According to the release, the board will use the two-year period of Benson’s interim presidency to explore “long-range strategic opportunities and timing for the university’s next presidential search.” Former board chair and current trustee Curt White will step into the role once again during this period.
White said in the release Benson is the right choice to lead the university during this transitional period, with his longtime relationship to Morningside and his leadership and strategic skills.
“Dr. Mosley has served Morningside with energy, grace, and an unwavering belief in our mission,” Benson said in the release. “We thank him for his impact and wish him the very best as he begins a new chapter. Morningside is in motion—and we remain laser-focused on delivering an experience that equips students to thrive in a complex world through innovation, character, community, and purpose.”

(Getty Images)The Idaho Behavioral Health Council is asking for the public’s help in identifying priorities for spending the state’s share of funding from a settlement agreement with opioid manufactures.
The fund from the settlement agreement provides about $2 million per year for opioid abatement programs and activities in Idaho, according to a press release issued Monday by the Idaho Behavioral Health Council.
Under the agreement, 40% of the settlement money goes to the state, 40% goes to participating cities and counties and 20% goes to public health districts.
Millions of dollars to combat opioid abuse are coming to Idaho

The council’s job is to recommend spending priorities to Gov. Brad Little and the Idaho Legislature, and the council is asking for public feedback and ideas before developing the spending priorities. 
The Idaho Behavioral Health Council published a list of potential opioid abatement strategies online that the public can provide feedback on.
Potential strategies include expanding availability of treatments for opioid use disorder, expanding telehealth to increase access to treatment for opioid and substance abuse disorder, providing additional supports like housing, child care, transportation, education and job placement to people in treatment, ensuring health care providers screen for opioid use disorder and more.
Anyone in Idaho may make recommendations, suggest priorities or offer feedback by sending an email to IdahoBehavioralHealthCouncil@idcourts.net by July 31. 
The Idaho Behavioral Health Council is scheduled to determine its spending priorities during its upcoming Aug. 22 meeting.
More information about the opioid settlement agreement is available on the Idaho Behavioral Health Council’s website.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)The 19-year-old counter-protester arrested at the Nashville “No Kings” Rally for brandishing a firearm now faces a federal charge for unlawful possession of a firearm.
Federal authorities say Elijah Millar of Murfreesboro violated a court-ordered conservatorship that restricted his access to firearms.
The Rutherford County Chancery Court appointed an emergency conservator for Millar in 2023, finding him “at risk of substantial harm to his health, safety and welfare,” according to court documents. Another Chancery Court judge found Millar to be a “disabled person needing care” in September 2024 and issued an “Agreed Order of Limited Conservatorship” that restricted his access to firearms, according to the federal criminal complaint.
If convicted on the federal charge, he faces up to 15 years in federal prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
Nashville police arrested Millar at Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park on June 14 after rally attendees notified police that he “was involved in heated arguments and spitting at people when he pulled out a gun that he pointed toward the ground, placing witnesses and others in the crowd in fear,” according to Metro Nashville police. 

Nashville police seized a 9 mm pistol from Millar, court documents state.
Millar was wearing a black hat and mask, sunglasses, fingerless gloves and a bright yellow tie, and carried a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag. He was charged with disorderly conduct and his bond was set at $1,500.
Davidson County General Sessions Court does not list an attorney of record for Millar.
Three days later, Murfreesboro Police Department Criminal Investigations Division detectives arrested Millar on three counts of carrying or possession of a weapon related to incidents on June 16 and in April 2025, according to a department news release. 
Police responded to a West Murfreesboro home after online reports alleged that Millar made suicidal statements, according to Murfreesboro police. Responding officers found a loaded 9mm handgun in Millar’s waistband and Millar was taken to the hospital for evaluation. 
Millar was charged on June 17 after being discharged from the hospital for violating the terms of his  conservatorship, according to Murfreesboro police.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation Joint Terrorism Task Force assisted Murfreesboro police in serving the warrant on the home. 
Millar is being held without bond at Rutherford County Adult Detention Center ahead of a July 21 hearing in General Sessions Court.
Millar is also scheduled to appear in Davidson County General Sessions Court on July 25.
“The right to peaceably protest government action is guaranteed by the First Amendment and cannot be infringed upon by armed individuals whose actions put people in danger,” Robert E. McGuire, acting U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, stated in a news release. “Our efforts to hold firearm offenders accountable are designed to keep all members of the public safe from potential violence.”

(Photo by No New Letcher Prison)The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking to claw back $500 million for a prison in Letcher County, a project that has been subject to stops and starts for nearly two decades. 
A Justice Department budget request dated June 13 proposes to rescind construction funding for a medium-security prison in Roxana for the upcoming fiscal year that starts in October. 
It’s not the first time a federal administration has tried to ax funding for the proposed prison that Republican U.S. Rep Hal Rogers has worked to bring to Letcher County since 2006. 
The first Trump administration killed a plan for a high-security prison on the site, calling the hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for the project “wasteful spending” at a time when prisoner numbers were declining. A Biden administration budget also proposed canceling funding for the prison.
But in 2022, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) under the Biden administration switched the plan to a medium-security prison. The bureau moved forward with acquiring land for the project last year after a process to determine its environmental impacts.  It’s funding for the medium-security prison that the Trump Justice Department now is seeking to rescind. 
Rogers, a long-time advocate for the prison project, in a statement provided to the Lantern, said the Letcher project would address the prison bureau’s need for modernized facilities and that he secured the $500 million in federal funding as a key appropriator in Congress.
Rogers, in his 23rd term, sits on the powerful U.S. House Appropriations Committee and leads a subcommittee overseeing funding for the U.S. Department of Justice that includes funding for federal prisons. 
“The people of Letcher County have invested nearly 20 years of planning and preparation for a new federal prison to bring more than 300 much-needed jobs to our region,” Rogers said in his statement. “The proposed prison has surpassed multiple environmental studies and every ounce of red tape that has been doled out. Years of investments have been made in good faith to support this project at the federal, state and local levels, and I will continue working to see it to completion.” 
An email requesting comment from the Justice Department about the funding recission was not immediately returned Monday afternoon. The Lexington Herald-Leader had previously reported on the proposed funding rescission. 
The proposed prison project has also faced pushback from a coalition of local and national activists seeking to stop the project. The progressive think tank Kentucky Center for Economic Policy has also questioned economic development arguments made in favor of the prison, highlighting other Eastern Kentucky counties with prisons that have seen economic and population declines. 
In January, an Indigenous group backed by the coalition of activists announced it had purchased land within the boundaries of the proposed prison project and sought to use the land for other purposes. Rogers had said the move came as no surprise “from a group led by Kentucky outsiders and liberal extremists.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/22a92b_a77a331b6b7b4a90ab4d3addb30b15a6mv2.jpeg-2048x1095-1-1024x548.webp,,,2025-06-23 17:04:39.271404

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)With the Maine House of Representatives and Senate wrapping up their work, the final stream of legislation from the first half of the 132nd Legislature has been making its way to the governor’s desk. 
Each week, the clerk of the House of Representatives publishes a report of the bills that Gov. Janet Mills has signed into law and those that she has allowed to become law without the endorsement of her signature. 
Between June 15-18, Mills signed nearly 50 bills into law. The new statutes modify the law about high-impact transmission lines born out of a 2021 referendum question and limit the liability of gun shops that enter into firearm hold agreements.

Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, responds to the governor's State of the State Address during a press conference afterwards on Jan. 14, 2025. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Democratic state Sen. Fred Love said Monday that he is running for Arkansas governor.
In a statement, Love said his campaign will focus on “protecting public schools, empowering communities, and driving inclusive economic growth across the state — especially in rural and underserved areas.”
“We can either stay on the path that sidelines our kids, weakens our schools, and silences our towns — or we can choose a future that values every student, every community, and every small business owner,” the southwest Little Rock lawmaker said.
Love is the second Democrat to announce intent to run against Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in 2026. Businessman Gary Huskey of Blytheville announced his plan to run last month.
Sanders is so far the only announced Republican candidate for governor, and the state party last week made challenging her harder than before by raising the candidate filing fee from $15,000 to $40,000, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The party’s executive committee also raised the fee to run for U.S. Senate from $20,000 to $40,000.
Love’s announcement of his gubernatorial plans follows his wife’s announcement in early June month that she will run for his District 15 Senate seat next year.  Love is term-limited and cannot run for reelection. He served in the House of Representatives from 2011 through 2022 and was elected to the Senate in 2022.
ShaRhonda Love is one of three women who have said they will run for the open Senate seat. State Rep. Tara Shephard, who represents southwest Little Rock’s District 79 in the House, announced last month, and Charity Smith-Allen, wife of state Rep. Fred Allen of Little Rock, announced her candidacy last week.
In Monday’s announcement, the senator unveiled an economic development plan for sustainable growth throughout the state. The plan includes:

Establishing regional economic development hubs tailored to local industries and workforce needs.
Expanding access to startup capital, infrastructure, and grants for small businesses.
Partnering with HBCUs, community colleges, and high schools to align education with job creation.
Investing in broadband, water, and utility infrastructure to make every community business-ready.

“We must stop measuring progress only by what happens in a few cities,” Love said. “Prosperity should be visible in our Delta towns, our Ozark communities, and our Main Streets—not just in spreadsheets.”
Primary elections next year will take place March 3, and the general election will be Nov. 3, 2026.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Love.Collins2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 17:04:39.271404

(Courtesy of Virginia Railway Express)Virginia Railway Express CEO Rich Dalton will retire from the commuter rail service in the fall, the operations board announced on Friday.
Dalton’s retirement will go into effect on Oct. 3. Board members will be responsible for creating a search and selection committee for his replacement.
“It’s time. It may not ever be a good time, but it’s time,” said Dalton briefly on Friday.
  Virginia Railway Express CEO Rich Dalton (Courtesy of Virginia Railway Express)
Dalton led the system through its planning process for the 2050 System Plan and Vision. The plan aims to assist officials in responding to evolving travel patterns, particularly those of commuting office workers, which have changed significantly over the past decade.
According to VRE, the recently adopted plan aims to transform rail in Virginia by shifting VRE from a “commuter-focused rail service to a more regional operation with the eventual addition of bi-directional and weekend service, responding to shifting passenger needs and bolstering economic growth throughout Northern Virginia and surrounding jurisdictions.” 
VRE connects Central and Northern Virginia with the District of Columbia. The system’s two lines, Manassas and Fredericksburg, serve 19 stations, including two – L’Enfant and Union Station – in D.C.
Dalton’s long-standing involvement with VRE goes back to 1992, when he worked with local automotive manufacturer Morrison-Knudsen, now known as Wabtec, since the commuter rail service launched its first trains.
Dalton joined the system as chief operating officer in 2009 before stepping in as interim in 2019 and then permanent CEO in 2020. During his tenure, he managed multiple projects to develop the system and its resilience amid changes including ridership.
Under his tenure, the system also navigated through periods of instability, including the pandemic, which continues to impact ridership and budgets across the region. VRE said the system “maintained high rider satisfaction with no substantial impacts to operations during the pandemic.”
The projects he helped lead included implementing technology to automatically prevent train accidents caused by human error, extending VRE service to Spotsylvania County in 2015 and maintenance plans to minimize costs.
“If nothing else, Rich’s legacy would be a legacy of safety,” said board chair Sarah Bagley on Friday. “I think that’s a legacy we’re very proud of, is the role that you have placed in making sure everybody is as safe as they can be with your organization.”

Mennen Williams Building in Lansing, Mich., on May 15, 2025. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has signed onto a legal brief alongside 22 other attorneys general to support lawsuits brought by the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio that are attempting to block federal funding cuts to their organizations.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in May to cut federal funding for NPR and PBS, stating in the order that “neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens”.
Since then, NPR and PBS filed two separate lawsuits arguing the funding cuts threaten the First Amendment and create public safety hazards for citizens served by their local affiliates who rely on public media for weather, health and safety alerts.
Forum highlights cost defunding public media has on emergency alerts, educational programming

The brief Nessel and other attorneys general filed last week backs the arguments made by public media and warns of the harm that could come from weakening public media programming and infrastructure.
“Public media is a vital source of independent information for countless Michiganders and Americans, especially in rural communities, where it is often the only option available,” Nessel said in a news release Monday.
Law enforcement depends on public media when issuing AMBER Alerts to find abducted children, as well as Silver Alerts for missing elderly individuals or individuals with developmental disabilities, the legal brief outlines. Public broadcasters provide critical coverage of emerging public safety threats like active shooters, especially in news deserts where public media may be the only resource to quickly disseminate information, the brief adds.
The public media stations in Michigan, many serving rural communities outside of many news outlets’ coverage areas, also provide emergency information that help residents navigate extreme weather of other crises, Nessel’s news release said. 
“Attempts to defund public journalism are a blatant attack on the press and the First Amendment, and a disservice to the people who rely on it every day,” Nessel said. “Public radio reaches nearly every corner of our state, and I am proud to stand with my colleagues and with public media in defense of this essential news source.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma City is gearing up to host a historic parade Tuesday to celebrate the city’s first NBA championship. 
The roughly two-mile long parade, which is expected to draw thousands of fans, will begin at 10:30 a.m. at Northwest 10th Street and North Harvey Avenue will wind its way through downtown Oklahoma City before ending at Scissortail Park.
Officials say the parade, which commemorates the Oklahoma City Thunder’s first NBA championship, is expected to last one and a half hours. The Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers in seven games Sunday night to win the NBA Finals. 
“The day of the parade will forever live in the annals of our city’s history,” Mayor David Holt said in a statement. “It is a celebration of our team’s historic accomplishment and our city’s renaissance.”
Streets surrounding the parade route will be closed. Additionally, most city services will not be available Tuesday,  including city offices, trash collection, municipal court, the Household Hazardous Waste Collection Center and Animal Welfare. Oklahoma City streetcars will not operate until the parade ends.
“Conducting city business in person downtown will be almost impossible on parade day, so I decided to close,” said Craig Freeman, the city manager, in a statement. “Closing will also make more parking available for the thousands of people attending the parade.”
He said utilities, parks and public works crews are needed to support parade operations.
City parks outside the downtown area, summer camps, gymnasiums, pools as well as community, recreation and senior centers will operate as normal.
The Oklahoma City’s Office of Emergency Management is coordinating the public safety planning for the parade. 
Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Dillon Quirk said there are no credible threats, but urged attendees to stay as close to family as possible, especially if children are present. A multitude of officers will be present and on standby.
The parade will also be streamed on the Thunder mobile app and on YouTube at OKCThunder.

Free.,US Senate mega-bill drops requirement states help pay for SNAP program,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-mega-bill-drops-requirement-states-help-pay-snap-program,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democrats have succeeded in eliminating more than a dozen policy changes from Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” after successfully arguing before the chamber’s parliamentarian that the elements didn’t comply with the strict rules that go along with writing a budget reconciliation bill.Removed is language that would have transferred some of the cost of running the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to state governments, potentially leaving states on the hook for billions in added spending on the food aid program for lower-income people.Democrats also fended off a proposal to eliminate funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which fields complaints on banking and other financial institutions, and another that sought to bar federal district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions. Among the contested items that remained, Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley announced in a social media post that his years-long effort to reauthorize the Radiation Exposure Compensation Fund, or RECA, passed what’s known on Capitol Hill as the “Byrd bath” test.“Terrific news for Missouri, radiation survivors, and MAHA: RECA has passed the ‘Byrd bath’ - Democrats did not strip it - and will be in the final bill,” Hawley wrote, referring to the Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again slogan. “Huge step forward #MAHA.”Democrats to continue challengesBudget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., has cheered many of the parliamentarian's rulings, though Republican committee chairs say they’ll look for ways to rewrite the various proposals.“Today, we were advised by the Senate Parliamentarian that several more provisions in this Big Beautiful Betrayal of a bill will be subject to the Byrd Rule — and Democrats plan to challenge every part of this bill that hurts working families and violates this process,” Merkley wrote in a statement released Saturday night. “Republicans’ relentless attack on middle class families in order to fund tax breaks for billionaires is a slap in the face to working families everywhere, and Democrats are fighting back.”  The changes could create several issues for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and eventually for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who need nearly every GOP lawmaker in Congress to vote for the sweeping tax and spending cuts package in order for it to become law.The House voted 215-214 to approve its version of the bill in May, but since the Senate is making substantial changes, the House will have to vote on the measure again before it can go to President Donald Trump for his signature. GOP leaders hope to complete all that before the Fourth of July.Republicans are using reconciliation, instead of moving the bill through the regular legislative process, to avoid needing Democratic votes to get past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.But the lower threshold for passing a reconciliation bill comes with several requirements, including that all of the proposals in the package have an impact on spending or revenues that’s not “merely incidental.”The Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s official scorekeeper who holds a detailed understanding of the rules and procedures, examines each of those policies and hears from both Republicans and Democrats before issuing the rulings.The Byrd bath began last week behind closed doors and will continue for at least several more days. Once it concludes, Senate GOP leaders can move the bill to the floor, where members of both parties can call for votes on as many amendments as they want.SNAP programAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., released a written statement defending his committee’s bill after the parliamentarian ruled several provisions must go to comply with the rules.“To rein in federal spending and protect taxpayer dollars the committee is pursuing meaningful reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to improve efficiency, accountability and integrity,” Boozman wrote. “We are continuing to examine options that comply with Senate rules to achieve savings through budget reconciliation to ensure SNAP serves those who truly need it while being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.”The parliamentarian ruled the committee erred in including language that would have shifted some of the cost of the SNAP program to state governments if they didn’t meet an efficiency benchmark before 2028.A proposal to eliminate SNAP eligibility for “immigrants who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents, with certain exceptions,” was also determined not to comply with the rules, according to a press release from Merkley.Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, ranking member on the committee, wrote the parliamentarian’s ruling “made clear that Senate Republicans cannot use their partisan budget to shift major nutrition assistance costs to the states that would have inevitably led to major cuts.“While Republicans’ proposed cuts to SNAP will still be devastating to families, farmers, and independent grocers across the country, we will keep fighting to protect families in need. Instead of a rushed partisan process, Republicans should work with us to lower costs for Americans and pass a bipartisan Farm Bill that works for all farmers and rural America.”Consumer financial agency victory for DemsThe Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee’s proposal to eliminate funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Congress established in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also doesn’t comply with the rules, under the parliamentarian’s ruling.Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ranking member on the panel, wrote in a statement that the GOP’s proposal for the CFPB represented “a reckless, dangerous attack on consumers and would lead to more Americans being tricked and trapped by giant financial institutions and put the stability of our entire financial system at risk–all to hand out tax breaks to billionaires.”But committee Chairman Tim Scott, R-S.C., wrote in a separate statement that he remains “committed to advancing legislation that cuts waste and duplication in our federal government and saves taxpayer dollars.”Scott listed provisions that he said will remain.“As it stands now, the Banking Committee’s reconciliation provisions will delay the implementation of Section 1071 of Dodd-Frank, which reduces CFPB spending and protects the privacy and data of small business owners; rescind unused funds earmarked for green initiatives to give HUD discretion in funding critical housing programs; and save taxpayer dollars by eliminating an unnecessary reserve fund at the SEC,” Scott wrote. “My colleagues and I remain committed to cutting wasteful spending at the CFPB and will continue working with the Senate parliamentarian on the Committee's provisions.”Judges and injunctionsThe parliamentarian told lawmakers that various elements of the Judiciary Committee’s bill don’t comply with the rules, including an attempt to block federal district court judges from issuing nationwide preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders.The issue has become a thorn in Trump’s side during the past few months as he’s watched the courts block several of his executive orders and other unilateral administration actions.The Judiciary Committee’s reconciliation bill cannot block the Department of Justice from awarding Byrne JAG and COPS grants to “sanctuary cities.” The bill also can’t send funding to local and state governments for the purpose of “apprehending aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States.”Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, did not respond to a request for comment, but a committee spokesperson wrote in an email to States Newsroom that “Democrats are clinging to their radical open borders legacy by fighting to keep criminal migrants in the United States.“Republicans are committed to enforcing the rule of law, and will continue using all available avenues to secure our borders, clean up the mess left by the Biden-Harris administration’s disastrous policies and ensure courts operate according to lawful and constitutional standards.”Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, ranking member on the committee, issued a statement calling the bill’s policies ""an attempted power grab by our Republican colleagues that we would not stand for.”""Here’s what Senate Republicans attempted to sneak into their so-called Big, Beautiful Bill: a provision intended to limit the ability of individuals and organizations to challenge lawless Trump Administration executive actions by putting those potential plaintiffs on the hook for millions of dollars; and a provision conditioning grant eligibility on a state or locality’s compliance with federal immigration policies,” Durbin wrote.Artificial intelligence and statesThe parliamentarian didn’t, however, remove all of the proposals contested by Democrats.Language that would prevent local and state governments from regulating artificial intelligence for the next decade if those jurisdictions want to receive money from a $500 million fund does meet the reconciliation requirements and can remain in the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation’s bill.But that doesn’t mean the provision will stay in the bill moving forward, since several GOP lawmakers have expressed concern about potentially tying the hands of local and state governments when it comes to AI.Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote in a social media post after she voted for the House’s bill that she had no idea about the AI provision. That chamber’s package barred state and local AI regulation for a decade without tying it to any funding stream.“We have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous,” Greene wrote. “This needs to be stripped out in the Senate.“When the OBBB comes back to the House for approval after Senate changes, I will not vote for it with this in it.”",,,,2025-06-23 17:04:39.271404

(Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)A new poll shows Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani gaining on Andrew Cuomo in Tuesday’s New York City Democratic mayoral primary, and Ron DeSantis is concerned.
“I’m not a political prognosticator, not knowing what will happen in that mayor’s race that’s going on right now,” he told reporters and onlookers at a press conference in Clearwater Beach on Monday.
“But I will tell you, if that leftist does win, you’re going to see Palm Beach real estate go up another 20%. That will happen very quickly. Because as bad as some of what they’ve had, this is like [Bill] De Blasio on steroids.”
“That leftist” DeSantis wouldn’t or couldn’t name is a Queens state assemblyman who has overtaken Cuomo in the final round of ranked-choice voting in the Democratic mayoral primary election, according to a Emerson College, PIX 11, and The Hill survey released Monday.
DeSantis’ comment about more New Yorkers retreating to Palm Beach if Mamdani does win echoed comments made last week by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. She told a television station that she opposed Mamdani’s proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy, saying, “I don’t want to lose more people to Palm Beach. We’ve lost enough.”
More than 151,00 New Yorkers fled to Florida between 2018 and 2022, according to data from the Citizens Budget Commission, a New York fiscal watchdog group. A net of 30,000 New Yorkers fled the city to either Palm Beach or Miami-Dade counties in that period, taking with them a combined $9 billion in income.
“I follow these things because it affects us,” DeSantis continued. “When the current Chicago Mayor [Brandon Johnson] got elected, Naples real estate went up because it’s like they had bad and they elected worse, and so some people would say, ‘We’re just going to get out of Dodge.’”
The general election for mayor of New York City takes place in November.

(Jack Yen Joy Photography | Getty Images)Proposed cuts to Medicaid in Congress’ budget reconciliation bill would have “detrimental” effects to communities in West Virginia, the head of a state rural health organization told reporters Monday.
Seven rural hospitals in West Virginia would be at risk of closure if the cuts to health care in the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” become law, Rich Sutphin, executive director of the West Virginia Rural Health Care Association, said Monday.  
That number includes one independent, rural hospital in West Virginia, according to a report released Monday by Families USA, a national nonpartisan organization that advocates for health care consumers. 
Sutphin said the cuts would affect a rural, independent hospital in central West Virginia that is the sole provider of primary and emergency care for six or seven counties. The hospital, which he did not name, also operates an emergency medical service and a skilled nursing facility, he said.
“If this hospital were to close, those communities in those seven counties comprising thousands of West Virginians would lose access to all of those services,” Sutphin said. “So not only are they losing access to primary care, losing their Medicaid coverage, and probably delaying treatment for things like diabetes and heart disease, which are precursors for heart attacks and strokes, they’re going to lose access to emergency medical services to get them to tertiary care centers. 
“So these types of cuts are really going to be detrimental to communities within West Virginia with real impacts, and almost immediately,” Sutphin said.
Sutphin’s comments came during a press call Monday hosted by Families USA.
Nationally, about 400 rural, independent hospitals in 26 states are at risk of closing if the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” is signed into law, the report says. 
“Many rural independent hospitals are already facing tough times, many with negative net revenue, and this bill would push many more into the red,” Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, said in a statement Monday. “These proposed Medicaid cuts and coverage terminations could be the final blow for many independent rural hospitals across America. Medicaid is often the biggest line item in these rural hospitals’ budgets, and reducing those paying patients and increasing uncompensated care, on top of direct cuts, would be devastating.” 
The U.S. House of Representatives last month narrowly passed a version of the bill that would cut Medicaid by more than $700 billion — the largest in the program’s history. The bill would impose work reporting requirements and cause roughly 15 million people to lose their health care coverage over the next few years, analysts say.
The Senate version of the bill would cut Medicaid even more and expand the proposed work requirements for the program.
A report earlier this month from the Sheps Center for Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that more than 300 rural hospitals, including seven in West Virginia, are at risk of closure because of cuts in the bill. 
Rhonda Rogombé, health policy analyst for the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the additional paperwork requirements the bill contemplates would cause people to lose their health coverage, despite otherwise qualifying for the program. 
“This will impact entire communities… hospitals in West Virginia that rely on Medicaid are at risk of closure, and when a hospital closes, that impacts everybody, not just enrollees and Medicaid,” she said.
West Virginia Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice, both Republicans, have said they support work requirements for the health care program. 
“Biblically, you’re supposed to work,” Justice reportedly said in an interview with The Independent. “We have taken the dignity and the hope and the belief away from a lot of people where they are hopeless, they think they can’t. “
In a recent interview with CNBC, Capito said those who need SNAP or Medicaid benefits should get them, but said there are people on the programs who don’t qualify.
“But what’s happened here is there are people on those benefits, both benefits programs that don’t deserve to be on there or don’t qualify and have stayed on for years and years for one reason or another,” Capito said. “We need to flush that out. Get rid of the waste, the fraud, the abuse of the system so that it is there for the basic folks who need it.”
Rogombe said the changes to the Affordable Care Act provisions in the bill will have a significant impact in West Virginia. The Senate bill would raise costs for people enrolled in plans through the state’s health insurance marketplace by failing to extend tax credits set to expire at the end of the year. 
“We will see the uninsured rate, which has been historically low for since the adoption of these flexibilities within the ACA plan, we will see historically high uninsured rates again, and that will have devastating impacts on quality of life in our state,” she said.

Ned Lamont sided with suburban towns and Republican legislators who had urged him to nix H.B. 5002 as an intrusion into local zoning.,"Gov. Ned Lamont ended nearly three weeks of public rumination and private negotiation about the fate of an omnibus housing bill Monday, siding with suburban opponents and Republican legislators who had urged a veto of the measure as an intrusion into local zoning.
Lamont, a Democrat whose overwhelming reelection in 2022 came on the strength of suburban support, praised the goals behind House Bill 5002 and decried much of the opposition as based on misrepresentations, yet he ultimately bowed to those concerns.
“I think we can make it better. I think the only way to really make it work is if you have buy-in from the local communities. And I think the vast majority of those communities want to do the right thing,” Lamont told reporters in a press conference in his office at the state Capitol.
Lamont also confirmed a veto of Senate Bill 8, legislation that would have provided jobless benefits to striking workers, consistent with statements he repeatedly made prior to passage. The deadline for acting on the two bills was Tuesday.
But his public skepticism about House Bill 5002, a measure his administration helped negotiate, was recent and unexpected. It blossomed since the legislature adjourned June 4, and opponents led by CT169Strong and the conservative Yankee Institute raised alarms and urged local officials to demand a veto.
“There are about 2,000 bills, and I focus on probably a half dozen,” Lamont said, responding to questions pressing him to explain his short path from support for a priority of the legislature’s Democratic majority to a veto demanded by its GOP minority. “I probably should have focused on this one sooner.”
HB 5002 was drawn to address a critical housing shortage by requiring municipalities to set “fair share” goals for affordable housing, prioritizing state aid to communities that build housing, and streamlining approval for so-called “middle housing,” defined as a building with two to nine units.
Lamont said the community-by-community “fair share” goals for affordable housing were “a planning document,” not a mandate as opponents claimed, yet those false claims contributed to his veto decision.
“I think this, you know, crossed the line for a lot of folks, in particular, when it comes to dictating or suggesting the number of units you ought to have,” Lamont said. He clarified the bill does not dictate the number of units a community should produce.
Housing advocates found his answers confounding. They noted his administration was privy to the bill’s development, and the governor acknowledged he was acting on opposition talking points that he largely discounted as based on misrepresenting the details of the 41-section bill.
“That’s absolutely astounding,” said Erin Boggs, the executive director of the Open Communities Alliance. “The governor’s office was directly involved in negotiating this bill. His specific complaints about target numbers for each community to plan around appear based more on complaints from municipalities and NIMBY advocates who do not understand what the bill says rather than legitimate issues with the proposal, and should not have been enough to trigger a veto.”
Equally confusing, Boggs and other advocates said, was that the principle for going forward appeared to be finding a consensus from officials in municipalities whose zoning either bars multifamily housing of three or more units or requires special permitting. That consensus, they said, has been elusive for decades.
“Thousands of working-class and middle-class people can’t afford to rent or own a home in Connecticut, making this veto disappointing and short-sighted,” said Melvin Medina of the Connecticut Project Action Fund. “Nixing this bill suggests a lack of urgency and a commitment to steady habits that aren’t delivering results.”
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, defended the “fair share” provision as a necessary prod to act on providing affordable housing.
“I have no regrets about fighting for these families. It was not dumb, and it was never wrong to be a champion for their cause,” Rojas said. “Housing reform is hard. It’s even harder in the world of social media outrage machines that exploit the currents of the moment, flooding feeds with disinformation and scare tactics. But we do not give up because it is hard. We press on because it is necessary.”
Lamont called his veto “reluctant” and called for stakeholders, including municipal officials, to craft a new version in the next 90 days. Without committing to any, he praised some of 5002’s provisions, such as one that would have required zoning regulations to allow small middle housing projects in commercial zones “as of right.”
“Commercial ‘as of right’ makes really good sense to me,” Lamont said. “Rather than have an empty, underused office building, people can convert that, do that, you know, more quickly and readily. But I think we have to do it the way that people buy in.”
Lamont tweaked Republican legislators, who voted as a bloc against the bill, as inconsistent when it comes to encouraging growth and bemoaning bureaucracy. Those attributes, he said, disappear when it comes to housing.
“It’s sort of interesting to me that Republicans are usually the ones that are pro-growth and want to get rid of the red tape and over-regulation,” Lamont said. “Instead, in this case, it’s the Republicans who are sort of slow growth and very happy with the local regulation.”
But Lamont retreated towards a posture of deferring to local control.
“I’m not happy with the local regulation. I’m not happy with the, you know, the local red tape, but I want the towns to take the lead,” Lamont said.
He drew a distinction between “the veto crowd” and the “people of goodwill” who oversee planning and zoning.
“The veto crowd, they don’t have any solutions. They don’t have any constructive  solutions. They’re saying, ‘Hell no.’ I’m not going to win them over,” Lamont said. “But I think when it comes to our towns and cities and first selectmen and planning and zoning people, people of goodwill who know how important it is for our towns and our state to continue growing, we’re going to get it done.”
Lamont had no detailed answers on what, if anything, the state should do regarding communities that do not, in his words, “buy in” to changes that encourage the construction of affordable housing or streamline processes that can stretch for months or even years.
He viewed those reluctant communities as a minority, and overall he saw Connecticut making progress — an assessment not shared by the housing advocates.
“The data is clear: decades of exclusionary zoning have severely limited the production of homes, particularly the more diverse types of homes our population needs in the places they need them,” said Desegregate Connecticut, an affiliate of the Regional Plan Association.
Connecticut ranks 49th in housing production and has the lowest vacancy rate in the U.S. About 50% of renters and 30% of homeowners are “cost burdened,” spending at least 30% of household income on housing.
Republicans praised the veto.
“Let’s now go back to the drawing board, work together across the aisle and find real bipartisan solutions that address housing affordability — without gutting local control,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “Our towns and cities deserve a seat at the table — not a mandate from Hartford.”
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, offered praise and criticism.
“The governor made the logical call by vetoing H.B. 5002, though he has offered little vision for a path forward,” he said. “Trying to make housing more affordable in Connecticut without confronting the broader policies that drive up the cost of living here is a flawed strategy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-020-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 17:04:39.271404

There were 4,155,487 Florida residents enrolled in the program as of May 30, the latest available data. That’s 68,110 fewer people since December 2024 and 643,662 fewer people than in January 2024.
Florida’s Medicaid caseload was at an all-time high in state fiscal year 2022-23, when total caseload for the safety net program was 5,575,548. The following year, the total caseload dropped by 13.3% to 4,836,670. Economists predicted there would be 4,226,199 enrolled in the program for state fiscal year 2025-26, which starts July 1 and ends June 30, 2026.
Legislators relied on those estimates when drafting the FY 25-26 Medicaid budget. That budget earmarks $36.53 billion to the state Agency for Health Care Administration, the agency that houses Florida’s Medicaid program.
Florida requires most of its Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans. As such, a breakout of Medicaid enrollment data shows that about 72% of the beneficiaries belong to a Medicaid managed care plan, or 3,006,980 as of May. Enrollment in managed care plans is down by 7,682 from January and 453,638 people from January 2024.

John Cavanaugh of Omaha speaks with reporters after the core legislative proposal seeking to help implement medical cannabis stalls in committee. April 17, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who in early June joined the race to replace U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., announced over 20 endorsements Monday of his bid in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.
Cavanaugh, the son of a Democratic congressman in the Omaha area in the 1970s also named John, quickly secured the endorsements of two prominent Democrats who have served as Nebraska governors and U.S. senators, Bob Kerrey and Ben Nelson. 
“I am supporting John Cavanaugh because I know that John will be able to hit the ground running and has a proven record of standing up for people in Nebraska,” Nelson said in a statement.
Cavanaugh also grabbed endorsements from seven current state senators, including as State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha. He also secured the backing of former state senators and some elected officials in Omaha and Douglas County, including Omaha City Councilman Danny Begley and Douglas County Commissioner Jim Cavanaugh.
Earlier this month, former Omaha State Sen. Tony Vargas — who narrowly lost twice to Bacon in the Omaha-based 2nd District race — endorsed political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell’s Democratic bid.
Powell had previously announced endorsements from some Cavanaugh colleagues in the Legislature, including from Omaha’s State Sens. Margo Juarez and Dunixi Guereca, in addition to other elected officials in NE-02, which includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and parts of suburban Sarpy County.
Powell, who is running as an outsider, has the support of some top local Democratic donors from her time leading the nonpartisan PAC Women Who Run, a group that encouraged more women to consider running for office.

Cavanaugh is part of a local political dynasty. His sister, State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, serves with him in the Legislature.
Powell and John Cavanaugh are the two highest-profile Democratic candidates in the race. Also running are Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis. Rumblings from some Democratic circles have speculated about a third major candidate considering a bid.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey lawmaker wants to bar the disclosure of state legislators’ home addresses after a gunman killed Minnesota’s House speaker and left another lawmaker critically wounded earlier this month.
Assemblyman Chris DePhillips’ proposal would add legislators to the list of officials whose personal information is shielded under Daniel’s Law, which currently prohibits the publication of home addresses of judges and law enforcement personnel.
“We need to do something on our end to protect public officials who have made the step to serve the public,” DePhillips (R-Bergen) told the New Jersey Monitor. “The least we can do is not just protect them but to protect their loved ones, protect their children, protect their grandchildren who are not public officials and should not literally be caught in the crossfire.”
On June 14, a gunman fatally shot Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home. Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were critically wounded during a second attack by the same gunman.
Federal and state authorities have charged Vance Boelter with murder over the shootings. Officials have said Boelter, posing as a police officer, drove to the homes of two other lawmakers who were unharmed.
Daniel’s Law was enacted in New Jersey after the attempted assassination of U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas and named after her son, Daniel Anderl, who was killed during the attempt on her life.
Officials across the span of government — from judges to legislators to law enforcement personnel — have for years warned that violent threats against them were on the rise and have, at times, urged more protections for personal information that could be used to aid such targeted crimes.
 Assemblyman Christopher DePhillips said shielding the home addresses of state lawmakers would not only protect them but also their families from being “caught in the crossfire.” (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
“It’s certainly something I think that we should consider extending to legislators in light of the tragedy we saw unfold in Minneapolis,” said DePhillips, who was visiting family in Minneapolis just minutes away from the shootings last weekend.
The assemblyman’s effort to bar the disclosure of lawmakers’ addresses isn’t the first.
In 2022, Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) sponsored legislation that would have shielded the addresses of elected officials and candidates for public office from disclosure on documents obtained through the Open Public Records Act. Then in 2023, the Legislature amended its ethics code to allow lawmakers to leave primary and secondary residences belonging to them or their immediate family off the financial disclosure forms they are required to file annually.
Greenwald’s proposal, which did not use Daniel’s Law as a framework, won unanimous approval from an Assembly committee but did not advance further.
“I hate to say that we were prophetic on this, but I saw the trend two years ago, and that trend has only gotten worse,” said Greenwald, who knew Hortman through work at the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
At the time, the Municipal Clerks Association of New Jersey warned of logistical hurdles to implementation.
There was no statewide registry of current and former elected officials, Kim-Marie White, then the association’s president, told legislators in 2022. White said then that requiring candidates’ and officials’ addresses to be redacted on documents returned in answer to records requests would be “a freaking nightmare.”
“I’m sure we can put our heads together and address those issues,” DePhillips said.
Kim Macellaro, the clerks association’s second vice president, did not return a request for comment on the new legislation.
DePhillips’ proposal is narrower than Greenwald’s, applying only to legislators, though Greenwald on Monday said the two bills were substantially similar and could be merged into a single, bipartisan plan.
“I’m glad Chris is thinking this way. I’ve known Chris for 35 years, so it doesn’t surprise me. He’s a good person, and I’m excited to try to get something done,” Greenwald said.
State legislators account for an exceedingly small share of the state’s elected officials, and their identities are more easily tracked than local officials spread through New Jersey’s more than 500 municipalities. But there are still hurdles to shielding their addresses.
Candidates for the Legislature — including incumbents seeking reelection — are required to disclose their addresses on forms filed with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission. Language in existing law would allow redactions of documents filed with the election commission — which span decades for some lawmakers — once Daniel’s Law protections are extended to legislators.
Joe Donohue, the commission’s deputy director, last year urged tweaks to Daniel’s Law, warning the statute requires the Election Law Enforcement Commission to violate its own enabling legislation by mandating it redact addresses of some donors whose information is shielded by the law.
“We can technically hide the addresses of donors, but then what are we here for?” Donohue said last May. “We’re a disclosure agency. It’s just directly counter to our purpose.”
Office-seekers do not always include their home addresses on Election Law Enforcement Commission forms. Sometimes, they use a post office box or the address of a campaign staffer, typically the treasurer.

Wes Moore wrote on social media that he was in close contact with the Maryland Military Department “to ensure Marylanders at home and abroad are protected.”“As someone who has worn the uniform of this country and deployed overseas alongside some of America’s greatest warriors and patriots, I know the profound sacrifices our soldiers and their families make every day,” he said.Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen, on social media, thanked Noem for briefing the governors and praised the president for his “leadership and decisiveness yesterday to devastate the Iranian nuclear program and the threat it posed to American national security.” Pillen added that there were currently no threats to Nebraska.North Carolina’s Democratic Gov. Josh Stein wrote on social media that the meeting with Noem focused on public safety.“Public safety officials in North Carolina are working in close coordination with local, state, and federal partners to remain vigilant against any retaliatory threat, whether physical or cyber,” he said.Arizona’s Democratic Gov.

Brian Kemp also wrote on social media that potential retaliatory attacks from Iran were discussed at the meeting.“We are coordinating with law enforcement on all levels as we closely monitor any possible threats,” Kemp said.Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey wrote on social media that there are no threats to her state, but that her administration is continuing to “coordinate with state, local and federal partners to closely monitor the situation.”Following the meeting, Missouri’s Republican Gov.

Hundreds of seniors across Delaware received free dental care this spring thanks to a partnership between Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware and United Concordia Dental.
The mobile dental clinics, held between April 22 and May 1, traveled to several locations including Dover, Lewes, Millsboro, New Castle, and Rehoboth Beach.
The initiative focused on Highmark Medicare Advantage members, offering essential services such as dental exams, x-rays, cleanings, and fluoride treatments—all at no cost.

“We are incredibly pleased with the positive response to these free dental clinics,” said Tom Fitzpatrick, president of Commercial Business for Highmark Health plans. “These events allowed us to directly address the oral health needs of our Medicare Advantage members and connect them with valuable resources for ongoing care.”
For seniors who required further treatment, the clinics also offered referrals to in-network dental providers.
Dr. Roosevelt Allen, Chief Dental Officer at United Concordia Dental, emphasized the broader health benefits of oral care.
“Taking good care of your teeth and gums can lead to better oral and overall health at every life stage,” said Roosevelt Allen, DDS, MAGD, ABGD, chief dental officer, United Concordia Dental. “That’s why we were pleased to partner with Highmark to bring these essential dental services to seniors in Delaware at no cost and help them be their healthiest.”

The attack — which Connecticut officials said involved a sow with cubs — is the latest in a series of bear encounters in the state in recent years that have prompted lawmakers to weigh solutions to the problem, including through a potential hunt.
After a series of debates, however, lawmakers adjourned their legislative session earlier this month without passing any significant bills addressing bear population management.
“Legislation will not prevent human-bear conflicts,” said state Sen. Rick Lopes, D- New Britain, who serves as co-chair of the legislature’s Environment Committee. “But at the same time, if the number of conflicts are escalating, we should be doing something to address that.”
The incident in North Canaan occurred early Monday morning when the victim stepped between his dog and the bear, which had cubs present nearby, according to Department of Energy and Environmental Protection spokesman James Fowler.
The victim, who was not named by DEEP, sustained scratches to his chest and declined medical treatment at the scene. His dog was unharmed.
Fowler said state environmental conservation officers have set a trap in the area in hopes of capturing the bear. However, he said that a lack distinctive markings on the bear in question would make it impossible for officials to confirm its identity. 
Any bear caught in the trap will be taken in by wildlife officials and conditioned to avoid humans — using negative stimuli such as loud noises — before being released back into the wild.
Connecticut is home to between 1,000 and 1,200 black bears, with the population concentrated in the hills of Litchfield County in the northwestern part of the state.
As bears have expanded their numbers and range, however, they’ve come into increasing contact with farmers, suburban homeowners and even city dwellers. Last year DEEP recorded 67 home entries by bears, tying an all-time record.
Several attacks similar to the one that took place Monday have also fueled calls for a hunt. In 2022, a bear attacked and injured a 10-year-old boy in Morris, which is also located in Litchfield County. 
Opponents, however, argue that bear conflicts can be effectively reduced through nonlethal means, and by raising public awareness about limiting their access to food sources.
“The bears are coming around because they’re looking for food,” said Annie Hornish of the CT Coalition to Protect Bears. “Hunting is not an effective remedy.”
In a statement describing the incident, Fowler also pointed to the agency’s tips for avoiding conflicts with bears, such as securing trash in bear-proof containers and removing bird feeders during the summer and fall. There were bird feeders at the property where Monday’s incident occurred, he noted.
“Residents with pets or walking dogs in areas with known bear activity should also maintain high awareness of their surroundings,” Fowler said. “Carrying a bear deterrent, such as a bear whistle or bear spray, is recommended and we advise owners to keep their pets leashed, at all times, while on walks.”
Earlier this year, lawmakers considered a bill supported by DEEP to authorize a limited bear hunt that became subject to debate between members of the House and Senate. 
After an early version of the bill was pared back to focus on circumstances in which a farmer can kill a bear that is damaging crops or livestock, members of the Senate voted to add the hunting provisions back in. That prompted members of the House to make their own changes by again removing the hunting language and instead ordering DEEP to come up with a “bear management plan.” 
By that point, however, there were just a few hours left before the deadline for lawmakers to conclude their work and the bear bill died without a getting to a final vote. 
Lopes said he expects to resurrect the proposal for a hunt next year, and that it is more likely to pass if conflicts continue to escalate. 
“It was kind of a long-shot,” this year, he said. “Every year is getting closer.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-21-at-8.51.01-AM.png,,,2025-06-23 16:06:00.306880

It presents an opportunity to instill essential life skills, like financial literacy. This season is an ideal time for parents to introduce their kids to the fundamentals of money management, including saving, budgeting, and responsible spending. 
To help prepare for the year ahead, Chase is hosting a Back-to-School Family Finance event that will feature fun activities, financial health workshops, and more for kids of all ages. 

When—Saturday, June 28 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Where—Mississippi Civil Rights Museum (222 North St., #2205, Jackson, MS 39201)
What—Attendees will enjoy free haircuts, interactive games, and financial health activities designed for all ages to learn the importance of budgeting, smart spending, and the valuable resources available to them. Plus, while supplies last, students will receive a free backpack filled with school supplies.

In addition to joining Chase at the June 28 event, here are a few important lessons parents and kids can learn to help on the first day of school and beyond.
Start With Saving
Whether it’s allowance, gifts, or earnings from a summer job, teaching kids to track and save their money is essential in developing good financial habits. Saving toward specific goals and understanding the time it takes to reach those can help children grasp the true value of money.
Chase provides families with the tools and resources to make saving easy, like Autosave, by setting up automatic monthly transfers from your Chase checking account to your savings account. All managed through the ﷟Chase Mobile® App, parents can help their child set a savings goal to ensure they build a strong financial foundation. 
Next, Begin Budgeting 
As you approach the tween and teen years, financial needs and desires for independence will evolve. They might take on part-time jobs, save up for larger goals (like a car), and begin managing more of their own finances. This is a great opportunity for them to learn the basics of budgeting. 
Chase’s Monthly Budgeting Worksheets help make this process simple. Start by entering monthly income and expenses to help your teen differentiate “needs” and “wants.” This helps them see where their money is going and is important as they begin cashing and spending their first paychecks.
Then, Grow Their Finances 
Transitioning from high school to college or stepping into the real-world post-graduation comes with a new set of responsibilities. Amidst managing studies, jobs, and future planning, young adults need both guidance and practical tools to help.
The Chase Mobile app tracks earnings, savings, and expenses, and makes it easy to send and receive money with Zelle®.  
Just as kids progress from one grade to the next, they can grow their understanding and management of money too. Opening their first bank account is a great complement to these financial lessons. Check out Chase First BankingSM, Chase High School CheckingSM, and Chase College CheckingSM, to see which account works best for your student or, learn more at chase.com/StudentBanking.

In a 1998 ruling in Pro Choice Mississippi v. Fordice, the state high court said the state constitution provides Mississippians a right to abortion.
Late last year, a Hinds County judge ruled members of AAPLOG did not have standing to pursue a lawsuit to overturn the 1998 decision because they have not been harmed by the court ruling. AAPLOG, represented by new public interest law firm American Dream Legal, is appealing that ruling, and asking the state Supreme Court to “clarify whether Mississippi considers elective abortion a crime or a constitutional right,” according to a press release.
Based on another Mississippi case, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the decades old Roe v. Wade right to abortion via the U.S. Constitution. The Mississippi Legislature has passed laws that prohibit most all abortions in the state and there are no clinics in Mississippi offering abortions. 
But the 1998 state Supreme Court decision holding that the state constitution provides a right to abortion has never been overturned and remains on the books. 
American Dream Legal in a statement said Mississippi’s criminal ban on abortion conflicts with the Fordice decision, and  this has AAPLOG physicians “caught between conflicting legal duties: refer patients and risk prosecution under state law — or refuse to refer and risk professional ruin.”
 “The people of Mississippi enacted a law that protected unborn life and took down the U.S. Supreme Court’s abuse of judicial authority in Roe v. Wade,” said Aaron Rice, attorney for AAPLOG and CEO of American Dream Legal. “It is only fitting that we likewise put an end to efforts by the courts in our own state to impose abortion by judicial fiat.”
In the Hinds County case, both the state, through Attorney General Lynn Fitch, and pro-abortion rights supporters argued that the doctors did not have standing. It’s unclear whether the high court will hear the appeal. In recent years, the state Supreme Court has taken a limited view of who has standing in various cases.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/07092235/18eea-justice-scalescopy.jpg,,,2025-06-23 16:06:00.306880

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)CLEARWATER BEACH – Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation Monday designed to provide financial relief to condominium owners who have faced serious financial strains from a tightened regulations enacted following the 2021 Surfside condo collapse in South Florida.
That tragedy, in which a 12-story condominium in northeast Miami-Dade County collapsed without warning, killing 98 people, prompted the Legislature to pass a law in 2022 that mandated that all condo developments undergo certain inspections — with condominium associations ordered to maintain sufficient reserve funds to repair maintenance problems revealed in those inspections.
To pay for those repairs, condo associations began tapping unit owners with expensive special assessments and higher monthly fees, leading to complaints from condo owners that they were being forced out of their homes because of those increased costs.
The legislative response (HB 913) signed by the governor on Monday allows associations to secure credit lines and invest funds to pay for building repairs instead of immediately raising large amounts of cash from owners. It carves out condos with only three residential stories from those inspections. And it extends the deadline for certain associations to have a structural integrity reserve study completed by Dec. 31, 2025, rather than Dec. 31, 2024.
“People need to be able to afford to live in these units and, especially if they’re getting assessments on things that maybe they do need to be done but it isn’t like the integrity of the structure is at risk here, they need to be able to work those out, and you shouldn’t have this mandate applied in that way,” DeSantis said while hosting a press conference at Island Way Grill on Clearwater Beach.
Earlier calls for this legislation 
The governor began calling for the Legislature to deal with the emerging problems resulting from the 2022 condo legislation last summer, but lawmakers resisted his efforts. Then-Senate President Kathleen Passidomo said last August that the issue could be addressed during the regular legislative session, and she and outgoing House Speaker Paul Renner resisted a second request DeSantis made while holding a roundtable discussion on the issue in Pinellas County last September.
Flash forward to this January, when DeSantis again called on lawmakers to address the issue as part of a special legislative session that would also deal with immigration, reforms to citizen-led constitutional amendments, and hurricane relief. And again, the Legislature rebuffed his request.
“I know a lot of people were really disappointed in the leadership, particularly in the House of Representatives, for not being willing to address it at that time and, quite frankly, it didn’t look that promising through a lot of the legislative session,” the governor said Monday, before adding that the condo-owning public motivated lawmakers to pass something of substance this year.
“I think that this will provide some relief, but it’s also a very complicated set of issues that you’re dealing with, and if this legislation takes hold on July 1, hopefully we’ll see a lot of good things, but to the extent that there needs to be some cleanup next year when the Legislature reconvenes, we’d got to be willing to do that,”  he said.
“We all attempted to make sure that there was never a collapse again, like what happened at Surfside” said Clearwater Republican Sen. Ed Hooper. “We overreacted, probably, and now it’s time to make the change. People were losing their homes. Elderly people were losing their condos because they could not afford to make the increase and their monthly HOA [home owner association] fees. That’s just wrong.”
Revisions to My Safe Florida Condo Pilot
DeSantis signed a second bill (HB 393) Monday revising the My Safe Florida Condo Pilot Project. The new law prohibits a condo association from applying for a grant or an inspection under the program unless it has complied with milestone inspection and structural integrity reserve requirements.
It now says that only 75% of unit owners, rather than 100%, must approve applying for the grant. It revises the roof improvements eligible for funding and clarifies that all grants under the program must be matched on the basis of $1 provided by the condo associations for every $2 provided by the state towards the actual cost of the program.
Ronni Drimmer is president of a condominium association board at a 55-plus community in Clearwater. She thanked the governor for providing relief for condo owners, but went a bit off script to say that she wished the legislation could do something about the high cost of property insurance at her building.
“At the moment, we don’t have hurricane insurance because they raised the deductible so high at $600,000,” she said. “Then it doesn’t really pay for insurance when a roof is only $500,000. So we’re in a little bit of a precarious situation right now, so I’m hoping something will be done about that.”
Along with Hooper, other Pinellas Republicans in attendance included state Sen. Nick DiCeglie and state Reps. Kim Berfield and Linda Chaney.

Mark Gordon and Northern Mariana Islands Gov. Arnold Palacios listen. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham joined leaders from other western states and U.S. territories Monday in publishing a report that proposes government solutions to make housing more affordable across the region.
A group of bipartisan governors joined Lujan Grisham for the opening news conference of the annual Western Governors’ Association in Santa Fe.
As the organization’s chair, Lujan Grisham has for the past year led its push to expand lower-cost options for places to live. 
The report offers fixes for what it says are zoning and land use laws that impede housing development, slow and complicated permitting systems, not enough financing tools for affordable housing, high home prices and too few construction workers.
During the news conference, Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, called the report a roadmap for how western state governments can catch up on building workforce and affordable housing, including using public lands.
She pointed to state-owned land at the state fairgrounds in Albuquerque, where New Mexico is “moments away” from announcing the results of a competitive bidding process for hiring a master planner who will oversee multi-use development there.
“We are looking at moving the fair and redeveloping a brand new revitalized housing and community neighborhood initiative there,” Lujan Grisham said. In April, she signed legislation giving state officials authority to issue hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds and take other steps to develop the land.
Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican and the association’s immediate past chair, said issues like housing, water and fire resource management have come to the fore with many people moving to the West.
When the states and the federal government come together, Gordon said, “there really are no problems that we can’t successfully address.”
South Dakota’s Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden said he’s impressed with the reception governors have received from the second Trump administration, however, he believes the country’s problems will not be solved in Washington but rather by state governments.
“I’ve been encouraged that we’ve got cabinet secretaries in place, a number of them that are very willing to work with the governors to find solutions,” Rhoden said. 
Several Trump-appointed leaders are scheduled to speak to Western Governors’ Association this week.
When asked about the proposal in Congress for some public lands to at least be nominated to be sold and used for housing, Lujan Grisham said the notion that we don’t need any public lands is likely to be a “non-starter” in New Mexico.
“The process that has been described so far is a problem for a state like New Mexico wherein our public lands, we have a very strong relationship with the openness and they belong to all of us,” Lujan Grisham said. “And selling that to the private sector without a process, without putting New Mexicans first, is, at least for me as a governor, going to be problematic.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he hopes the federal government includes states in a search for federal land that could be used for housing or other uses.
“Coloradans really treasure our access, and it would be a devastating blow to the quality of life, as well as to our economy, if areas were fenced off and the public was denied access,” said Polis, a Democrat.
One of the recommendations in the WGA’s housing report is for Congress to consider legislation to allow agencies beyond the U.S. Forest Service to lease some federal lands for affordable housing used by federal workers and local communities.
“With the concentration of federal lands in the West, leveraging certain parcels for responsible housing development is an additional strategy to address affordable housing shortages,” the report states.

Dan McKee’s administration recently delivered $6.7 million in grants to primary care practices in the Ocean State. (Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)Eighty-five primary care practices in Rhode Island have received a $6.7 million boost from Gov. Dan McKee’s administration, with some practices receiving over $200,000 for recruiting new doctors and accepting new patients.  
Providers who saw some of the biggest boosts from the grants, which were made public last week, included all three of Thundermist Health Center’s locations. Thundermist’s awards ranged from $193,500 to $262,125, the highest overall grant in the batch. Other big grants include $257,625 for Care New England Coventry; $251,625 for Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, $250,500 for Wood River Health in Hope Valley and $212,625 for Brown Health’s Cranston location. 
The grants, which are being managed by the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), opened for applications shortly after an April 29 press conference outlining McKee’s initiatives to repair the state’s ailing primary care infrastructure. At that press conference, state health officials said there were about 520 primary care providers in the Ocean State. The state would need about 300 more doctors to adequately cover the population, according to recent analysis of the All Payer Claims Database by Brown University researchers. 
“Primary care is the foundation of preventive care and overall positive health outcomes,” Richard Charest, EOHHS secretary, said in a June 18 statement. “These grants will support 85 primary care practices in Rhode Island to expand their practices so they can see more patients, which, in turn, will ease the burden on Rhode Islanders seeking access to primary care.”  
The grants are divided into three tiers. Applications for grants closed on May 16. The first tier grants went up to $75,000 and were available to practices that accepted between 25 and 75 new patients, depending on the practice size. Providers have until Oct. 31 to reach target numbers for newly enrolled patients. 
Tier two provides up to $300,000 for practices that recruit new primary care doctors, or established physicians who worked at now-closed practices. Practices have to document the hires and use of funds by year’s end.
Grants for the third tier required that practices enroll as new Medicaid providers in Rhode Island by Sept. 1. Tier three grants have not yet been announced and will be approved on a rolling basis, because the state needs time to verify a provider’s enrollment. The state has allotted a maximum of $100,000 for grants in this tier.   
McKee said in a statement that the grants are “central” to his administration’s goal of “building a healthier state for all” by 2030, alongside efforts to accelerate a review of the Medicaid rates paid to providers, require insurers to spend more on primary care reimbursement, ease prior authorization rules, and expand student loan forgiveness for primary care doctors.
The grants arrived the same week the General Assembly passed the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget, which begins July 1. The budget also includes a strong emphasis on primary care by allocating $45 million toward providers, with $26 million of that infusion meant to raise Medicaid reimbursement rates by Oct. 1.
Low reimbursement rates for primary care doctors and an aging workforce of physicians have been cited as major contributors to the state’s primary care crisis. The closure of Anchor Medical Associates’ three offices — announced in April and to be finalized by June 30 — was another blow to general practitioners, leaving about 25,000 patients without a primary doctor.

The fledgling policy was being considered by the Cromaine District Library in Hartland, located in Livingston County near Howell, which raised eyebrows and tensions because many of the books being challenged in the library contain LGBTQ+ characters or themes.
Attorneys and advocates who voiced opposition to the policy said the sequestration of challenged books based almost exclusively on the anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs of some board or community members was discriminatory and a book ban in all but name.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Much like the battles over prohibiting library books or criminalizing them for minors that have played out over the last few years, activists and attorneys across Michigan have said that similarly sequestering or restricting access to books runs afoul of the First Amendment.
The board discussed the policy in June at a special meeting that saw some community members removed from the library and ended with a visit from the Livingston County Sheriff’s Department to make sure the meeting remained orderly.

Members of the Cromaine District Library Board of Trustees on Thursday, June 19, backed off from the sequestration policy being discussed by the board since January. The board instead voted to adopt a policy that would simply label books found to contain extreme violence or graphic sexual content.
Sarah Neidart, director of the Cromaine District Library, told Michigan Advance that the policy allows for non-prejudicial, viewpoint-neutral labels, specifically crafted to notify patterns “that materials may contain graphic violence or sexually explicit material as defined ‘by law.’”
“This was the conclusion of an effort by the board to work together to craft a policy that retains the right of local parents or guardians to restrict what their children read, rather than rely on staff to censor what a child may access in the library,” Neidart said in a statement.
The amendment to the policy can be found in Article 9, Section E.
“If the director determines the material may contain graphic violence or sexually explicit material (as defined in the Appendixes), the material may be: relocated within the collection, and/or labeled with, ‘this book may contain graphic violence or sexually explicit material – Cromaine District Library,’” the amended policy reads.
Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan told the Cromaine Library Board of Trustees that it was monitoring the situation and urged members against sequestration of challenged books or using labels to deter patrons from reading or seeing LGBTQ+ materials.
In response to the new policy adopted late last week, Jay Kaplan, a long-time staff attorney with the ACLU of Michigan specializing in LGBTQ+ rights, told the Advance that it was important to understand how the library would define graphic violence and sexually explicit material.
“It’s probably legal and constitutional for a library board to have that authority, but we just want to make sure that it’s not misused,” Kaplan said. “Certainly, there’s been some comments by members of that library board that would seem to indicate that one might be concerned that it would be misused.”
Kaplan said the ACLU of Michigan and other groups would be watching closely to see how the labeling process unfolds.
“There’s been a number of books that … one person has complained about and those books feature LGBTQ+ characters and content,” Kaplan said. “Hopefully, this new policy won’t be used as a way to label books – not because they are graphically violent or sexually explicit – but because they contain [LGBTQ+] subject matter.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603_190559-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 15:24:09.705318

The new members include:

Gus Olympidis, of Valparaiso, who owns Family Express Convenience Stores.
John Gregg, of Sandborn, a former Democratic House Speaker of the Indiana General Assembly and attorney.

Gregg ran for governor in 2012 against former Gov. and Vice President Mike Pence. He, again, ran in 2016 against eventual winner former Gov. Eric Holcomb.

Braun concluded the release by thanking the previous board members, saying their terms ended with the new appointments.
A new IEDC
With Commerce Secretary David Adams, Braun has vowed to reform the quasi-public state agency to increase transparency, especially in the wake of a forensic investigation. Changing the administration of the IEDC was a major topic on the campaign trail, which featured a former commerce secretary who oversaw the Lebanon LEAP project.

Linde, an industrial chemical manufacturer, announced Monday it will build an air separation unit to supply oxygen and nitrogen for the production of low-carbon ammonia at a plant next door, according to a news release from Louisiana Economic Development (LED). Its customer is the Blue Point Number One complex, a joint-venture owned by CF Industries, JERA and Mitsui & Co. That $4 billion project is under development at the RiverPlex MegaPark.
Linde’s new project is expected to create 15 direct new jobs with an average annual salary more than 45% above the parish average wage, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates is $1,442 per week. 
“This announcement is yet another win for the West Bank as we build out the industrial base and bring high-wage job opportunities to the area,” LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois said. “For more than half a century, Linde has helped make Louisiana a global energy leader. Their latest investment reflects our shared commitment to optimizing our legacy sectors while driving our entire business ecosystem toward growth, innovation and global impact.”
Linde currently operates facilities in Geismar, St. Charles Parish, Vidalia, Lake Charles and Sulphur, as well as an extensive pipeline network across south Louisiana.
The company is expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programs, incentives that will provide Linde with breaks on local property and state payroll taxes, respectively.

The passenger terminal at Wilmington Airport will be renamed the Thomas R. Carper Passenger Terminal Facility later this year, following a recent vote by the Delaware River & Bay Authority (DRBA) commissioners to honor the retired U.S. senator.
Approved through Resolution 25-28, the designation recognizes Carper’s more than five decades of public service in Delaware and his long-standing support of the DRBA and its infrastructure initiatives.
“On behalf of the DRBA, we’d like to recognize Sen. Carper for his steadfast advocacy and support of our organization throughout his career,” said Thomas J. Cook, executive director. 
“Upon the news of his retirement, it made perfect sense to acknowledge Sen. Carper, a distinguished member of the Delaware Aviation Hall of Fame, by naming our renovated and expanded terminal facility in his honor,” he said. “From championing the DRBA’s 1995 acquisition of ILG, to relentlessly vying for grants to enhance infrastructure improvements and promote economic growth, Sen. Carper will forever be fondly remembered here at the DRBA.”
RELATED STORY: Expanded Wilmington Airport among DRBA’s $132.7M capital plan
Ben Clendaniel, AAE, director of airport operations, highlighted Carper’s role in strengthening Delaware’s only commercial airport.
Sen. Thomas Richard Carper served from 2001- 2025 as a US senator for Delaware.
“Sen. Carper’s love of flight and commitment to supporting aviation in Delaware was crucial in keeping Wilmington Airport competitive,” Clendaniel said. “As [it is] Delaware’s only commercial service airport, he recognized the airport’s importance of putting Delaware on the map by enhancing access to air travel for Delawareans and attracting new economic opportunities including aviation jobs to our region. Because of his dedication, we’ve been able to continually strengthen our ability to improve the customer experience and expand connectivity in our community.”
Carper, a former U.S. Navy flight officer who served three tours during the Vietnam War, began his civilian public service as Delaware’s state treasurer in 1977. He later represented Delaware in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 1992, served two terms as governor from 1993 to 2000, and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2001. He retired from public office in January 2025.
RELATED STORY: 3 Del. airports split $9 million for expansion, renovations
Over the years, Carper played a central role in securing major funding for infrastructure projects tied to DRBA operations. In 2024, he helped obtain a $5.6 million grant through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Airport Terminal Program, which is supporting the ongoing $9.8 million expansion of the Wilmington Airport terminal. That project is expected to be completed this fall.

The lawmakers cite a Markup and CalMatters investigation that first revealed Covered California’s data practices in April.


Citing an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, lawmakers in the House of Representatives are questioning why California’s state health insurance exchange shared sensitive health data with LinkedIn.
In a letter sent last week to Jessica Altman, executive director of the state’s exchange, the lawmakers write they are “deeply concerned about the privacy and security implications” raised by a Markup and CalMatters story published in April.
The story showed through forensic testing how the exchange, Covered California, used trackers that told LinkedIn when visitors entered health information like whether they were blind, pregnant, or used a high number of prescription medications into the website coveredca.com. 
The trackers, which operated for more than a year as part of a marketing campaign before being removed, also logged information like whether visitors were transgender or possible victims of domestic violence.
Kentucky Congressman Brett Guthrite, who chairs the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, sent the letter alongside four other Republican lawmakers. “The Committee seeks to understand how such sensitive data could have been transmitted through advertising trackers, what oversight existed to detect or prevent it, and whether Covered California took appropriate steps to protect consumer information,” the lawmakers wrote.

The other signatories are Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter of Georgia, who chairs Energy and Commerce’s health subcommittee; Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama, who chairs the oversight and investigations subcommittee; Rep. Gus M. Bilirakis of Florida and California Rep. Jay Obernolte. 
The letter said “the extended period of data exposure raises serious questions about the adequacy of safeguards that Covered California had in place.” Those “circumstances warrant examination of Covered California’s actions under federal privacy standards,” including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the letter continued. 
As part of the Affordable Care Act, states must offer health insurance through exchanges that allow residents to shop for and purchase health care plans. States can either let the federal government operate those exchanges or maintain their own, as California and 18 other states do. 
In California, millions of people rely on the exchange to find their coverage. But unbeknownst to those signing up for care, the exchange’s website used a tool called the “LinkedIn Insight Tag” that sent answers to potentially sensitive questions to the tech company. The tag is widely used for advertising purposes but LinkedIn explicitly prohibits using it to share health data.
In response to The Markup and CalMatters’ reporting, Covered California said the exchange had inadvertently shared the data and that it had instituted a review of practices. As the review happens, the organization said that it has paused its use of trackers entirely. 
The investigation immediately triggered an outcry. One House lawmaker asked in a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services whether the practice may have violated HIPAA. A proposed class-action lawsuit against LinkedIn and Google alleging privacy violations was also filed one day after the story was published.
Since then, a followup investigation by The Markup and CalMatters found four other state exchanges also sharing information with tech companies. The stories were produced as part of a series called Pixel Hunt, examining the unexpected ways websites share data.
A spokesperson for Covered California said they had received the letter and planned to respond by the committee’s deadline of July 1st. A spokesperson for LinkedIn declined to comment.
The lawmakers asked Covered California to provide answers and documents in response to several questions about the organization’s data privacy practices, as well as its use of web trackers generally. The questions included what data was sent to LinkedIn, how many people were affected, and how or whether those affected will be notified.
“Ensuring the confidentiality of health information is a foundational obligation for entities operating within the health insurance ecosystem,” the lawmakers wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/042924_Covered-CA_AH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-23 15:24:09.705318

(Photo Courtesy of UW-Madison)Wisconsin Public Radio announced last week that it was laying off at least 15 staff members and cancelling four radio programs as the station faces budget shortages and the looming prospect of cuts to its federal funding. 
The staff members were notified of the layoffs on Friday and the cancelled programs include the nationally syndicated “To the Best of Our Knowledge,” the arts and culture show “BETA,” the health show “Zorba Paster On Your Health” and the local “University of the Air.” 
Republicans in control of the U.S. Congress have been considering a proposal to rescind federal money previously allocated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes federal funds to local stations across the country. Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to take $1.1 billion from CPB and the Senate has until mid-July to pass its own version of the provision. 
About four percent of WPR’s budget comes from federal CPB funds. 
But WPR’s financial troubles were looming prior to the Republican cuts, with the station facing a budget deficit in recent years. WPR itself reported that the prospect of layoffs was raised almost a year ago and there is a plan to merge WPR with the more financially stable PBS Wisconsin in the works. 
“We’re saddened to say goodbye to these valued colleagues and shows that have been an important part of our recent history,” Sarah Ashworth, WPR director, said in a letter announcing the changes. “This is a difficult decision and WPR must prioritize its capacity to provide what no other media outlet can: unique Wisconsin content from a decidedly Wisconsin point of view. A focus on creating Wisconsin content for Wisconsin audiences is our obligation to — and our richest opportunity for — public service.”

(Stock photo by SeventyFour/Getty Images)Federal, state, and local officials say 60 children ranging in age from 9-17 have been recovered in what an official called the “the largest in the history of the United States Marshal Service.”
During a Monday morning news conference in Tampa, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier was joined by state, local, and federal law enforcement officials to announce the results of the operation that spanned two weeks. 
“Operation Dragon Eye” involved 20 agencies and more than 100 people, recovering 60 missing children in “critical danger.”
“This is what it’s all about. This is why we do the job,” Uthmeier said. 
According to Uthmeier’s office, the eight people arrested face various charges, including human trafficking, child endangerment, drug possession, and drug trafficking.
“Many of these kids have been through painful disastrous situations but, at least today, we’ve rescued them and we now can work towards recovery,” Uthmeier said.
Bill Berger, U.S. Marshal for the Central District of Florida, called the operation “the largest in the history of the United States Marshal Service, if not the history of the United States.”
The bonds range from no bond to $250 million, Berger said. “I’ve never heard of that before,” Berger said. 
The children were reported missing in Hillsborough, Pinellas, and Pasco counties.
Callahan Walsh, director of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and co-host of America’s Most Wanted on Fox, encouraged the attorney general to continue prosecuting missing children crimes. 
“This is more than a number. It represents dozens of lives brought out of harm’s way, and a powerful testament to what can be accomplished through communication, collaboration, and data sharing,” Walsh said. 
Katherine Gomez, director of human trafficking intervention at the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice, said more than half of the 60 children rescued have had previous involvement with the juvenile justice system. 
“Every kid recovered by this operation is an opportunity. It’s a it’s a chance, it’s a touch point, it’s a connection for that young person and the larger community,” Gomez said. “And maybe today will be the day that that young person decides to make major changes in their life. Maybe today is not that day, but today at least that day of recovery.”
Natasha Nascimento, founder of Redefining Refuge, a nonprofit serving youth victims of commercial sexual exploitation, said several children recovered were pregnant. 
“This U.S. led Marshal operation didn’t just recover children, it recovered generations,” Nascimento said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah Gov. Spencer Cox issued an executive order on Monday that directs the referendum aimed at overturning HB267 to be placed on the 2026 general election ballot, the latest update in months of controversy over lawmakers’ attempts to strip public unions of their ability to collectively bargain. 
Cox’s order comes after an announcement from Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s office over the weekend confirming that a coalition of labor groups gathered enough signatures to qualify for a referendum, which is when voters choose to enact or repeal legislation during an election.

HB267 was already on hold after Henderson’s office announced in May that county clerks around the state had processed and certified enough signatures. On Saturday, Henderson signed a letter officially declaring the requirements to qualify for a referendum had been met. 
One of the most controversial bills passed during the 2025 legislative session, HB267 prevents public unions from collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate a contract or terms of employment. That means a teachers union would no longer be allowed to negotiate an employment contract with a school district. The same goes for firefighters, police officers, municipal workers and other public employees.
Lawmakers said the bill would protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members. If a teachers union only represents one third of the employees in a school district, it shouldn’t be able to negotiate employment contracts on behalf of everyone, said the bill sponsors, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy.
But the bill outraged the state’s unions, both public and private, arguing it made workplaces less safe and stripped public employees of their right to advocate. That opposition morphed into the Protect Utah Workers coalition, which consisted of groups like the Utah Education Association, the Professional Firefighters of Utah and the Utah Fraternal Order of Police. 
Labor coalition shatters threshold to qualify for referendum in effort to repeal union bill

After the legislative session ended in March, the coalition began collecting signatures for a referendum. 
Qualifying for a ballot referendum in Utah requires gathering signatures from at least 8% of the active voters in the state, meaning about 141,000 people. That 8% threshold must also be met in at least 15 of the state’s 29 Senate districts. 
Those signatures must be gathered in 30 days, making Utah’s requirements some of the most stringent of any state that allows referendums.
On April 16, the coalition announced it had submitted 320,000 signatures to county clerks across the state, which they say is the most signatures ever gathered for a referendum in Utah. By April 28, data showed that the coalition would likely qualify to put a referendum on the ballot. 
According to data from the lieutenant governor’s office, 251,274 signatures have been confirmed as of May 9. The 8% threshold was also met in 23 of 29 Senate districts. 
Per Utah code, if enough signatures are confirmed, the referendum is then put on the ballot for the general election — but since it’s an off year, Cox had the choice to either declare a special election, or direct the referendum to be put on hold until the next general election. 
Cox chose the latter, meaning voters will decide during statewide midterm elections on Nov. 3, 2026. 
The Utah Education Association, a statewide teachers union, called the step a major victory for public workers. 
“You stood in the rain, snow and heat. You gave up weekends, evenings and even spring break to gather signatures and educate voters,” said the association’s president, Renée Pinkney. “You showed up for your students, your colleagues and your communities, and you made history.”

Nippon Steel completed its purchase of U.S. Steel last week, placing two Iron Range mines under new ownership with some oversight from the federal government under a national security pact.
The deal includes a “golden share” that gives President Donald Trump and future administrations an ability to block certain actions and some leverage to enforce promises made by the Japanese steelmaker.
In practice, the arrangement is a permanent single share of preferred stock in U.S. Steel that allows the president or a designee to effectively serve on the company’s board.
As part of the pact, a number of potential activities by the company are disallowed without approval of the president, ranging from moving its headquarters to following through on investments.
For the Iron Range, the deal intends to send about $800 million in investments to U.S. Steel mines between 2025 and 2028 as part of a larger promise to spend $11 billion domestically. That total also calls for construction of a new $1 billion mini mill at an undetermined location.
Nippon is set to spend $200 million in 2025 and 2026, and $300 million in 2027 and 2028 at the company’s Minntac and Keetac facilities, subject to approvals and permits, according to SEC filings.
No details have been provided on the scope of those local investments, and a spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber told Iron Range Today recently that particulars were still unknown.
The United Steelworkers (USW) have been the biggest opponent of the merger since it was announced in December 2023, and supported U.S. Steel rival Cleveland-Cliffs to acquire the company.
Union officials were miffed that the company didn’t consult with them before agreeing to the Nippon Steel sale, and have sought written assurances from the new parent company that would protect contracts, jobs and retiree benefits.
Nippon has said it would honor current collective bargaining agreements with USW, which are set to expire next year, but little-to-no language concerning workers and jobs was present in the national security pact publicized Wednesday.
The deal calls for the company to maintain base salaries of current employees until 2030, and is meant to safeguard against plant closures, idles or sales up to June 18, 2035, including at Minntac and Keetac.
But it also carved out an exception for temporary plant idles, which typically include layoffs and a more open-ended timeline than the term implies.
That’s the current case at two Cliffs facilities on the Iron Range. The company announced temporary idles in March, impacting 630 miners at Hibbing Taconite and Minorca Mine.
Company officials anticipated a six-month down period, but union leaders have expressed concern over the winterizing process at Minorca — calling it instead an “indefinite idle” period, and whether the full workforce at HibTac will ever return.
USW President Dave McCall said Wednesday that union would work to hold Nippon responsible to its promises.
“Our current agreement expires in September 2026,” he said, “and rest assured, if our job security, pensions, retiree health care or other hard-earned benefits are threatened, we are ready to respond with the full strength and solidarity of our membership.”
More broadly, the Keetac and Minntac facilities would stand to benefit from a cash infusion.
Keetac recently finalized upgrades to produce of DR-grade pellets to feed electric-arc furnaces, and was reportedly a facility of interest for Nippon from the start. It also faces a large unknown with its water permits and state sulfate standards, which could present a significant cost hurdle.
Minntac also has permit renewals on the horizon, as well as general maintenance at the largest taconite mine in the United States.
Nippon will also have to navigate a 25% ownership stake in Minntac by Cliffs, stemming from a pandemic-era decision by U.S. Steel to sell part of the mine to Stelco in 2020. Terms of the deal appear to allow the company a clean out in 2027, but at a cost of $120 million. Stelco was purchased by Cliffs last year.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iron-ore-us-steel-1024x693.webp,,,2025-06-23 14:10:45.545230

Gov. JB Pritzker signed a new law Friday to make a series of changes to the Prisoner Review Board after it released a man who would go on to commit murder, leading to intense scrutiny in Springfield.

Pritzker signed Senate Bill 19, which contains changes designed to include victims’ participation in Prisoner Review Board decisions and ensure more board members have relevant law enforcement or judicial experience.

The law gives victims the right to file impact statements ahead of hearings, provides them with additional notice when their offender is granted early release, and allows them to seek an order of protection against an offender who is incarcerated.

It also creates the Office of the Director of Victim and Witness Services within the PRB, which would ensure the board complies with victims’ rights. The measure also mandates the board provide victims with contact information for the State Victim Assistance Hotline.

“The bulk of this bill is focused on … making sure that victims, survivors, are more engaged in the process at PRB because unfortunately, too often, we’ve heard from victims and family members that they simply haven’t been given a voice in this process,” bill sponsor Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago, said when the bill passed the House last month.

The bill was approved by the Senate in April on a 33-22 vote, with some Democrats opposing it. The House voted 74-37 along party lines to send the bill to Pritzker’s desk in May. Republicans, who had for months been calling for broader reforms, criticized the bill.

Pritzker’s signature comes just two weeks after a man released by the PRB was found guilty of murdering 11-year-old Jayden Perkins at his Chicago home in March 2024.

Crosetti Brand was released from prison in 2023 after serving a sentence for a domestic violence conviction. After his release, Brand began threatening a former partner, Laterria Smith, and showed up to her home in February 2024, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Brand was sent back to prison for violating the conditions of his release, and Smith filed for an order of protection. But a Cook County judge denied the order because Brand was behind bars.

On March 12, 2024, the PRB voted to release Brand citing a lack of evidence to keep him behind bars, the Sun-Times reported. The next day, Brand confronted Smith at her home and stabbed her and her son, Perkins, multiple times. Smith survived but Perkins did not. Brand was found guilty of first-degree murder and 16 other counts earlier this month.

Two board members, including the chair, resigned after Perkins’ death. Smith sued the board for negligence in March.

The case put even more scrutiny on the board, which was already in the spotlight over other controversial decisions to release people from prison.

In May 2024, the Senate unanimously passed a bill that would have made a series of reforms to the board, including requiring that certain meetings be livestreamed and board members receive additional training. The bill appeared ready to pass the House with 76 members signing on as cosponsors. But the bill was never called for a vote in the final hours of session after Pritzker had concerns about the feasibility of the livestreaming requirements and lack of funding for the board.

Instead, lawmakers moved forward with the legislation signed by Pritzker on Friday, which Republicans opposed saying it doesn’t go far enough to meaningfully reform the board.

“After the Governor ignored our consistent and clear warnings, a horrible murder was triggered by a terrible decision by the Prisoner Review Board,” Sens. Jason Plummer, R-Edwardsville, and Steve McClure, R-Springfield, said in a statement. “Now, instead of listening to a bipartisan coalition at the capitol, he and his far-left allies pushed through a bill that makes it more difficult for the PRB to keep violent criminals off the streets.”

The new law also attempts to make the board more professional, Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, the Senate sponsor of the bill, said in April. It gives board members eight-year terms instead of six so they can be more focused on their decisions rather than their reappointment, he said. It also changes qualifications for board members, requiring seven out of the 15 board members have at least five years of experience as a law enforcement officer, parole officer, prosecutor, criminal defense attorney or judge.

Republicans opposed creating longer terms for board members, saying it reduces Senate oversight of the board and fails to hold board members accountable for decisions. The Senate is responsible for confirming the governor’s appointments to the board.

HUNTSVILLE — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.

Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.

Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.

‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.

Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”

Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

Michigan’s U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) announced Monday that she plans to introduce the “Stop Trump’s Abuse of Power Act” within the next week. Stevens’ bill would make it illegal for Trump, or any other president in the future, to deploy active duty military forces to a state or a territory without a request from that state’s governor or that territory’s executive leadership.
Trump deployed U.S. Marines to the streets of Los Angeles this month in response to community uprisings and protests against federal ICE raids targeting immigrants in California. He also moved to control the California National Guard, which was at first blocked by a federal district court, but was allowed later by a federal appellate court panel.

Stevens said the Trump administration’s actions would only increase tensions between law enforcement and protesters.
“President Trump has shown a disturbing pattern of disregard for the Constitution and due process. This month, he made it harder for local law enforcement to do their jobs in California by unlawfully deploying our military on U.S. soil – further escalating tension and violence,” Stevens said in a statement. “We must stand up to Donald Trump’s chaos and destruction, which is why I am introducing this legislation to limit his powers and make sure he cannot deploy troops on U.S. soil for his political gain. We are a nation of laws and it’s about time the president begins to follow them.”
A news release noted that Stevens’ bill would add the language prohibiting unauthorized military deployments to rein in citizen uprisings to the Insurrection Act of 1807 and would only apply to peaceful protests and demonstrations.

“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
Congressional chaos
The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
Future possibilities
Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A government watchdog says it’s unclear when — or even whether — we’ll know going forward how the end of national abortion protections impact Americans’ health outcomes, livelihoods and financial futures as the federal government turns away from abortion data collection indefinitely.
A report released Monday by the Government Accountability Office and first shared exclusively with The 19th analyzed the existing data on the economic impact of abortion bans and found that government tracking has been very limited — and could become more so due to changes made by the Trump administration.
The last federal data on the impact of abortion bans ends in 2022, when Roe v. Wade was overturned. That data is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been collecting data on the number of abortions and the demographics of those who obtain them in its Abortion Surveillance report for almost six decades. Since publishing the 2022 data in November (data is typically released on a two-year delay), it’s unclear whether the agency plans to continue the research. Though the CDC’s survey is voluntary and limited in scope — some states, including California, for example, don’t provide information — the report was one of the most reliable sources of government abortion data.
Without it, there is no detailed federal data on what has happened since Roe was overturned. Tuesday marks three years since the landmark Supreme Court case was reversed in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision.
“According to Department of Health and Human Services officials we spoke to in May 2025, the agency, which includes CDC, is undergoing a realignment,” the nonpartisan GAO, which provides independent research for Congress and executive agencies, wrote in its report. “Officials were uncertain whether the resulting changes at the agency would affect future data collection efforts, including data on abortions.”
For its analysis, GAO contacted seven federal agencies to ask what efforts they were undertaking to assess the economic effects of state abortion restrictions. Only the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Chief Actuary said it planned to consider the economic impact of abortion restrictions in some of its upcoming work. The agency uses CDC data to make predictions about birth rates and whether any impact from abortion bans could affect the broader economy and the size of the labor force.
But the agency told GAO it will require three years of abortion data since Roe v. Wade was overturned to be able to come to any conclusion and, even then, the data over that period is so limited it may be too insufficient to be reliable.
All of it hinges on whether the CDC continues to collect state abortion data at all. The CDC did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Already, the Trump administration has moved to eliminate research on abortion. In January, Trump issued an executive order blocking data collection measuring the effect of access to reproductive care, including abortion care. The administration scrubbed several references to abortion on the Department of Health and Human Services’ website.
That data could potentially illuminate for lawmakers the myriad effects abortion restrictions can have. Beyond the health consequences, lack of abortion access can destabilize people economically, affecting everything from where they choose to live to whether they can stay employed.
“Not only does the new report show impacts of these harmful bans in stark terms, it also raises red flags about the government’s ability to collect important economic data due to the Trump Administration’s attacks on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies,” said Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia, in a statement to The 19th. The investigation into the data was requested by Scott and Sen. Richard Blumental, a New York Democrat.
For its report released Monday, GAO had to instead turn to 55 rigorously researched studies conducted over the past seven years, including from the Guttmacher Institute and research published in peer-reviewed medical journals such as JAMA and the American Journal of Public Health. GAO also spoke with four academic researchers and three national organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
Blumental called the report “irrefutable” evidence of the impact the Dobbs ruling has on the financial stability of women.
“There’s a proven connection between slashed reproductive freedoms and devastating financial distress. Unsafe and unintended pregnancies have huge costs — in lives and dollars — impacting all of us,” Blumental said in a statement to The 19th. “This fact-based document is a searing indictment of Dobbs on its third anniversary.”
According to the research, getting an abortion has become more expensive since some states banned the procedure, requiring patients to often take time off work to travel to a state with abortion access, plus the cost of that travel, the care itself and any child care expenses. It amounts to a “significant expense for low-income families,” GAO found.
One 2021 study out of Tennessee showed that even the introduction of a mandatory, 48-hour waiting period in 2015 that required two visits to get an abortion caused the average cost to rise by several hundred dollars.
Abortion access also impacts other decisions people make around where to live and whether they get an education. One 2023 study that GAO highlighted found that working women with at least a bachelor’s degree were more than 7 percent more likely to move to a state without restrictions than one with it. Another post-Roe study found that Black women living in states with abortion restrictions as teenagers were less likely than Black women in other states to enter college and complete it.
People who are unable to get an abortion then face worse financial outcomes in the months and years that follow. GAO cites findings from the Turnaway Study, a massive abortion research project that followed 1,000 women over 10 years studying the ways that being denied an abortion reshaped their lives.
Historically, about half of people who seek abortions live in poverty, and economic stability is one of the top reasons they seek an abortion in the first place. Many cite concerns around caring for the children they already have.
The United States’ lacks a strong social safety net for parents — those on food assistance programs can’t use the funds they receive to buy diapers, for instance; mothers on the federal assistance program for low-income women and children are deeply restricted in what formula they can buy with government assistance; and child care across the country is now costlier than in-state tuition in 41 states. For a single parent, child care costs swallow a third of their income on average (and in some states as much as half).
The Turnaway Study found that women who were denied care fell deeper into poverty and took four years to catch up to the employment levels of the women in the study who did receive an abortion. GAO’s analysis of the existing data also found that women who were denied care were less likely to be working full-time six months after the denial.
Diana Greene Foster, the author of the Turnaway Study and a MacArthur “genius grant” recipient, was hoping to continue her work by following people who sought abortions after the overturn of Roe.
But Foster was only six months into a five-year federal grant to fund the study when federal funding was terminated in March.
In a letter from the National Institutes of Health that Foster shared with The 19th at the time, she was told her research no longer aligned with agency priorities: “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/OLIVEAUPHOTO-2048x1662-1-1024x831.jpg,,,2025-06-23 13:11:44.822008

Gun violence is now, quite shamefully, the leading cause of death for children and youth in our country.

The state Department of Health maintains a map of cooling centers open to the public — although there are caveats to keep in mind before you head to one. 
The National Weather Service has issued an extreme heat warning for parts of Franklin, Grand Isle, Chittenden and Addison counties through Tuesday at 8 p.m., and a heat advisory for the rest of the state. Burlington is forecast to hit 97 degrees Monday and 96 degrees Tuesday, with cooler temperatures expected for the rest of the week.
The health department lists more than 400 potential places for Vermonters to go inside for air conditioning or access water to help stay cool. Some locations are only occasional cooling facilities, so the department recommends calling ahead to check if they’re open to the public. Others might only be open during the daytime or only on certain days of the week. You can also call 211 to help find an open cooling location near you.

Other locations are recreation sites with bodies of water but charge an entry fee, like a pool or a state park. Housing advocates have said in previous years that it can be difficult for unhoused Vermonters to access these locations. 
Older adults, young children and people with chronic health conditions are more at risk of heat-related illnesses, according to the health department. It recommends Vermonters stay hydrated, avoid exertion and wear light, loose-fitting clothing if they go outside. 
If your home is not air conditioned, keeping the shades drawn, taking cool showers and using a fan can be helpful to keep the temperature down inside, the department said. It has more information on avoiding heat-related injuries on its website.

The bill’s lead sponsors include U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, both Oregon Democrats, and U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo, both Idaho Republicans.
“This is a significant, encouraging and urgently needed step for Oregonians living and working in counties that have depended for decades on these federal investments for local schools, roads, law enforcement and more,” Wyden said in a press release. Wyden co-authored the initial bipartisan legislation in 2000.
The sponsors introduced the legislation in 2024, where it unanimously passed the Senate but did not receive a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives before the end of the congressional session.
This year, bill sponsors are urging the U.S. House to reauthorize the program. Without its passage in the House, rural counties in Oregon, Idaho and across the country will fall short of funds that support local services.
“Idaho counties rely on (Secure Rural Schools) funding for schools, road maintenance, and other essential services,” Risch said in the release. “Until we can bring historic timber revenue back to these areas, this program must be reauthorized. The federal government made a promise to rural communities, and I’m proud to see the Senate follow through.”

“A new report from the state Department of Public Instruction confirms what school voucher opponents have been saying: universal voucher programs are a wasteful giveaway to disproportionately wealthy families who have already enrolled their children in private schools.” That’s the opening sentence from a recent essay authored by North Carolina Justice Center senior policy analyst, Kris Nordstrom.
And when one digs deeper into the data Nordstrom analyzed, it’s clear that his assessment is on the mark. The numbers reveal that, in the current school year, only a tiny percentage of vouchers went to students who attended public school in the previous year – a fact that makes clear the voucher program disproportionately benefits wealthy families who had already enrolled their children in private schools. And recently, Newsline’s Rob Schofield sat down with Nordstrom to learn more about this finding and the destructive impact vouchers are having on public education.

A hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 17, 2025.
Tegtmeyer has faced disciplinary charges from the board on at least three prior occasions. In 2005, Tegtmeyer, then known as Diane Teske, was charged by the board with falsifying records related to and committing some sort of an act that might have adversely affected a patient’s welfare.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board alleged Tegtmeyer had been working at a long-term care facility from December 2004 until she was fired in October 2005 for allegedly charting that she had given medication to more than one resident but instead “put the medication in the garbage.” The board ordered Tegtmeyer to complete 30 hours of training on ethics.
In 2007, the board charged Tegtmeyer with practicing nursing without an active license and being convicted of crime related to the practice of nursing. The board alleged Tegtmeyer was fired by her employer, unnamed by the board, for taking the credit card of an associate and using it to make purchases at Walmart. She later pled guilty to a charge of credit card forgery, according to board records. The board fined Tegtmeyer $50 and ordered her to complete another 30 hours of training in ethics.
In 2012, Tegtmeyer was convicted of the criminal charge of tampering with records and later began working at Heritage Care Center in Iowa Falls.
In 2015, the Board of Nursing alleged Tegtmeyer failed to report the tampering-with-records conviction to the board and charged Tegtmeyer with knowingly making misleading or untrue representations in the practice of the profession, and knowingly made misleading or untrue representations related to her credentials or licensure status.
The board also alleged she falsified records related to her submission of a family member’s urine sample, which she sent to a lab for testing. In resolving the case, the board fined Tegtmeyer $500 and ordered her to complete an additional 30 hours of training on ethics.
Other nursing board actions
Other Iowa nurses facing sanctions from the board include:
— Ann Schwartz of Marion, a registered nurse who worked at an unspecified behavioral health hospital in the Des Moines area and allegedly knowingly made misleading or untrue representations in the practice of the profession, knowingly made misleading or untrue representations that may have involved falsified records, and failed to assess or report the status of a patient. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for June 30, 2025.
— Lorraine Anderson of Salix, a registered nurse who is charged by the board with falsification of records related to nursing and failing to assess or report the status of a patient. The available public documents give no indication as to when or where the alleged violations took place or whether a patient was harmed. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for June 24, 2025.
— Lauren Haldin of Ankeny, a registered nurse who is charged with misappropriating medications or supplies of a patient or agency, failing to safeguard or secure medications as required by law, and failing to assess or report the status of a patient.  The alleged violations took place at some unspecified time in the past while Haldin worked at a behavioral health hospital in the Des Moines area. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 16, 2025.
— Adella Boeding of Donnellson, a registered nurse who is charged with falsifying records related to nursing and performing nursing services beyond her authorized scope of practice. The available public documents give no indication as to when or where the alleged violations took place or whether a patient was harmed. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 18, 2025.
— Shana Moss of Danbury, a registered nurse who was charged by the board with misappropriating medications or supplies of a patient or agency. The board alleged that Moss was working at an unspecified nursing facility in September 2024 when she was suspected of stealing Ozempic from a resident. Cameras at the facility allegedly showed that about 9:25 p.m., on Sept. 8, 2024, Moss walked into the home’s medicine room and took the Ozempic out of the box, placed it in her pocket and kept it. The medication was not scheduled to be given to the patient at that time, the board alleged. To resolve the case, the board issued Moss a warning and ordered her to complete 30 hours of training in ethics.
— Amanda Hake of Davenport, an Iowa-licensed nurse who in 2022 pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of controlled substances — oxycodone and clonazepam — without a prescription. In response to that, in April 2024 the board suspended Hake’s license pending a substance abuse evaluation and enrollment in a chemical screening program.
In August 2024, she was pulled over by police and cited for an open container of alcohol in her car. In October 2024, she was charged with theft for allegedly operating a vehicle that had been reported as stolen. Around that time, the board alleges, she failed to make daily contact with the chemical screening program as required and also failed to submit to testing on multiple occasions.
In January 2025, the board issued an emergency order suspending Hake’s license. The board alleges that during a subsequent board hearing on the matter, Hake initially claimed she had not worked as a nurse in the fall of 2024 but later admitted she had done so, working up to four 12-hour shifts at an unspecified medical facility.
On April 25, 2025, the board revoked Hake’s license.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)As the summer heat moves in, thermostats are turning down. Cooling our homes is a natural reaction that we don’t tend to think much about –– until the electric bill shows up.
June not only kicked off summer, but with it came new electric rates for all utility customers as prices jumped on the heels of the PJM capacity auction price increase. This prompted the Public Utility Commission (PUC) to issue a press release advising energy users of tips to shop for their electricity.
Why? Because that’s where customers can find savings.
Aside from adjusting your thermostat to conserve electricity, the only control Pennsylvania consumers have over their electric bill is their electric supply –– the product that actually powers their home. What most people don’t realize is they have options to shop for different suppliers, just like they shop for other products and services. And the savings can be significant. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In the early 1990s, when I was commissioner with the PUC, Pennsylvania was dealing with rolling blackouts and high electric rates. The Commission knew action had to be taken to improve the energy market for consumers. 
In 1996, after working with the legislature, the Electricity Generation Competition and Customer Choice Act was signed into law by Governor Tom Ridge. This solution broke up the utility monopolies in the state and welcomed competition to generate and supply electricity. This freed customers to choose the products they wanted and for the prices that worked best with their budget. It also meant all suppliers had to compete for business –– including utility companies. 
After nearly 30 years of energy competition, it was time to analyze electricity prices to see if competition is still working. What I found is pretty eye-opening and should serve as a positive reminder that Pennsylvania leaders took –– and have preserved –– the best course of action to protect energy customers. 
Here’s what I uncovered.
In three utility service territories, customers could have been paying less for their electricity supply in 2024 than what they paid in 1996, if they shopped for the lowest fixed-rate offer in those areas. This means the customers in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia areas could have, respectively, paid $9 and $14 less a month in 2024 compared to what they paid in 1996. 
That’s without even adjusting for inflation.
When inflation is factored in, statewide, customers who shopped for their electricity in 2024 were paying, on average, 26 percent to 67 percent less than they would have in 1996 for supply charges. In the Duquesne Light territory, that’s a $53 difference –– a $56 difference in the PECO territory. 
Moreover, actual utility supply rates in 2024, paid by customers who do not shop, are less than what the 1996 inflation-adjusted rates are.

All Pennsylvania electricity customers are benefiting from energy competition, whether they shop or not. And the benefits expand beyond price. 
Customers today have access to products and plans that have been driven by competition working to deliver new innovations in order to earn the business of customers. More importantly, Pennsylvania hasn’t seen a rolling blackout due to inadequate generation or supply since 1994 –– two years before the competition legislation was signed into law.
As consumers, we shop around for just about everything. But all too often, we default to an electric service without knowing there are options. The PUC is right in promoting tips and information for customers to find savings by shopping on PAPowerswitch. 
With energy choice the power is in the hands of consumers. 
Use it.

Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) speaks to supporters at The Ferndale Project on June 20, 2025 | Photo by Jackson BoazMichigan State Sen. Mallory McMorrow pushed back hard on claims by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that the U.S. is facing a “northern border crisis,” saying the Trump administration should be looking harder at homegrown extremism with the recent killing of a Minnesota lawmaker. 
“I have not talked to a single person in this state who thinks we have an issue with Canada,” McMorrow told Michigan Advance in Ferndale, where she kicked off her McMorrow on Tap Brewery Tour on Friday night.
McMorrow, a Royal Oak Democrat vying to win the nomination of her party in August 2026 for U.S. Senate, took the weekend to visit several breweries across the state.

While data from the federal government indicates that illegal crossings at the US-Canada border make up less than 1% of the almost 3 million encounters reported nationwide, Noem still claimed there was a “northern border crisis” during an event Friday in Detroit. 
McMorrow said that assertion would likely only result in scaring immigrant and border communities, while at the same time essentially ignoring the rising threat of domestic extremism, referencing the recent assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Horton, who was shot dead in her home, along with her husband, by a gunman who authorities have said appears to have been politically motivated. 
“It’s been five days and it’s barely made the news,” McMorrow said. “There’s this growing sense that government is something happening at people, not with them. That disconnect is fueling the extremism we’re seeing.”
Despite that, McMorrow said she and her team have ramped up in-person events to try and restore public trust and lower the political temperature.
“If we can just meet people, grab a beer, and get to know each other, they’ll see I’m not some troll they saw in a viral video—I’m a mom. I live in your neighborhood,” McMorrow told the Advance just prior to addressing supporters at The Ferndale Project brewery.
McMorrow was the first Democrat to announce her intention to run for U.S. Senate after Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) said he would not seek reelection. 
She has since been joined by former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), and former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate. On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) is, so far, the lone GOP candidate.
McMorrow said that while the atmosphere of fear and misinformation has contributed to widespread frustration over that political divide, that’s not what she primarily hears about on the campaign trail.
“There are way too many people across the state who say, ‘I have done everything right and I’m still getting screwed. I still can’t afford to buy a house. I can’t afford to save for retirement. I would love to start a family, but I can’t afford it.’ And even for people who may have voted for Trump, they’re saying loudly now, this has done nothing to lower my costs,” McMorrow said. 
McMorrow also expressed frustration with House Republicans over the stalled state budget process. 
With a July 1 deadline looming to pass a new state budget, she accused House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) of making sweeping promises—including eliminating the state income tax and increasing per-pupil school funding to $12,000 —without proposing a viable budget.
“He’s painted himself into a corner,” McMorrow said. “You can promise the world, but at the end of the day, we have to pass a budget. People are counting on us.”
She added that Republican committee chairs have been hesitant to even begin negotiations with their Democratic counterparts. “That should’ve been happening months ago,” she said.
Still, McMorrow was cautiously optimistic that mounting pressure could push forward bipartisan cooperation. 
“It feels like there is some softening,” she said. “At the end of the day, we have a job to do.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05040-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 12:16:28.481099

(Photo by Joe Cook/Georgia Rivers)An Alabama company that was close to receiving the final go-ahead from the state of Georgia to mine near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge has decided to instead sell the land to a nonprofit focused on conserving at-risk sites.
Twin Pines Minerals, which first proposed the controversial mining project in 2019, is in the process of selling about 8,000 acres near the refuge to The Conservation Fund. Twin Pines’ president Steve Ingle confirmed the sale through his public relations firm but declined further comment Friday.
The nearly $60 million land deal will halt a mining project that became the poster child of the first Trump administration’s move to scale back federal protections for the nation’s waterways. That left the decision on whether to approve the project in the hands of state regulators, who issued draft permits early last year that were close to being finalized.
The sale presents a second time a mining proposal near the swamp was thwarted due to public outcry. A DuPont proposal in the 1990s near the refuge faced intense pressure, and the company eventually dropped the project and sold the land to The Conservation Fund.
Stacy Funderburke, who serves as vice president of The Conservation Fund’s central Southeast region, said efforts to buy the land around Trail Ridge — the mineral-rich target of mining companies that is seen as an important barrier for the swamp — had been in the works for roughly three years. The deal includes the mineral rights for the site.
“This is the most important conservation project that we’ve ever worked on because of how imminent the threat was, not only to this site, but to the entire Okefenokee Swamp,” Funderburke said.
The sale is set to be completed by the end of July, though The Conservation Fund hopes to continue raising money from private donors and foundations. Currently, there are between 10 and 15 major donors who are funding the project, and more expected to contribute down the road, Funderburke said.
Funderburke also credits environmental activists across Georgia for their work drawing awareness to the swamp, which he said was a key factor in acquiring the philanthropic backing needed to purchase the land.
“The public response since this threat started six years ago — all the work that’s been done, and all the voices of people across Georgia that have come out and said that it’s not worth the risk to a place like the Okefenokee to have mining immediately next door — that is why I think funders and others have been willing to step up to the table,” he said. “It’s really hearing the loud voice of everyone who wants to see this protected.”
The refuge has also been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which would cement its status as an international tourist destination on par with the Grand Canyon and Galápagos Islands. It spans 402,000 acres in southeastern Georgia and North Florida.
 ‘Settled in a good way’

The mining proposal sparked a public outcry and was at the center of a yearslong debate at the state Capitol, where lawmakers from both parties pushed for protections for Trail Ridge.
Rep. Darlene Taylor, a Thomasville Republican who has become known as one of the swamp’s chief defenders at the statehouse, said Friday that she was delighted by the news.
“Protecting the swamp was what it was all about, and I just feel so much better knowing that it’s going to be secure,” Taylor said.
Taylor said the announced land deal is an ideal compromise.
“It was settled in a good way,” she said. “I think everybody in it can be pretty calm about it at this point. [The Okefenokee Swamp is] being protected, they’re being compensated for it, and we can move forward now.”
U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, had opposed the project from Washington.
“This step toward protecting the Okefenokee Swamp is great news for all Georgians and our beloved natural treasure,” he said in a statement. “For years, I’ve been sounding the alarm that strip mining near the Okefenokee Swamp poses irreversible damage to an irreplaceable natural resource.”
 ‘A model for protecting Trail Ridge’

From the start, the mining project was met with concerns about the potential impact on the swamp’s water levels and an ecosystem that is home to thousands of species of animals and plants.
A broad coalition that included environmental groups, faith leaders, and others relentlessly warned of the project’s potential harm to the largest blackwater swamp in North America.
Those groups helped galvanize an army of Okefenokee Swamp fans who flooded state regulators any time public input was sought along the way.
“This is an incredibly special outcome and there is no place more deserving than the Okefenokee,” said Megan Huynh, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Georgians sent a clear message to Twin Pines Minerals that mining next to the Okefenokee is an unacceptable risk.
“This wouldn’t have been possible without a powerful coalition, and regular Georgians who were willing to stand up and defend a place as beloved as the Okefenokee,” Huynh said.
Rena Ann Peck, executive director of Georgia Rivers, said the deal will help pave the way to conserve more of Trail Ridge. There are still more than 25,000 acres left vulnerable to mining, Peck said.
“I think this is a model for protecting Trail Ridge, the outright land conservation through acquisition and conservation easements,” Peck said. “Retiring the mining rights is paramount to saving it in perpetuity.”
As an advocate, Peck was a vocal critic of the Twin Pines’ proposal. But she said her favorite part of the job is bringing potential land conservation buyers to the Okefenokee in hopes of helping them form a connection with the swamp.
“I show them the vastness,” she said. “I like to say that you can paddle these 120 miles of canoe trails and still only see 2% of the swamp.”

McMillan, who grew up in Hickory, served as the Secretary-Treasurer of the North Carolina AFL-CIO from 2005 to 2017, at which point she was elected as the first woman president of the federation in the state’s history – a role that she has served in ever since and will retire from later this summer.
And recently, as she prepared for her final months in office, McMillan was kind enough to join NC Newsline to share some reflections on the state of the labor movement and on her years of service – the victories, the frustrations, and some of the key challenges that lie ahead for her movement and the working people it strives to represent.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)When University of Iowa researcher and assistant professor Boeun Kim worked as a nurse, some of the older adults she treated would have problems that no health care professional can solve — low income, a small or nonexistent support network and less access to healthy food.
Pair any of these issues with growing older and many patients were experiencing cognitive decline in some way, Kim said. A study from the researcher and colleagues at John Hopkins and Columbia universities found that people over the age of 65 living in urban areas lacking healthy food options saw a faster decline in cognitive abilities than their peers.
Kim said she hopes to expand her study to different living situations and geographical areas, and hopes the information will eventually lead to changes in policy and practice in places where healthy food is harder to find.
“I really want to support them, but I feel like … I could not provide the optimal care for them because of issues with communication and other symptoms, but at the same time I also felt frustrated, because there is no cure for dementia for now,” Kim said. “So I felt like I should intervene at the prevention level, like at the community (level,) before they come into the hospital.”

It was during her time as a nurse when Kim first became interested in cognitive functions, she said, as people would come in with a cognitive impairment and have difficulties communicating with staff, made worse by additional symptoms like anxiety and delirium.
Kim said she was unable to help patients with the factors leading to their decline, namely poverty and lack of resources where they lived. While specific medical needs could be addressed, Kim said she couldn’t solve their food insecurity or the chronic stress that can develop as a result.
Having an unhealthy diet can lead to greater risks of developing diabetes and other conditions that can contribute to cognitive decline, Kim said, including obesity and hypertension.
Using datasets from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and National Health and Aging Trends Study, the research team narrowed their search to people 65 or older, living in urban areas also designated as “unhealthy food environments.” These locations were described by Kim as areas without a grocery store or supermarket that also have a lower-income population.
“We found that individuals living in both high poverty level and then low food (options) in the area experience faster declines in cognitive function over time, among all those who live in the urban communities,” Kim said.
People with disabilities, who have a low income and who are marginalized are more likely to be living in these areas, Kim said, and are experiencing other structural barriers and hardships in addition to food insecurity. This problem worsens health disparities for these populations, she added, and she wants to make these environments more equitable.
In the future, Kim said she wants to look at the same age group but in rural areas, to see how food deserts in Iowa and their impact on older adults compares to what she found in urban areas across the U.S. She also wants to introduce other variables, like transportation capabilities and price of food, to further study the issue.
While the study itself does not identify solutions that would combat this problem best, Kim said the findings will hopefully prompt conversation among community leaders and lawmakers about how to solve urban healthy food insecurity. There won’t be any catch-all fix, she said, but expanding community food assistance and delivery programs and incentivizing people with healthy food businesses like grocery stores to settle in the area could be a good start.
Teaching people about better behaviors, like eating healthy and exercising, can only go so far when there are structural barriers to improving a lifestyle, she said.
“I really feel like we should make the environment better first, then emphasize that you should improve your behaviors,” Kim said.

Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, said Trump should have sought approval of Congress for bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities. (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Members of the Kansas congressional delegation praised U.S. military forces following the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities, but disagreed as to whether President Donald Trump threatened to draw the United States in a lengthy conflict or exercised “peace through strength.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of the 3rd District in the Kansas City area said she awaited intelligence reports on whether Saturday’s attacks by the United States effectively addressed dangers posed by three Iranian nuclear facilities.
“But, let me be clear, President Trump’s unilateral decision to launch military action against Iran without constitutionally mandated congressional approval puts American troops and global stability at risk and threatens another endless war,” Davids said.
Other Democrats in Congress echoed Davids’ concern and complained the Trump administration should have notified top Democratic congressional lawmakers ahead of the bombing.
U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, a Republican serving the 1st District, said he supported Trump’s military strategy of promoting “American peace through strength.” He said he was praying for safety of U.S. civilians and troops in the Middle East.
The mission authorized by Trump thrust the United States into military conflict between Israel and Iran that began in early June.
U.S. pilots flying B-2 stealth aircraft stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri successfully executed the precision bombing of Iranian facilities tied to nuclear programs, said U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt, the 2nd District Republican.
“Years ago, President Reagan’s resolve freed American hostages from the Iranian regime. I am hopeful … President Trump’s resolve has freed America from that same regime’s ongoing threat of nuclear terrorism,” Schmidt said.
Iran should be viewed as an adversary of the United States and shouldn’t be allowed to control nuclear weapons, said U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican. He said U.S. military forces ought to be “vigilant in protecting against any Iranian threats to Americans around the globe.”
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, said “we stand tall with President Trump who is protecting the world from a nuclear-capable Iran.”
Marshall previously said he was certain Trump wouldn’t draw the United States into “another endless war.” The senator also said he would welcome “regime change” in the Iranian government.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, the 4th District congressman from the Wichita area, said Trump was committed to preventing Iran from emerging as a nuclear power.
“Iran — a regime that espouses ‘death to America’ and supports terrorism — chose to continue to pursue the development of nuclear weapons.
